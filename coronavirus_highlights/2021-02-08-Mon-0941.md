## Japanese doctors warn of long-lasting COVID-19 aftereffects among young people

Summary of [original article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/02/07/national/covid-aftereffects-long-lasting/):

> Doctors are warning that many people who contract the coronavirus, especially younger patients, are suffering aftereffects for a lengthy period of time despite subsequently testing negative for the virus. The number of women among all patients was 1.4 times that of men. Koichi Hirahata, head of the clinic, suspects that a "Cytokine storm," a severe autoimmune response in which a patient's immune system attacks healthy organs, might be one of the causes of the long-term aftereffects.
