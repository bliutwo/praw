> Obligatory sticky: I am not qualified to give medical advice. I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

> Signs of another COVID-19 rebound in Tokyo are beginning to emerge only days after the capital's state of emergency was lifted.

The delta variant could account for half of all new cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area by early July, according to projections by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.
