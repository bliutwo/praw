## I am Debora MacKenzie. I’m a science journalist and I just wrote a book called COVID-19: The Pandemic That Never Should have Happened and How to Stop the Next One. It’s about the big picture: why Covid, why now, what next. AMA!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hqhyd0/i_am_debora_mackenzie_im_a_science_journalist_and/):

> We even had a few false alarms with closely-related viruses, and we knew where this virus lived - and how to avoid it. Why should this pandemic never have happened? Because we knew about these viruses, and that they live in some bats. There are more viruses in other wild or farm animals that could also go pandemic.

## WhiteHouse seeks to discredit Fauci in memo leaked to reporters Administration sources say he's sometimes referred to as "Dr. Gloom and Doom."

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/white-house-seeks-discredit-fauci-memo-leaked-reporters/story?id=71745265&cid=social_fb_abcn):

> The White House has taken the unusual step of attacking a member of its coronavirus task force, by providing a document to several media outlets that contains a list of comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in an effort to damage his reputation. The news of the document comes as two senior level White House sources tell ABC News that Fauci has at times been referred to among aides to President Donald Trump as "Dr. Gloom and Doom.". The document, obtained by ABC News from sources who confirmed the effort to discredit Fauci, says in part that "Several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."

## Anti-Mask Idiots Rally at Florida Restaurant as State Becomes Covid-19 Epicenter

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/anti-mask-idiots-rally-at-florida-restaurant-as-state-b-1844359920):

> Anti-mask advocates rallied over the weekend at a restaurant in Florida, the current covid-19 capital of the world, insisting that no one should wear a mask to fight the spread of the deadly disease. The anti-mask rally took place on Saturday at 33 & Melt, a bar and restaurant in Windermere, Florida that's owned by Carrie Hudson, an activist who believes the coronavirus pandemic is little more than media-driven hype. Florida reported over 15,000 new cases of the disease on Sunday, the highest one-day total of any state in the country, surpassing New York's record tally of over 12,000 infections in 24 hours, reached in April.

> It always amazes me how many who call this a hoax or are against masks would easily fall in the high risk category for mortality or other severe health consequences if they contract this. Example: lady on the left.

## ‘The beginning of a horror movie’? Disney World slammed as doors reopen amid spiking coronavirus cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-beginning-of-a-horror-movie-disney-world-slammed-as-doors-reopen-amid-spiking-coronavirus-cases-2020-07-12):

> Florida on Sunday broke the national record for the biggest single-day number of positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, following a week in which the Sunshine State saw 514 people die of the disease, or 73 each day, on average. CNN business editor Alexis Benveniste said it "Feels like the beginning of a horror movie," and the internet mostly agreed, considering the creative edits that began popping up all over Twitter. "Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here."

## Adulthood interrupted: Millions of Gen Zers move back into their parents' homes

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/living-in-sf/article/Gen-Zers-COVID-moving-home-depression-15399559.php):

> Thirty-two million adults lived with their parents in April 2020, the highest number on record, and more than 80% of those who recently moved back in with their parents are Gen Zers - widely accepted as 18- to 25-year-olds in 2020 - per a recent report from Zillow. Dr. Jennifer Dragonette, executive director of Newport Institute, told SFGATE that "Moving back home with parents or grandparents after living on their own can greatly impact young adults by making them feel as though they are taking a step backwards. It also may make them feel as though they are missing important milestones in adulthood including living independently, supporting oneself financially, and major life events like starting a first job, having a serious relationship, and more." "Parents can help by acknowledging how their teens are feeling, including the sadness and disappointment over missing graduation, spring break, summer travel and other important events in their lives. Sometimes, parents worry that by validating or reflecting back hard feelings, they might inadvertently encourage their child to remain sad. However, quite the opposite is true: Letting your loved ones know that you can understand how they feel and that their feelings make sense creates space for the grief and disappointment so it can be expressed and felt in a healthy way," Dragonette said.

## Should face masks be mandatory nationwide to control the coronavirus outbreak?

Summary of [original article](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2020/07/12/should-face-masks-be-mandatory-nationwide-as-virus-cases-surge/24558336/):

> In response, an increasing number of state and local governments have made masks mandatory for all indoor activities and outdoor activities when social distancing isn't possible. A mask mandate might have prevented the current surge in coronavirus cases. "There's no doubt at this point that masks keep people safer from COVID-19. But certain types of masks may also be putting young Black men in danger of harassment or profiling." - Political scientist Marc Hetherington to FiveThirtyEight.

`/u/ssldvr` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hq6kz8/should_face_masks_be_mandatory_nationwide_to/):

> The fact this is even a question, and that it is still being asked with thousands of people infected and dying, shows how screwed up this country is.

## Florida records more new COVID-19 cases than all of Europe combined

Summary of [original article](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/florida-records-more-new-covid-19-cases-than-all-of-europe-combined/):

> That's more than all the new cases in Europe combined, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute told the Today Show's Savannah Guthrie on Monday. "The situation in Florida is pretty worrisome. There were more cases yesterday in Florida than all of Europe yesterday, and this is obviously a situation that is getting worse," Jha said. Jha blamed the spike in cases on Florida opening too early and too aggressively, and Florida leaders being too slow to react.

`/u/Orsty` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hqg7db/florida_records_more_new_covid19_cases_than_all/):

> It’s because Florida‘a tax policy is unsustainable.  All states need to have the tax base to withstand a major crisis, unfortunately Florida has a very limited ability to tax its citizens and the result is that they literally cannot shut down no matter how bad it gets.
