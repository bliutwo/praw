## First Thing: July was the worst month of the pandemic so far in the US

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/03/first-thing-july-worst-month-of-pandemic-so-far-in-the-us):

> More than 8m coronavirus infections were recorded worldwide in July, almost as many as in the first six months of the global pandemic put together. On Sunday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Trump was planning to take unspecified actions against Chinese software companies, which Pompeo claimed were "Feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist party, their national security apparatus". For the first time in modern US history, the press will not be invited to witness the formal nomination of a major party's presidential candidate, after a Republican spokesperson told the Associated Press that media would be banned from the GOP convention in Charlotte later this month because of coronavirus concerns.

## Nobody Accurately Tracks Health Care Workers Lost to COVID-19. So She Stays Up At Night Cataloging the Dead.

Summary of [original article](https://www.propublica.org/article/nobody-accurately-tracks-health-care-workers-lost-to-covid-19-so-she-stays-up-at-night-cataloging-the-dead):

> Based on state data and past epidemics, Sepkowitz said he'd expect health care workers to make up 5% to 15% of all coronavirus infections in the U.S. That would put the number of workers who've contracted the virus at over 200,000, and maybe much higher. "We are not collecting data on health care worker infections and/or health care worker deaths from COVID-19," a spokesperson for the Michigan Health Department said in an email. To Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociologist at Washington University and author of "Flatlining: Race, Work, and Health Care in the New Economy," some of the most pressing questions relate to disparities: "Where is this virus hitting our health care workers hardest?" Is the impact falling disproportionately on certain categories of workers - for example, doctors vs. registered nurses vs. nursing aides - on certain types of facilities, or in certain parts of the country? Are providers who serve lower-income communities of color more likely to become ill?

> >[...]Through the end of July, nearly 120,000 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel had contracted the virus in the U.S., the CDC reported; at least 587 had died.
> 
> >Even those numbers are almost certainly “a gross underestimate,” said Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City who has studied medical worker deaths from HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and flu.    
>     
> >... Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports at least 767 deaths among nursing home staff, making the work “the most dangerous job in America,” a Washington Post op-ed declared. National Nurses United, a union with more than 150,000 members nationwide, has counted at least 1,289 deaths among all categories of health care professionals, including 169 nurses.....
