## US marks 277,000 Covid cases in 24 hours, a new record

> WASHINGTON: The United States on Saturday saw its highest number yet of coronavirus cases recorded in one day, with more than 277,000 infections. The hardest-hit country in the world by the pandemic, the United States has marked 20.4 million cases overall and just under 350,000 deaths. More than 4.2 million people in the US have already received their first jabs, with 13 million doses distributed, but that falls well behind the 20 million inoculations that President Donald Trump's administration promised by the end of 2020.

> This pandemic has really soured me on attending any type of church services. Ever.  I feel like there is a message being delivered by the churches, the leadership, and perpetuated by their congregations. Its dangerous to ignore science, and that is exactly what this population is doing.  Why?  I was raised christian, but feel the majority of organized religious institutes are in it for the money and the prestige.  The extreme anti mask culture i keep witnessing blows my mind.  They think god will save or take them depending on his plan for them, and they dont have to be mindful of anyone else because of that.  Blows my mind how they are watching their congregatioms die and gathering maskless for large dinners memorializing those who have passed.
