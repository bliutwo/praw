> White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday that he and his family are receiving hate mail and "Serious threats" from people angry over his advice on the pandemic. Known for his candid advice, Fauci has often opposed President Donald Trump in recommending school closures, state lockdowns and the use of face masks in public areas where social distancing isn't possible. "In the past, President Donald Trump and other White House officials have criticized Fauci's advice on Covid-19. During an interview earlier this month with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump said Dr. Fauci's a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes."
