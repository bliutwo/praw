## California’s coronavirus hospitalizations hit all-time low

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/01/covid-californias-coronavirus-hospitalizations-hit-all-time-low):

> Coronavirus hospitalizations in California have dropped to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, fueled by a surge in vaccinations and one of the lowest case rates in the country. Across the 10-county Bay Area, there were just 360 people hospitalized with COVID-19, fewer than at any time of the pandemic except for a few days last June when hospitalizations briefly dropped to the low 350s. One day last week, not a single person with the coronavirus came through the Stanford Hospital emergency department. Unlike in the past, when dips in hospitalizations came with the real threat of a surge just around the corner, this decline feels more stable.

> I think the all time low was probably in 2018.
