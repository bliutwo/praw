## Most Americans support single, national strategy to combat COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/npr-covid-19-strategy-and-immigration):

> Washington, DC, August 4, 2020 - As the death toll around COVID-19 continues to climb, a new NPR/Ipsos poll shows that a strong majority of Americans favor a single, national strategy to combat the virus. Two-thirds of Americans believe our country is handling the pandemic worse than other countries and favor a single, national strategy for combatting the virus' spread. Strong majorities are in favor of government funding to expand COVID-19 testing and make it free of charge, federal funding to manufacture protective equipment and make a COVID-19 vaccine available to all Americans, enacting state laws to require mask wearing in public at all times, and a single, national strategy for when businesses and schools can reopen. Most Americans support a mandatory, nationwide two-week shelter-at-home order, and the same number believe the government should take on more debt to provide Americans with a stipend so they can do this.
