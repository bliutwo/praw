## NFL tells Biden all team stadiums will be made available as mass vaccination sites

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/nfl-stadiums-vaccines-biden-44355d94-8d13-495f-8e8a-2a51f1c18df7.html):

> On the eve of Super Bowl weekend, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote President Biden to tell him that each of the league's 32 teams "Will make its stadium available for mass vaccinations of the general public." The NFL is treating 7,500 vaccinated health care workers from across the country to seats in the pandemic-shrunk crowd for Sunday's game in Tampa. Goodell's letter says the NFL is "Committed to doing our part to ensure that vaccines are as widely accessible in our communities as possible."

## Covid stimulus package worth $1.9 trillion clears Senate after Kamala Harris gives tie breaking vote

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/covid-stimulus-package-senate-kamala-harris-b1798087.html):

> The US Senate has passed a budget resolution in a step that sets up the path for Democrats to pass President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.9trn Covid-19 relief package. The measure passed 51-50 on a party line vote with Vice President Kamala Harris casting her first-ever tie-breaking vote to tip the balance in the early hours of Friday morning. Democrats will need near-universal support from House Democrats and a unanimous vote of the 50-Democratic members of the Senate to pass the bill without Republican support.

`/u/YourWebcam` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ld64e2/covid_stimulus_package_worth_19_trillion_clears/):

> This does **not** mean that stimulus legislation has passed yet. It simply means that they voted to allow a simple majority to pass the package when they actually vote on it in the future.
