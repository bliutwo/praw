> Eminem has entered the debate about face masks in a collaboration with Kid Cudi, tackling an issue that is the subject of fierce disagreement in the US and UK. The single, The Adventures of Moon Man and Slim Shady, is the first time the two rappers have joined forces. The president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said on Monday that refusing to wear a mask in indoor public settings should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt. The collaboration between Eminem and Kid Cudi was announced on Twitter on Wednesday by Kid Cudi's daughter, Vada.

## Fauci: “I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately”

Summary of [original article](https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e):

> The president flouts his advice - refusing to wear a mask and holding rallies - and, Fauci tells me, hasn't even met him for more than a month. Fauci may have developed a fan base that is snapping up Fauci T-shirts, mugs and bobblehead dolls - but he has also been disparaged and even received death threats from people who believe coronavirus is a con. Fauci has a fine line to tread. In an interview with Science magazine in March, he said that when Trump makes a mistake, he prefers to get Trump's advisers to correct him for next time.

> Things are about to get a lot shittier. Fauci’s boss doesn’t care, and neither do a lot of Americans.
