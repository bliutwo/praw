## Pfizer says it has second doses of COVID-19 shot on hand, expects no U.S. supply problems

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-idUSKBN29K2LR?taid=600250db947f630001ccbb11&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter):

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has been holding on to second doses for each of its COVID-19 vaccinations at the request of the federal government and anticipates no problems supplying them to Americans, a spokeswoman said in a statement on Friday. Pfizer's comments run counter to a report in the Washington Post that the federal government ran down its vaccine reserve in late December and has no remaining reserves of doses on hand. Pfizer has shipped more than 15 million doses to destinations around the United States, primarily from its Michigan facility, and expects to be able to produce around 2 billion doses worldwide in 2021, the spokeswoman said.

## The kids aren’t alright: How Generation Covid is losing out

Summary of [original article](https://www.ft.com/content/0dec0291-2f72-4ce9-bd9f-ae2356bd869e):

> Many respondents said they were losing faith in their leaders and felt that the pandemic had been poorly handled - with the exception of some Europeans and respondents from parts of Asia. "Young people are hustlers, every youth out there wants to be better but this pandemic ruined things, restricted movements, schools were shut down, some businesses crashed". In the FT survey, Anders Furze, 30, from Albury, Australia, said he had realised that he was burning the candle at both ends before the pandemic: "I was out five nights a week: having dinners, attending film screenings, theatre shows."

`/u/FirstofFirsts` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kyodxx/the_kids_arent_alright_how_generation_covid_is/):

> We have kids in America who haven’t stepped into a school in almost a year. That’s going to result in some lasting damage for young kids...especially minority and poor students.
> 
> Over 70% of Black kids in LA public schools couldn’t read to their expected age level...pre-pandemic.
