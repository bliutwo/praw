## Canadian athletes say vaccine priority must go to vulnerable individuals, not Olympians

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/1.5866593):

> Reigning Olympic wrestling gold medallist Erica Wiebe instantly thought of her parents upon reading the headline. While he understands the economic incentives of the IOC, Shewfelt adds, "Our entire society has been ripped to the core, businesses are closed, people are dying. As much as I want the Olympics to move forward - because I love the Olympics - there's isn't a doubt in my mind where [vaccines] need to go. The Olympics can still move ahead safely, regardless of whether athletes get vaccinated or not." "Sorry, I've trained for 20 years in [Gymnastics]. I went to three Olympic Games and they were the most important moments in my life. But the vaccine is a larger societal problem. And the solution is getting it to the most vulnerable and exposed; not to the athletes."

## Autopsy concludes that woman’s death was not due to the vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-01-06/autopsy-concludes-that-woman-s-death-was-not-due-to-the-vaccine/57533):

> By TPN/Lusa, in News  06-01-2021 08:00:00  9 Comments The autopsy on the Oporto IPO official who died two days after being vaccinated against Covid-19 concluded that the cause of death was not due to the vaccine, the government explained on 6 January. "It is informed, without any reference to the cause of death, which is covered by the secrecy of justice, that the preliminary data resulting from the medical-legal autopsy carried out today [5 January] do not show any link between the death and the vaccine to which it was subjected," states a statement from the Ministry of Justice. "Don't be afraid" of Covid-19 vaccine.

## California reports record 695 virus deaths in a day

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/e2e452109bea577cc2cf8ae4d89bfc7f):

> Every intensive care unit bed at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard is full, and emergency rooms are packed across Ventura County, about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, the Ventura County Star reported. "The speed with which we are reaching grim milestones of COVID-19 deaths and cases is a devastating reflection of the immense spread that is occurring across the county," said Barbara Ferrer, public health director for Los Angeles County. Dr. Paul Simon, the county Department of Public Health's chief science officer, told the Los Angeles Times he expects the number of hospitalizations and deaths to remain high throughout January because of what occurred over the holidays.
