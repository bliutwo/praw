## Covid-19 Data Will Once Again Be Collected by CDC, in Policy Reversal

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/troubled-covid-19-data-system-returning-to-cdc-11597945770?mod=djem10point):

> Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus coordinator, told hospital executives and government officials in Arkansas this week that the current system under which hospitals report new cases is "Solely an interim system" and that the reporting would soon go back to the CDC. "CDC is working with us right now to build a revolutionary new data system so it can be moved back to the CDC, and they can have that regular accountability with hospitals relevant to treatment and PPE," Dr. Birx said, referring to personal protective equipment used by doctors and nurses. The HHS instructed hospitals last month to no longer report numbers on new cases, hospital capacity, inventories of key supplies and other data through the CDC's National Health Safety Network. "We track across our region things like hospitalization numbers, and we've increasingly noticed it being more difficult for hospitals to meet daily deadlines. We still see hospitals that just have no data reported for the day."

> Hallelujah-I’d love to believe this was a decision based on integrity and choosing to do what is right, but I imagine it was closer to “this is too hard, I don’t wanna do it anymore ☹️“

## Wuhan officials tried to hide coronavirus information from China’s central leadership

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/wuhan-coronavirus-china-information-covid-hubei-province-a9678836.html):

> US intelligence officials claim that local officials in China kept the devastation caused by the coronavirus in its earliest days away from the broader Chinese government for weeks, slowing the nation's ability to respond to the virus before it began to spread. The intelligence report, detailed in a New York Times story, concluded that city officials in Wuhan and in Hubei Province, where the virus first emerged, attempted to hide the information from the central Chinese government. US officials claim that local officials withholding information from the central government is not uncommon. As the economic situation in the US inflamed by the coronavirus continues to worsen, some experts fear China may be positioning itself to be the world's dominant economic superpower.

`/u/AgreeablePie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/iduztp/wuhan_officials_tried_to_hide_coronavirus/):

> This is just the standard modus operandi in China. Local officials don't tell the higher ups and the higher ups don't make an effort to find out... unless it becomes politically unviable to hide it in which case they come down on a few scapegoats.
