> That’s more than World War 2 and Korea combined. What kinds of Government action were taken to win that war vs winning the Covid war? And here we have an administration that thinks wearing a mask is too much to ask.

## Kansas issued a face mask order. Counties that opted out saw COVID-19 cases rise 100% in 6 weeks, CDC says

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/11/21/covid-19-kansas-face-masks-prevented-rise-coronavirus-cases/6373257002/):

> Gov. Laura Kelly issued a face mask mandate in early July, and the counties that upheld the order saw a decline in cases, while the counties that opted out saw cases rise, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday. As of mid-August, 24 of Kansas's 105 counties had abided by the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate, and 81 counties had opted out, as Kansas law allows. Kansas is among 37 states that mandate the wearing of face masks in public to curb the spread of COVID-19, according to a list maintained by AARP. Other states have recommended wearing face masks but have not implemented statewide orders.

## People Are Waiting Hours for COVID Tests—but Tests Don’t Guarantee a Safe Thanksgiving

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/coronavirus-testing-long-lines-thanksgiving.html):

> Justice November 19, 2020 Long line of vehicles trying to get to a coronavirus testing site in AA Co. Some of the traffic is local that got caught up in the line for a test. "A test is valid only for a certain point in time. You can test negative one day and be positive the next," Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told the Washington Post. Experts recommend getting tested five to seven days after you return, so expect the testing demand to continue beyond Thanksgiving.

`/u/Juicyjackson` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jya9zf/people_are_waiting_hours_for_covid_testsbut_tests/):

> I'm actually super happy with my cousins, we were able to get our family to just do a virtual thanksgiving instead of an in person one, with there being like 7000 new cases of Covid in PA, it's not worth it, if this was the summer where we were only having a couple hundred, it would have happened.
