## Workers at U.S. meat plants, early Covid hot spots, are now getting vaccinated in many states.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/covid-vaccine-meat-plants.html):

> The expansion of vaccines to food processing workers comes amid rapid widening of eligibility, especially for essential workers at greater risk of contracting the virus. Eligibility opened to many food processing workers in early March across much of the Midwest, where meatpacking and food production are a major part of the economy and often a source of employment for recent immigrants. In Kansas, where food processing workers are now eligible for the vaccine, nearly 4,000 reported cases have been tied to outbreaks in meatpacking plants, more than in any other setting except long-term care centers and correctional facilities.

## Social isolation during COVID‐19 lockdown impairs cognitive function

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3821):

> Studies examining the effect of social isolation on cognitive function typically involve older adults and/or specialist groups. We considered the effects of COVID‐19‐induced social isolation on cognitive function within a representative sample of the general population. The impact of social isolation on cognitive function should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic‐related restrictive conditions.
