Summary of [original article](https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/dogs-trained-to-detect-people-with-covid-19-49252203):

> "A True positive: the dog indicates the target odour by a 'sit' response; a False positive: the dog alerts to a non-target position; False negative: the dog fails to exhibit the trained alert in the presence of the target odour; and a True negative: the dog does not alert in the absence of the target odour." The researchers said using dogs was not new and referred to a hypothesis that was put forward in 1989, that dogs could be used to detect malignant tumours. They decided to use three types of detection dogs - explosives detection dogs, search-and-rescue dogs as well as colon cancer-detection dogs.
