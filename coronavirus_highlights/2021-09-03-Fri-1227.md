## Misinformation is bad. Good information is good.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/):

> Here are some good sources of information about COVID-19 that are written to be accessible to the general public. For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

> The moderators of this sub support efforts to more strongly combat COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit. We believe our sub is one of the best places on Reddit, and maybe the internet, to get accurate and timely information on the pandemic, and we take a strong stance against misinformation. In our opinion, it would be counterproductive to make one of the most accurate subs on Reddit private in order to combat misinformation on Reddit. If you would like to discuss the current happenings in regards to subs going private, please do so on this sticky. Feel free to share this post with others who are seeking accurate information. All other meta-drama comments will be removed. Thanks!

## ‘The ultimate selfishness’: Doctors grow frustrated as anti-vaxxers protest hospitals

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/8164697/covid-coronavirus-doctors-frustrated-anti-vaccination/):

> Some doctors and nurses are frustrated with large groups of anti-vaccination protesters outside hospitals in cities across the country and say limited health-care resources are being used to save the lives of those who decided not to protect themselves against COVID-19. "Our job is to be professional and not to be judgmental, but it's very trying for nurses and doctors and all the other health-care professionals to look at somebody who made a conscious decision not to get vaccinated." Over a dozen hospitals in Ontario have issued vaccine mandates for health-care staff.

## Child COVID-19 cases accounted for 22.4% of weekly U.S. cases as kids return to school

`/u/Meggiesauruss` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ph3x9r/child_covid19_cases_accounted_for_224_of_weekly/):

> My child is currently out of school due to covid exposure. We all got tested Wednesday, but haven’t gotten results back. 
> 
> We live in SC, and he goes to a school without any mask mandates. They do have students “distanced” but they have kids sitting in clusters of 3- so if someone in your group of 3 has COVID it’s pretty much a guarantee the other 2 children will get it as well. And my son was masked the whole time, which we all know only provides a base level of protection. He is unable to get vaccinated, he’s only 8. 
> 
> His exposure happened on Friday August 27, and we were notified Wednesday September 1. He was at school the 30,31 and 1st- although only half a day because I literally had to leave work to go pick him up from school after finding out a classmate tested positive. 
> There is no way they can stop the spread with this type of system. There’s no system. Just send your kids to school and hope and pray they don’t get covid, meanwhile when they do get covid they’re still potentially spreading it for days. 
> 
> The school nurse told me that they aren’t even reporting things directly to SC DHEC anymore, they report to the district and I guess the school district then shares info with the health department. I have no idea. 
> 
> I just know this isn’t sustainable. What is going to happen as we get into the fall/winter months? How many children will have to become sick and hospitalized before our Governor gives a shit? Maybe McMaster would care if the children were still inside a woman’s uterus.
