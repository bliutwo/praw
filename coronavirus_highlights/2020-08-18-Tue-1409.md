> The is a bit sensationalized. It is not a last ditch effort but a prudent countermeasure to mitigate the spread of the virus. Given the recent jump in cases, due to "churches", measures are needed to quickly reduce the spread because flu season is coming and schools are in session.
> 
> Reasonable churches will accept these measures because, well they're reasonable. The cults, and churches that are facades for spreading right wing ideology will jump up and down screaming communism blah, freedoms, blah, blah. Get ready for the vocal, and mentally impaired 5% to kick up a fuss while the rest of the country agrees with the measures.
