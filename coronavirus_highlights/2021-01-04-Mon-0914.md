## A Continent Where the Dead Are Not Counted - All 54 African countries put together have registered fewer Covid deaths than France. That doesn’t mean people aren’t dying from the virus.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/world/africa/africa-coronavirus-deaths-underreporting.html):

> As the coronavirus pandemic swept across the world in 2020, it became increasingly evident that in the vast majority of countries on the African continent, most deaths are never formally registered. Stéphane Helleringer, a demographer who has worked on mortality in several African countries, said that on the African continent, "There are very, very few countries that even attempt an estimation of mortality based on death records." For most African countries, the United Nations has no death data at all.

`/u/MG-10` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kpxnjg/a_continent_where_the_dead_are_not_counted_all_54/):

> Considering that in one of the most developed African countries (South Africa) the number of deaths is more than double the reported (source Nyt and others), I just can't imagine the others. However, the numbers won't still be very high because as already mentioned the average age is only 18/20 years
> 
> And if we also talk about North Africa, I remember that during the spring leaked documents showed that in the Egyptian dictatorship their death numbers were 10 times higher than the official toll, I think that now the proportion is smaller but they still have thousands of hidden deaths

> I am former EMT and also used to run EMS /NEMT. In English if your heart stops and they can't get it going, they will not transport you. In essence they will not do everything they can to save you. Normal policy is to take you to the hospital as there is always a chances something else they can do and for benefit of the family. The main reason for the policy is holding the wall is around 7-8 hours in order to transfer care to the hospital

## U.S. COVID Death Toll Projected to Surpass 500,000 Within One Month

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/us-covid-death-toll-projected-to-surpass-500000-within-one-month/ar-BB1csFDO?ocid=uxbndlbing):

> The U.S. coronavirus death toll is forecast to hit around 502,601 on February 4, while the country's daily COVID-19 death count is projected to peak about a week later at around 5,489 on February 10, according to the latest projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The U.S. coronavirus death toll is projected to surpass 500,000 by early February. The projected total death count and daily death toll would be reached if "Vaccine distribution is scaled up over 90 days" and "Governments do not re-impose mandates if cases increase," the IHME notes.

## 'Warp speed' officials say U.S. COVID vaccine distribution too slow

Summary of [original article](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-warp-covid-vaccine.html):

> President-Elect Joe Biden has been critical of the slow pace of vaccine deployment. The Trump administration has already taken that step to speed up vaccine manufacturing, the Times noted, so it's unclear how Biden's plan will differ. Biden has pledged to administer 100 million vaccine doses-enough to provide 50 million people with the two doses needed for protection-within the first 100 days of his presidency.

## New Zealand’s nationwide ‘lockdown’ to curb the spread of COVID-19 was highly effective. The effective reproductive number of its largest cluster decreased from 7 to 0.2 within the first week of lockdown. Only 19% of virus introductions resulted in more than one additional case.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20235-8):

> Notably, the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in New Zealand represented nearly all of the genomic diversity present in the global viral population, with nine second-level A and B lineages from a proposed global SARS-CoV-2 genomic nomenclature17 identified. Viruses sampled from New Zealand are colour-coded according to their genomic lineage16 as labelled in c. c The number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled in New Zealand within each lineage16. We determined the number of introductions of the virus into New Zealand as well as the changing number of local transmission lineages through time, with the latter defined as two or more New Zealand SARS-CoV-2 cases that descend from a shared introduction event of the virus into New Zealand42.

> > New Zealand is one of a handful of countries that aimed to eliminate coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
> 
> Yes. This bit is key. They aimed to stop community transmission, not simply to reduce it from incredibly high levels to slightly less incredibly high levels. The countries across the globe that made this the priority--elimination or incredibly strong suppression--were rewarded with low death rates. And their citizens get to live normal, happy lives.
> 
> I've posited for [a while now](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/klejli/i_havent_slept_since_yesterday_morning_idaho/gh9432g/) based on surveying countries with exceptionally low death rates and good record keeping that the pandemic can't be seen as controlled until the number of daily cases per million citizens is under a low integer--my theory is that this integer is somewhere around 3.
> 
> For New Zealand, with 5 million people, that means no more than 15 new cases per day. For Australia or Taiwan, with roughly 25 million, that's a limit of around 75 new cases per day. New Zealand averages 5. Australia averages 25. Taiwan averages 4. All of these countries are firmly under 3 cases per day per million.
> 
> For Vietnam, with 98 million people, that's a cap of around 300 cases per day. For China, with around 1.4 billion people, that's around 4,200 cases per day. Vietnam averages 5. China averages 23. Both of these countries are firmly under 3 cases per day per million.
> 
> Those are a few examples of countries that have the virus firmly under control and in which life has returned to 99% normality. There are many more across the globe.
> 
> In comparison, the UK, with 68 million people, would need to average at or below 204 cases per day across the entire country to have the pandemic under control. The US, with 332 million people, would need around 1000 cases per day tops...across all 50 states and DC put together. The UK is currently averaging around 52,348 cases per day, or 770 per day per million, while the US at 216,886 cases per day, is averaging 653 cases per day per million.
> 
> That is what it looks like when the pandemic is spreading uncontrollably. This is worth keeping in mind when you hear your state talking about opening up with thousands of cases. The math is easy. The work is not.
> 
> Controlling the virus doesn't mean zero cases per day. It does mean holding the number of new cases per day at an incredibly low threshold that makes it feasible to effectively test, trace, and isolate individuals, homes, neighborhoods, cities, states, or the entire country as needed. These countries also universally pair relentless squashing of community transmission with multi-week enforced quarantines of all foreign visitors; that's how they keep new cases out and internal cases down.
