Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/24/boris-johnson-says-anti-vaxxers-are-nuts-free-winter-flu-jabs):

> Boris Johnson has said people opposed to vaccinations are "Nuts" as he promotes an expanded programme of flu jabs that ministers hope will ease pressure on the NHS if there is a second wave of coronavirus this winter. "Speaking to Sky News at the surgery, Johnson urged people to take part:"We want everybody to get a flu jab in the runup to this winter. "We're aiming first of all for school children up to year seven, for pregnant women, for people over 65, people who have been shielded. But then we'll be extending it to people from 50 to 65.".

## Fauci tells MarketWatch: I would not get on a plane or eat inside a restaurant

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anthony-fauci-tells-marketwatch-i-would-not-get-on-a-plane-or-eat-inside-a-restaurant-2020-07-24):

> If September looks bad, with flu season approaching and coronavirus is still not under control, isn't January likely to be as bad or even worse for students? Are parents and children facing the possibility of a full year with no in-person schooling? "It's unpredictable. Things could change pretty rapidly. But it doesn't look like we'll be facing a full year with no in-person schooling," Fauci said. Fauci discussed air travel and why he's avoiding it, eating out and why he's avoiding that, the price of a coronavirus vaccine and who should be first in line, the mixed success of mask mandates from Dublin, Ohio to Dublin, Ireland, and lessons from his first pandemic - the HIV/AIDS crisis that eventually killed more than 32 million people worldwide. Larry Kramer, the playwright and activist who once called Fauci a "Murderer" and "Incompetent idiot," ended up a respected and beloved friend of Fauci.

> Yeah I got forced back to work to wait tables and serve people who don't wear masks and tell me I don't have to.... When I'm high risk. I am developing a deep seated resentment and loathing for customers, and that's saying a lot bc the service industry is shit at the best of times but I normally have no problem being professional.

## Doctor Runs 22 Miles Wearing Face Mask to Show it Doesn't Cut Oxygen Levels

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/masks-covid-19-doctor-oxygen-1520060):

> A doctor has run 22 miles to work and back wearing a mask to help stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around face coverings and to raise funds for charity. Tom Lawton, who works at the Bradford Royal Infirmary in Yorkshire, north England, said he decided to run with the mask on, following his concerns for people with respiratory illnesses who want to wear a mask but are too scared to do so over false information. "To make up for the fact that I'm fit and healthy, I thought if I'm running then I'm using 10 times the amount of oxygen as I would if I'm just sat here. If I can show that I can get 10 peoples worth of oxygen through the mask then hopefully someone who has a respiratory disease and wants to wear a mask, they can be reassured that it is safe thing to do."

> I wonder how many anti maskers smoke while saying masks cut off oxygen.

> My friend gave birth just a couple months ago and this very thing was her ultimate nightmare. The debate that will ensue over whether COVID-19 caused or contributed to this death will do nothing to help this baby's parents or assuage the fear it will bring to new mothers across the country. I wish people could enjoy their wonderful new babies without this sort of needless terror.

## If you can‚Äôt wear a mask due to ‚Äúmedical‚Äù reasons, airlines are now telling these passengers to find alternate travel arrangements.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/american-southwest-say-medical-exemptions-cant-be-used-to-avoid-masks.html):

> Passengers who refuse to wear masks based on medical exemptions will no longer be able to fly on American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. The U.S. airline industry was slow to adopt mandatory mask requirements for passengers at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in that country. As nearly two-thirds of U.S. states and an ever-growing list of retailers such as Walmart, Starbucks and Costco now require face coverings, airlines are instituting the strictest mask measures to date, which some travelers say is a little too late.

`/u/Zokelola` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hwoez0/if_you_cant_wear_a_mask_due_to_medical_reasons/):

> Took a Spirit Airlines flight today. Pilot said ‚Äúwearing a mask is required for this flight. If you feel you can‚Äôt wear a mask, fine, we‚Äôre happy to rebook you... for a flight in March.‚Äù
