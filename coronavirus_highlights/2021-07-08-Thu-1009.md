## Unvaccinated clusters allow Covid to mutate and put everyone at risk, doctor says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/doctor-unvaccinated-clusters-allow-covid-to-mutate-and-increase-risk.html):

> "It's not just that vaccinations work, it's that we have to vaccinate the whole world, and the more people that are unvaccinated or remain unvaccinated, the virus replicates. As it replicates, it mutates, and the more efficient it gets with mutations, that's where you get variants like delta," said Patel, a former Obama administration policy aide. The World Health Organization described the delta variant as the "Fastest and fittest" variant yet, and data shows it could be up to 60% more contagious than the original variant, alpha. Patel echoed Fauci and raised concerns about unvaccinated clusters becoming breeding grounds for the next Covid variant.

> Though true, the *much* bigger risk we have in mutation is not in a mostly vaccinated 1st world country, it's in a mostly unvaccinated third world country where covid runs rampant.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/tokyo-lifestyle-health-coronavirus-pandemic-olympic-games-5fe54df9b5c06abbc54a633cbd0d907e):

> TOKYO - Fans are likely to be banned from the Tokyo Olympics following a state of emergency on Thursday aimed at containing rising COVID-19 infections in the capital. The extent of the ban, which comes just two weeks before the pandemic-postponed Olympics open, will be announced later on Thursday by the International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers. The uptick in infections has also forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off capital streets, allowing it to run only on remote islands off the Tokyo coast.

> >The uptick in infections has also forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off capital streets, allowing it to run only on remote islands off the Tokyo coast. It’s unclear how the torch will enter the stadium for the opening ceremony.
> 
> It must be strange for athletes to compete without any spectators.  The Opening Ceremony is very weird too without spectators.
