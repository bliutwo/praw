## FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/owyf0w/faq_recent_cdc_guidance_vaccine_data_and_the/):

> Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.

## F.D.A. Aims to Give Final Approval to Pfizer Vaccine by Early Next Month

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-approval.html?referringSource=articleShare):

> Moderna, the second most widely used vaccine in the United States, filed for final approval of its vaccine on June 1. The F.D.A.'s decision to speed up was reported last week by Stat News.In a guest essay in The Times last month, Dr. Peter Marks, the agency's top vaccine regulator, wrote that undue haste "Would undermine the F.D.A.'s statutory responsibilities, affect public trust in the agency and do little to help combat vaccine hesitancy." Officials in Contra Costa County, home to 1.1 million people in Northern California, were so eager to offer boosters that on July 23 they told vaccine providers to give extra shots to people who asked for them "Without requiring further documentation or justification."

> I applaud this but you know people who were "waiting for FDA approval" will now say that this was rushed.

## Crowded Lollapalooza music festival could bring cascade of Covid cases, experts warn

> At this point in the pandemic, Tan said the only safe way to hold such a large music festival would be to do it virtually. Landon, the executive medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Chicago Medicine, told NBC Chicago last week that the festival could cause "Wildfires of infection" across the country. Chicago Sun Times columnist Laura Washington said in a column published Sunday that with the festival over, questions remain about how effective the festival's Covid-19 restrictions were.

> this actually makes sense from a mitigation perspective too. I was surprised to learn that the majority of ppl testing positive in the past few weeks in LA are in high-income urban professional enclaves where many of these very restaurants are located. I was caught off-guard that so many college-educated ppl with 6 figure incomes are forgoing the shots, particularly those under 40. 
> 
> You think your friends & colleagues are of the same covid mindset as you, but really they aren't. It's really sad that it's come to this, but if you're refusing the shot & still socializing and eating out, you're putting everyone else around you at risk. And that's unfair to those who've done their part to get vaccinated.

> Aug. 3, 2021.New York City will become the first U.S. city to require proof of at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine for a variety of activities for workers and customers - indoor dining, gyms and performances - to put pressure on people to get vaccinated, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday morning. About 66 percent of adults in the city are fully vaccinated, according to city data, although pockets of the city have lower rates. Can your employer require a vaccine? Companies can require workers entering the workplace to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to recent U.S. government guidance...To enter indoor venues, patrons must use the city's new app, the state's Excelsior app or a paper card to show proof of vaccination.

> The size of the cards is awkward. Too big for a wallet slot or pocket. Fold it and it's gonna get illegible soon.  Maybe cut it to size and then laminating it? Anybody got got any good ideas?

> Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday that he regrets signing a mask mandate ban into law. "There is no state wide mask mandate. I'm not in favor of a statewide mask mandate. There are no government vaccine mandates as well, but we do have a vulnerable group that is not eligible for the vaccine," said Hutchinson. Hutchinson expressed his support for an amendment to the mask mandate ban to allow for school districts to enact mask wearing rules.
