## Cuba's COVID vaccine rivals BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/cubas-covid-vaccine-rivals-biontech-pfizer-moderna/a-58052365):

> In a measure of its ambitious efforts to be vaccine self-reliant, Cuba has named one of its homegrown jabs Abdala, after a famous dramatic verse by independence hero and national icon Jose Marti. The Cuban vaccine is neither a vector vaccine nor does it work with mRNA technology. The government vaccination program was rolled out in mid-May with Abdala and the second homegrown vaccine, Soberana 2, even before the completion of the third phase of clinical trials.

> If I were a country relying heavily on Sinovac or Astra Zeneca, I'd be pretty interested in seeing the data from Cuba.

## Gottlieb says parts of U.S. could see "very dense outbreaks" as Delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gottlieb-covid-19-delta-variant-face-the-nation/):

> Washington - As the U.S. continues to navigate its way through the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said areas of the country could experience "Very dense outbreaks" with the concerning Delta variant continuing to circulate. Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a state where hospital admissions are up 30%, expressed concern about the Delta COVID-19 variant and low vaccination rates in his state. "The Delta variant is a great concern to us. We see that impacting our increasing cases and hospitalizations," Hutchinson said on "Face the Nation." The governor also noted that vaccine hesitancy is high in his state, which he attributed to conspiracy theories, the pause in Johnson & Johnson's one-shot regimen in April and individuals simply not believing in the efficacy of the virus.

> As someone who just got post viral fatigue last May 2020 and is still struggling with it: I’ve been on both subs (CFS, and covidlonghaulers), and the symptoms are both pretty much exactly the same. 
> 
> I really hope it gets more attention because it’s awful. It feels like an invisible illness. You seem fine to everyone around you, but inside you feel both mentally and physically exhausted and disoriented, leaving most unable to work. 
> 
> Unfortunately unemployment is only for those healthy and able to work. And it’s pretty much impossible to be eligible for disability from post viral fatigue syndrome. 
> 
> So you either have to lie and say you’re healthy enough to work to claim unemployment, or tell the truth and just lay in bed unable to do anything and unable to pay your bills.

## Is coronavirus back in Israel? Health experts explain

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/is-the-virus-striking-back-israels-top-10-covid-questions-671982):

> On the one hand, health officials continue to say that these outbreaks are expected, and that because Israel is largely vaccinated with a shot that works against the new Delta variant, the country should not enter another health crisis. The Delta variant is of concern because it is much more contagious than the original virus. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been found to be only around 60% effective in protecting against getting symptomatic cases of COVID following exposure to the Delta variant, and 92% effective at preventing hospitalization.

`/u/zogo13` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8yp76/is_coronavirus_back_in_israel_health_experts/):

> I wanted to post this here because I am seeing wide spread misinformation on this sub, often from a select few individuals using small, misrepresented pieces of data to push doomsday scenario or insidiously anti-Vax narratives.
> 
> Example, 50% of infected in Israel are infected and fully vaccinated.
> 
> According to Public Health Services head Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, as of Wednesday night some 891 people had been diagnosed with coronavirus in the last month, 50% of whom were fully vaccinated. Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy further clarified that the last 99 infected people over the age of 16 had been fully vaccinated and 39 had not.

> Latest PHE data showing protection against hospitalization being *higher* against Delta than Alpha, and efficacy against symptomatic infection being 79% *including both AZ (which has lower efficacy) and Pfizer/Moderna vaccines*

> 
> Vaccines remain highly effective against Delta. If you are vaccinated, it is not a concern for you. This is the opinion of every reasonable public health expert as well, and it’s supported by robust data. It would be great if misinformation surrounding this would stop on this sub.
> 
> EDIT: I even forgot to include the PHE data showing 88% efficacy for the Pfizer vaccine against symptomatic infection.
