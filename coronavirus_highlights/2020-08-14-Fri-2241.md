> While the world watches and waits for a COVID-19 vaccine to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control, there's another inoculation poised to be just as important this fall. CDC director Robert Redfield warned in a WebMD interview on Wednesday that America is bracing for "The worst fall, from a public health perspective, we've ever had.". While the CDC normally purchases about 500,000 doses of the vaccine each year for uninsured adults, this year Redfield said that it's ordered an extra 10 million doses, for more than 190 million doses total, to encourage everyone to get vaccinated against the flu.

> Anthony Fauci told PBS NewsHour on Thursday that he expects the U.S. could "Be as good [as] back to normal as we possibly can" by the end of 2021 if a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available. Fauci said last week that there are "Not great" chances that an eventual vaccine will be 98% effective, arguing instead that the vaccine would likely reduce a person's risk of infection by 50% or 60%.The FDA says it will only require a 50% effectiveness rate for approval. "You've got to think of the vaccine as a tool to be able to get the pandemic to no longer be a pandemic, but to be something that's well controlled," Fauci added.
