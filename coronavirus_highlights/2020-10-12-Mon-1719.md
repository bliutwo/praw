Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/10/12/us-covid-deaths-75-k-more-americans-died-than-previously-recorded-excess-deaths/5935813002/):

> The coronavirus pandemic may have caused tens of thousands of more deaths in the spring and summer than previously thought, a new study says. Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond found nearly 75,000 more people may have died from the pandemic than what was recorded in March to July, according to the report published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA.By examining death certificates, the study found more than 150,000 deaths were officially attributed to COVID-19 during that period. Delayed care, fear of seeking care or emotional crises stemming from the pandemic could have also contributed to these deaths, he says, as well as inaccurate death certificates that may have misidentified a COVID-19 death.
