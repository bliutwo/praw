## Scientists outraged by White House appointees' meddling with coronavirus information: 'Outright egregious'

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/09/13/covid-scientists-white-house-meddling-cdc-mmwr/5787230002/):

> Scientists and physicians reacted with words such as "Aghast," "Despicable" and "Outrageous" over the weekend as news spread that White House appointees interfered with a basic national public health report when it conflicted with President Donald Trump's coronavirus messaging. Jeff Niederdeppe, another member of the MMWR editorial board and a professor of public health communications at Cornell University, said he's concerned political meddling - as described by media reports - could erode public faith and cause long-term damage to the publication. The MMWR predates the CDC itself, having begun as a publication of the U.S. Public Health Service in 1878.Kates said she was disturbed by what appears to be the insertion of politics into a well-respected scientific journal.

> This is going to affect the credibility of American institutions like the FDA and CDC. In fact, we should be taking whatever that is coming out of the FDA and CDC with a grain of salt. If the European FDA and CDC equivalents are not saying the same thing as we are, I would go with the Europeans.

> It feels like India is just insanely fucked in this situation.  They're pushing 100k/day with nothing but exponential spread since like May.  Like [look at their curve](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/) it's like something out of a math textbook under "exponential growth".    And they've got practically a billion and a half people for it to rip through.  And their per capita testing is still super low.  It's going to get really tragic over there.
