## US Reports More COVID-19 Cases In The Last Two Weeks Than It Did For All Of June

Summary of [original article](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/07/23/us-more-covid-19-cases-two-weeks-all-of-june/):

> In the past two weeks, the US recorded more than 915,000 new cases of coronavirus - that's more than the cases reported across the country for the entire month of June. The surge in new cases across the South and Southwest has now been linked back to Americans' travel around Memorial Day and reopenings, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday. Louisiana, where the governor said earlier this month progress made in June against the virus was wiped out in weeks, is set to join at least 11 other states who have reported a total of more than 100,000 infections.

> I really wish more parents would understand that we’re still dealing with a new and novel virus, and that children are still being infected, and while they seem to exhibit different symptoms and have different fatality rates, they do still have symptoms and complications and can in fact die from this. 
> 
> Obviously not everyone has the luxury or ability to be a let to remain isolated indefinitely, but the number of parents who actively let their kids roam free and play with friends and go to camps etc right now and justify it by saying “kids don’t get sick” is astounding.

> Instead of looking forward to a wedding, one Spokane family is now planning a funeral after a young woman died as a result of COVID-19-related symptoms. She went unconscious the next day before her family realized how serious the situation was and could get her to an ER. "We are in absolute shock as she had only experienced mild symptoms as a young, vibrant 25-year-old who was busy planning her wedding," the statement said. "On behalf of the family of Aliyah Marsh".

> > "On behalf of the family of Aliyah Marsh
> 
> > Our precious Aliyah (Alli) Marsh passed away suddenly in her home from symptoms associated with Covid-19 at 3 p.m. Tuesday, July 21 after the valiant efforts by paramedics to do everything they could to resuscitate her. Alli and her fiancé, Adam, were nearing the end of their quarantine when she began to experience difficulty breathing overnight, and then went unconscious the next day before we realized how serious the situation was and could get her to the ER. We are in absolute shock as she had only experienced mild symptoms as a young, vibrant 25-year-old who was busy planning her wedding —losing her to this illness and preparing to bury her was not something we could have ever imagined.
> 
> > For all of you who love Alli like we do, we are so sorry. We are sorry for this community, who has lost a true treasure … a young woman with a smile and a spark that could light up any darkness.
> 
> > We are not seeking sympathy, we are simply hoping that you will use our experience to your own benefit. Maybe, like us, you didn’t really know what Covid-19 was capable of. Now that you know, the question is simply what you are going to do to protect yourselves and your families. We understand that certain preventative measures are not realistic for everyone as we all need to work, but please please take this opportunity to do whatever you can do to prevent this from happening to your family or others. We can no longer act like we don’t really know what this virus can do.
> 
> > Thank you for the outpouring of support and love for our family. We are blessed by every bit of love and comfort so many of you have offered."
> 
> Damn.

## Chick-Fil-A leads Colorado fast food joints in COVID-19 outbreaks, and it isn’t even close

Summary of [original article](https://kdvr.com/news/local/chick-fil-a-leads-colorado-fast-food-joints-in-covid-19-outbreaks-and-it-isnt-even-close/):

> ARVADA, Colo. - At least 28 employees at Chick-Fil-A restaurants across Colorado have tested positive for COVID-19, with 19 more considered probable as of Wednesday. To date, COVID-19 outbreaks have been confirmed at 13 fast food restaurants in Colorado. Hlavacek says for the most part, restaurants in Tri-County have done a good job avoiding outbreaks.

`/u/MyLifesParody` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hwh84z/chickfila_leads_colorado_fast_food_joints_in/):

> It’s because they have 6 people still crammed in that tiny drive thru window. They aren’t social distancing.

## Nearly Two Thirds of Texans Say That COVID-19 Is “Out of Control”

Summary of [original article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/poll-texans-greg-abbott-coronavirus/):

> It's a view held by people in virtually every part of the state-68 percent of Texans in urban areas, and 59 percent of rural Texans. Though the partisan gap is evident-36 percent of Republicans agree that the coronavirus is out of control, compared with 71 percent of independents and a staggering 95 percent of Democrats-there's reason to believe that partisanship plays a smaller role when the question is framed in less dire terms. Based on the attention that anti-shutdown protests received in the spring, it's fair to wonder whether Abbott's slipping approval rating is coming from the right, as well as the left-is he losing ground among those who believe he's acted with too heavy a hand? The polling doesn't really bear that out: 52 percent of Texans thought that he moved "Too quickly" in easing public safety measures, while only 13 percent of respondents said he acted too slowly in rolling back shutdown orders and reopening businesses.

`/u/forreddituseonly` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hwiwy1/nearly_two_thirds_of_texans_say_that_covid19_is/):

> One striking result from the poll reported on here: 80% of Texans approve of the statewide mask mandate.  Even in Texas, anti-mask sentiment is becoming a fringe view.
