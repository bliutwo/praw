## A School Reopens, and the Coronavirus Creeps In — as more schools abandon plans for in-person classes, one that opened in Indiana this week had to quarantine students within hours.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/us/schools-reopening-indiana-coronavirus.html):

> Aug. 1, 2020, 3:00 a.m. ET.One of the first school districts in the country to reopen its doors during the coronavirus pandemic did not even make it a day before being forced to grapple with the issue facing every system actively trying to get students into classrooms: What happens when someone comes to school infected? In California, where schools in two-thirds of the state have been barred from reopening in person for now, state guidelines call for a school to close for at least 14 days if more than 5 percent of its students, faculty and staff test positive over a two-week period. The Greenfield-Central Community School Corporation, with eight schools and 4,400 students, gave families the option of in-person or remote learning.

> > Just hours into the first day of classes on Thursday, a call from the county health department notified Greenfield Central Junior High School in Indiana that a student who had walked the halls and sat in various classrooms had tested positive for the coronavirus.
> 
> > “We knew it was a when, not if,” said Harold E. Olin, superintendent of the Greenfield-Central Community School Corporation, but were “very shocked it was on Day 1.”
> 
> I'm shocked that Superintendent Harold is shocked. Indiana has 969.3 cases per 100,000 which is close to 1% of the population. Means if the school has 500 students/staff probably at least 5 cases. Sunbelt states even worse:
> > 
> > A New York Times analysis found that in many districts in the Sun Belt, at least 10 people infected with the coronavirus would be expected to arrive at a school of about 500 students and staff members during the first week if it reopened today.
> 
> And now this means the entire class of students have to quarantine for 14 days, so miss out on the next 2 weeks of school. 
> 
> > Administrators began an emergency protocol, isolating the student and ordering everyone who had come into close contact with the person, including other students, to quarantine for 14 days.
> 
> So first day back in school and the entire class is home for another 14 days.

> *Pikachu shocked face*

> Edit: yeah, no matter how you cut it, confining a group of student even as high as twenty into a single room, with a single teacher, is just asking for widespread infection and possible death. Not to mention the long-term devastation this virus is seeming to cause already. Imagine that within an entire generation of youth - inside a country with privatized Healthcare. Now it starts to look really scary, huh?
