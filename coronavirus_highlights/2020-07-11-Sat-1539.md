> New research provides evidence that working memory and fluid intelligence are associated with engaging in social distancing in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. "At the moment, successful containment of the COVID-19 outbreak critically relies on people's voluntary compliance with social distancing guidelines. However, there is widespread non-compliance in our society, especially during the early stage of this pandemic," said study author Weiwei Zhang, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. "Our findings reveal a novel cognitive root of social distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic," Zhang said.

Meanwhile in the US, we have a giant toddler with the attention span of a goldfish throwing temper tantrums on twitter running our response.  Strange how we're heading towards 100K cases and thousands of deaths a day.

## Bill Gates calls for COVID-19 meds to go to people who need them, not 'highest bidder'

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-meeting-gates/bill-gates-calls-for-covid-19-meds-to-go-to-people-who-need-them-not-highest-bidder-idUSKCN24C09R):

> Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates called for COVID-19 drugs and an eventual vaccine to be made available to countries and people that need them most, not to the "Highest bidder," saying relying on market forces would prolong the deadly pandemic. "If we just let drugs and vaccines go to the highest bidder, instead of to the people and the places where they are most needed, we'll have a longer, more unjust, deadlier pandemic," Gates, a founder of Microsoft, said in a video released on Saturday during a virtual COVID-19 conference organized by the International AIDS Society. Gates said efforts begun two decades ago to battle the global HIV/AIDS crisis, when countries came together to eventually make medicines available in most of the world including Africa, can serve as a model for making COVID-19 medicines widely accessible.
