## 'Healing Is Coming': U.S. Starts Vaccinating People Against COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/14/946232462/incredibly-hopeful-u-s-starts-vaccinating-people-against-covid-19):

> Updated at 1 p.m. ET. The first people in the U.S. are receiving vaccination shots against COVID-19 on Monday, as U.S. health workers started administering the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The vaccine's arrival is a rare bright spot in the fight against a viral disease that has now killed nearly 300,000 people in the U.S. and more than 1.6 million people worldwide. The first vaccine doses are earmarked for the elderly, front-line workers and people with health conditions that increase their risk.

> I wish they accompanied stories like this with some sort of percentage bar to show how many vaccines have been administered vs how many are needed to hit herd immunity.  
> 
> I fear people are going to take false comfort in the start of this process when it's going to take months and months to actually complete. While it's definitely good news, this is hardly the time to start relaxing.

## Belgian police break up 52 person orgy in a house next door to a Covid clinic

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/covid-belgium-clinic-sex-orgy-b1773723.html):

> Belgian police this weekend broke up a 52-person sex party at a house in front of a Covid clinic, just two weeks after an all-male orgy in Brussels ended the career of an anti-gay Hungarian MEP. Police raided a 28th birthday party in the early of Sunday in the Ardennes town of Saint-Mard in the south-east corner of the country, just two miles from the border with France. "I'm angry. Some people really don't respect anything! Organizing an illegal party in the middle of the night in front of a clinic where Covid patients are treated? This is unacceptable!". Two weeks ago, anti-gay Hungarian MEP Jozsef Szajer was caught climbing out of a window naked after police raided a sex party in Brussels involving 25 men.

## Kizzmekia Corbett, an African American woman, is praised as key scientist behind COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kizzmekia-corbett-african-american-woman-praised-key-scientist/story?id=74679965):

> "The very vaccine that's one of the two that has absolutely exquisite levels - 94 to 95% efficacy against clinical disease and almost 100% efficacy against serious disease that are shown to be clearly safe - that vaccine was actually developed in my institute's vaccine research center by a team of scientists led by Dr. Barney Graham and his close colleague, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, or Kizzy Corbett," Fauci told the forum. Corbett is part of a team at NIH that worked with Moderna, the pharmaceutical company that developed one of the two mRNA vaccines that has shown to be more than 90% effective. Fauci said Corbett's role as one of the scientists behind the vaccines should be a sign of hope for Black Americans who are hesitant to trust the vaccine.
