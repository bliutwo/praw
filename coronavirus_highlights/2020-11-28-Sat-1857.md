## U.S. hospitalizations top 90,000 for the first time

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-hospitalizations-top-90000-united-states/):

> On Thanksgiving Day, hospitalizations hit a record high of more than 90,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project, and about 50 Americans are now dying every hour. The true case count could be much higher, considering an expected dip in positivity rates linked to a surge in pre-holiday testing. "A lot of people flooded into testing programs to get tested before they traveled for Thanksgiving," said Dr. Emily Landon of the University of Chicago Medical Center, adding, "But they do bring the positivity rates down by flooding the testing market with a number of low risk individuals."

## Should you quarantine after Thanksgiving gathering amid rising COVID cases? Yes, expert says

Summary of [original article](https://6abc.com/thanksgiving-covid-coronavirus-cases-quarantine/8332591/):

> Anyone who traveled to another part of the country and got together with other people could be at risk for contracting COVID-19. How many guests were there and what were their risks? If you visited elderly parents who have been quarantining themselves, that's very low risk to you. If you got together with others who have risk themselves, know that you are now at risk, too.

## They had coronavirus. Now they’re showing up at memory clinics with serious cognitive loss

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/11/they-had-coronavirus-now-theyre-showing-up-at-memory-clinics-with-serious-cognitive-loss.html):

> The journal Neurology Today is reporting hundreds of COVID-19 "Long-haulers" being treated for cognitive problems at specialty clinics set up in areas hardest hit by the virus. Rondeau, who founded the Montclair Memory Clinic in 2001, had seen instances in the past where a virus similar to COVID-19 led to perplexing cognitive loss in a person who had no previous memory issues. That's what leaves Rondeau and other experts concerned about the cognitive issues now being seen in people who have survived coronavirus.

> A fellow doctor that I treated as a patient of mine lost most of his memory and will probably never work as a doctor ever again. He is in neurological therapy but there is only so much you can do against hundreds of ministrokes.

## Alito Slaps Down Megachurch Pastor’s Lawsuit That Claimed Obeying God Meant Ignoring COVID-19 Orders

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/covid-19-pandemic/samuel-alito-shuts-down-megachurch-pastor-tony-spell-lawsuit-that-claimed-obeying-god-meant-ignoring-covid-19-orders-roy-moore/):

> Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito flatly rejected a plea by a Louisiana megachurch pastor to keep his church fully open against orders from the government to limit the size of worship gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The application, styled as Spell v. Edwards, complained that the orders by Gov. John Bel Edwards forbade the Life Tabernacle Church from being "Fully assemble[d]." In a more legally astonishing question, the case also sought to ask whether the "First Amendment give[s] the Church exclusive jurisdiction over whether to assemble or not." In other words, the church sought to have the Supreme Court declare its assembly function as beyond state action or reproach. Not only has Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards refused to respect the First Amendment rights of Pastor Spell and his church, but he has just refused an order of his own legislature to end the state of emergency that purportedly gives him the power to issue emergency orders.
