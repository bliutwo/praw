## Texas first responders who die from COVID-19 denied state benefits

Summary of [original article](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/investigates/texas-first-responders-who-die-from-covid-19-denied-state-benefits/287-4aefc2ed-0e21-48ad-ba63-62266a2e9826):

> Although the Texas Department of Criminal Justice reported Johnson's death as being in the line of duty, the state Office of Risk Management has denied his family's workers' compensation claim. Besides making sure workers' compensation covers a pandemic, they also are seeking a change in the law to ensure that first responders' families are eligible for line-of-duty death benefits when they die of COVID-19. By law, families of first responders who die in the line of duty are eligible for a $500,000 lump sum payment, state-paid funeral expenses, and other benefits.

> 
> >In a letter denying the claim, the agency said it was “currently unable to accept this claim as a compensable injury that occurred in the course and scope of employment.” Johnson’s widow is appealing the denial. 
> 
> This sounds sort of similar to how all disability claims are initially denied to try and get people to give up and go away.  This is the sort of thing that lawyers will eventually sort out.  It is just incredibly infuriating that this grieving family will have to jump through hoops to get what they are due.

## Fauci says herd immunity possible "reasonably quickly" if enough Americans take vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-fauci-vaccine-herd-immunity-face-the-nation-2020-11-22/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&utm_content=algorithm):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said Sunday the U.S. could reach herd immunity against the coronavirus "Reasonably quickly" next year if enough Americans get vaccinated. Appearing on "Face the Nation," Fauci said "Help is on the way" in the form of the vaccine, but Americans need to exercise caution as the holidays approach and take steps to mitigate the spread of the virus through the winter, saying the country is in a "Very, very difficult situation" as cases continue to rise. Vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna have been shown to be highly effective, but Fauci said herd immunity - the threshold at which enough people have been vaccinated or infected by the virus to curtail its spread - can't be achieved if only 40% or 50% of the population receives the vaccine, Fauci said.

`/u/Ecwfrk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jz4y39/fauci_says_herd_immunity_possible_reasonably/):

> Anti vaccine sentiment shouldn't be too bad outside the hardcore pre-covid antivax crowd.
> 
> Political resistance to acknowledgment of the virus' existence and severity bizarrely somehow doesn't preclude acknowledgement that getting a vaccine for it as soon as possible is vitally important to bring back full 'normalcy'.
> 
> As soon as distribution begins, I've a feeling the most resistive to social precautions will be clammoring to be first in line to get a vaccine as they'll perceive it as an instant gateway back to a lifestyle they can't handle being severed from enjoying freely.
> 
> The hardest thing will be ensuring everyone gets *both* doses. Many are going to feel "one should be good enough", especially if they experience any side effects with the first dose.
