## The unvaccinated are at risk as evolution accelerates the covid-19 pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/07/03/the-new-variants-of-sars-cov-2-are-much-more-dangerous-to-the-unvaccinated):

> Spikes for speedy spreadOther things may not be equal; the danger posed to the unvaccinated by a new variant may not be exactly the same as that posed by older versions. How did these variants come to have so many mutations in the first place? Mutations are normally expected to crop up one at a time; but the named variants each emerged with a whole set of them. Seeing similar mutations crop up in different variants also suggests that evolution is sampling a somewhat limited number of possibilities.

> The beginning of the article highlights an important point: for the first year of the pandemic, mutations of the virus were quite uninteresting. It wasn't until that when the mutations kicked into a higher gear.

## Face masks to become a personal choice in England, minister says

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-covid-19-data-looks-very-positive-lifting-lockdown-minister-says-2021-07-04/):

> LONDON, July 4 - The wearing of face coverings in England will become a personal choice and the data that will determine if lockdown restrictions can be lifted this month was looking "Very positive", Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Sunday. "It will be a different period where we as private citizens make these judgments rather than the government telling you what to do," Jenrick told Sky News.Legal lockdown restrictions are due to be removed on July 19 under the government's roadmap and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out details about the final stage of easing in England in the coming days, Jenrick said. "It does seem as if we can now move forward and move to a much more permissive regime where we move away from many of those restrictions that have been so difficult for us," he said.

> It always has been. I don't care anymore since me and mine are all vaxxed up but i will never in a million years understand why ordinances weren't enforced during the height of this thing. Any other time the government is happy enough to hand out a ticket, money grab. But with anti-maskers it was all hands off. Can't dare upset those delicate little flowers. Hey Covid deniers - Can you please go smoke pot in public places because it would set a precedence not to enforce that law as well.
