## Feds tell Florida superintendents money is there if state blocks pay over mask mandates

Summary of [original article](https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/education/2021/08/13/feds-tell-florida-superintendents-money-there-if-state-blocks-pay/8131379002/):

> In a letter dated Friday, Aug. 13, Miguel Cardona, secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, said he had notified DeSantis that local school districts may use federal COVID-19 relief funds to make up for any action the state of Florida may make to withhold pay from superintendents and school board members in response to classroom mask mandates. Alachua County Public Schools and several other Florida school districts have required students to start the school year wearing masks as a safety measure against COVID-19, consistent with guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The letter was first delivered to Michele White, director of the Florida Association of School Administrators, and forwarded to local school districts late Friday afternoon.

## US could see 200,000 Covid cases a day again: ‘Unvaccinated are sitting ducks’

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/15/us-covid-delta-cases-unvaccinated-sitting-ducks):

> The US could soon see Covid-19 cases return to 200,000 a day, a level not seen since among the pandemic's worst days in January and February, the director of the National Institutes of Health warned on Sunday. No US decision has been made because cases here so far still indicate that people remain highly protected from Covid-19, including the Delta variant, after receiving the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna regimen or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. "But here we are with the Delta variant, which is so contagious, and this heartbreaking situation where 90 million people are still unvaccinated who are sitting ducks for this virus, and that's the mess we're in. We're in a world of hurt."

`/u/scrotum_pot_pie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/p53g2h/us_could_see_200000_covid_cases_a_day_again/):

> I think a lot of extroverts are going to have mental health struggles from the whiplash of the CDC dropping mask mandates and the Delta surge.
> 
> A lot of my family is in the “I can’t even with Covid anymore” mindset. My employer is doing everything they can to get us back in the office.
> 
> The cognitive dissonance, even in highly vaccinated areas, is going to be intense in the coming months.

> The expectations and pressure placed on parents this last couple of years has just been crazy.
> 
> Hey parents, did you plan to raise your children in the context of a society that provides schooling and daycare options?! Well, SURPRISE, the parts of society that were most helpful to you have collapsed!  Now you are solely responsible for providing all care and schooling for your children, but WAIT THERE’S MORE, because you *still* have to do your regular full time jobs as well!  Prepare yourself for the long term sensation of simultaneously failing at multiple tasks!  Also, did you think you would at least have family help and support? Well, SURPRISE AGAIN, because your children could literally kill their grandparents, so waive goodbye for more than a year.  Now you are the *only* social interaction for your confused and lonely children.  Try to fit in video chats when you can, in between schooling full time and working full time.
> 
> Also, on top of everything, there's still all the fear and axiety associated with knowing your children could be exposed to an unknown and new virus.
> 
> It's funny that people thought COVID would lead to a baby boom.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see a long term dip in birthrates from this, even moreso than the already downward trend.
