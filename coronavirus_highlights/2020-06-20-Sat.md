## Michigan is on track for COVID-19 containment, northern Michigan looks even better

Summary of [original article](https://www.interlochenpublicradio.org/post/michigan-track-covid-19-containment-northern-michigan-looks-even-better):

> Across the state, new infections and deaths are rapidly decreasing so much that the website COVID Act Now indicated this week Michigan has low COVID-19 risk and is on track to contain the disease. With increased testing of asymptomatic people results can give the county a better picture of how the virus is or is not spreading. Northwest Michigan Health Services, a health care provider in the region, has run 1,485 tests in Traverse City, with 80% of those tested showing no symptoms.

> Serious question - does it matter at all what measures a state takes if there is free travel between states? Like if one state does everything right, contains the virus, and slowly starts opening again, but then a bunch of people next door drive over and infect everyone, aren’t they just back to square one?

## Florida’s Covid-19 surge shows the state's reopening plan is not working

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/20/florida-covid19-surge-reopening-governor-desantis-coronavirus):

> "His policies are simply not working and he's recklessly reopening Florida despite the data screaming for caution. Refusing to acknowledge the alarming patterns in cases, hospitalizations and positivity is not only arrogant but will cost lives, public health and our economy," Fried added. The spike in Florida's figures, with close to 90,000 cases and deaths surpassing 3,000, comes as the majority of its 67 counties reach the end of the second week of DeSantis' "Safe, smart, step-by-step" reopening plan. Carol Dover, president and chief executive of the Florida restaurant and lodging association, said she remained "Guarded" about the immediate future of the state's $67bn tourism industry, even though numbers since the reopening "Are still going in the right direction".

> So opening everything with complete disregard for science and medical advice is a bad idea, no way.

## Trump says he asked for coronavirus testing to be slowed down because there were so many cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-rally-speech-tonight-coronavirus-testing-tulsa-covid-19-a9577576.html):

> Donald Trump has told supporters at his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that he asked for the rate of coronavirus testing to be slowed down because there were so many positive cases being found in the United States. "Here's the bad part: when you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people, slow the testing down please." Worldwide there have been 8.9 million cases and 466,000 deaths.

> This is real folks. If you ever want to see a divided country, you’re looking at it in real time.  The president is telling people this virus doesn’t exist and if we don’t test, it’s not here.  The other side is wearing masks and trying to go about life safely but can’t accomplish it because of the unsafe side.  Total shit show and it’s happening during one of the worst pandemics in history.

> In the DC suburbs where I am (Maryland), even a lot of the solo drivers I see are wearing masks. Went for a drive to rural Virginia this weekend, was greeted in one town I drove through by a pack of at least 350 maskless residents - they were having high school graduation in the city square.
