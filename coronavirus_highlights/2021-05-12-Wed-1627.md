## Covid pandemic was preventable, says WHO-commissioned report

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/12/covid-pandemic-was-preventable-says-who-commissioned-report):

> The Covid pandemic was a preventable disaster that need not have cost millions of lives if the world had reacted more quickly, according to an independent high-level panel, which castigates global leaders and calls for major changes to bring it to an end and ensure it cannot happen again. "There are many reviews of previous health crises that include sensible recommendations. Yet, they sit gathering dust in UN basements and on government shelves Our report shows that most countries of the world were simply not prepared for a pandemic." The report was commissioned by the WHO director general at the instigation of member states, who called at the World Health Assembly in May last year for an impartial review of what happened and what could be learned from the pandemic.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/pfizer-covid-vaccine-cdc-panel-endorses-for-use-in-kids-12-to-15.html):

> Though more experts now say herd immunity is looking increasingly unlikely as variants spread. As of Tuesday, more than 150 million Americans age 18 and older have received at least one dose, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 115 million American adults are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. About 13% of adults say they definitely won't get a vaccine while 21% say they will "Wait and see" or will get one only if required, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. CDC official Dr. Megan Wallace said Wednesday serious adverse events were more common among vaccine than placebo participants, 0.4% vs 0.2%, but none of them were attributed to the shots. More serious side effects were more common in the vaccine group, with about 11% reporting things like pain at the injection site that prevented daily activity, severe fever, headache or muscle pain.
