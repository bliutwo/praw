## New Zealand considers permanent quarantine facility, dismisses UK's decision to 'live with Covid'

Summary of [original article](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/125662926/covid19-government-considers-permanent-miq-facility-dismisses-uks-decision-to-live-with-covid):

> "We are likely to see more incremental change, [rather] than dramatic change where we wake up one morning and say, 'We just go back to the way things were before Covid-19.'."One of the things that [the] UK Government have been very clear about [is] that there will be a spike in cases, potentially thousands of cases a day; there will be more people dying ... That's not something that we have been willing to accept in New Zealand. "There's lots of things that we have to weigh up here. One of which is that we could get relatively on top of Covid-19 - the world could start to get on top of Covid-19 for a period - and then we could find that there are new variants that flare it all up again." National Party Covid-19 response spokesman Chris Bishop said his party had wanted the Government to start building purpose-built facilities back in February.

> The general idea is that in future there will be a traffic light system with red, amber and green countries based on their Covid infection rates at any given time, or the presence of new variants.  Once NZ has high levels of vaccination Green countries will likely be allowed in without any quarantine and amber countries might require a shorter quarantine until a negative test is delivered, or at home quarantine.  
> 
> But there are still likely to be many red countries and they may change regularly with seasons and variants.  People arriving from these countries will likely still need to quarantine, and prehaps even the unvaccinated will be allowed in with the full 2 week quarantine.  That's the situation likely to still exist for another 3-5 years.  
> 
> NZ has not yet decided what strategy we will follow once the vaccination campaign is done.  It may be mitigation as used for flu, or it may be elimination, as used for measles.  Neither strategy would involve lockdowns or total border closure as today.  Elimination would require some border measures as I described above, along with contact tracing, quarantining of positive cases and close contacts.

## mRNA Vaccines Slash Risk of COVID-19 Infection by 91 Percent in Fully Vaccinated People

Summary of [original article](https://healthcare.utah.edu/publicaffairs/news/2021/07/7-yoon-covid-vaccine.php#:~:text=People%20who%20receive%20mRNA%20COVID,sites%2C%20including%20Salt%20Lake%20City.):

> People who receive mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are up to 91 percent less likely to develop the disease than those who are unvaccinated, according to a new nationwide study of eight sites, including Salt Lake City. For those few vaccinated people who do still get an infection, or "Breakthrough" cases, the study suggests that vaccines reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and shorten its duration. The RECOVER study is ongoing, and results from future phases will help determine how long COVID-19 vaccines protect against infection and the real-world effectiveness of newer vaccines.
