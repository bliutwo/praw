Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/covid-dr-fauci-says-it-appears-outbreak-in-minks-wont-be-a-problem-for-vaccines.html):

> The White House coronavirus advisor, who has worked as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 36 years, said the institute's vaccine research center had taken "a first look" at the discovery of a new coronavirus strain on Danish mink farms. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a press conference on Nov. 4 that health authorities had discovered virus strains in humans and in mink that showed decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the effectiveness of future vaccines. The prime minister swiftly ordered a cull of the mink population in Denmark, one of the world's main mink fur exporters.

> > For many health-care workers, the toll of the pandemic goes beyond physical exhaustion. COVID-19 has eaten away at the emotional core of their work. “To be a nurse, you really have to care about people,” Neville said. But when an ICU is packed with COVID-19 patients, most of whom are likely to die, “to protect yourself, you just shut down. You get to the point when you realize that you’ve become a machine. There’s only so many bags you can zip.”

## ‘Crisis Levels’ in Mississippi: No ICU Beds Left in Jackson, Only 12% Remain Statewide

Summary of [original article](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/6883/crisis-levels-in-mississippi-no-icu-beds-left-in-jackson-only-12-remain-statewide/):

> There is still no statewide mask mandate; Gov. Tate Reeves allowed it to expire on Sept. 30 after the state successfully beat back the summer wave-a decision Dobbs had shown discomfort with at the time. Jackson is not the only large Mississippi city with no or few ICU beds available. There are zero ICU beds available in Southaven and just one in nearby Olive Branch, both located in DeSoto County, where the sheriff is refusing to enforce mask and social distancing orders.

`/u/72184` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jthcu4/crisis_levels_in_mississippi_no_icu_beds_left_in/):

> > After two months of sustained improvement, though, the governor allowed the statewide mask mandate to expire on Sept. 30, saying “we need to trust the people of this country to look after themselves and make wise decisions” instead of the government. 
> 
> I don't trust people in traffic to use their turn signals when they're supposed to. All you have to do is drive through any City or town or spend a little bit of time on the interstate to realize how stupid and selfish and irresponsible the average person is. I just can't wrap my mind around their unrealistic expectation of the average person's common sense.
