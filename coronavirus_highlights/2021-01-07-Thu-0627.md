## Israel is vaccinating so fast itâ€™s running out of vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israel-vaccinates-the-most-people/2021/01/04/23b20882-4e73-11eb-a1f5-fdaf28cfca90_story.html):

> At least one shipment of a million doses of the Moderna vaccine will arrive in Israel in early January, rather than in March as was originally planned, according to Israel's Channel 12 News. Israel's vaccine success is made possible by its small size and the efficiencies of its nationalized health system, in which all 9 million citizens hold identity cards and register their electronic medical files with one of the country's four national HMOs.Israel also maintains a national vaccination registry, first designed for childhood vaccinations, that will be used in the coming weeks to monitor immediate and long-term progress of the coronavirus vaccine program. Pfizer, which has a strong presence in the country and an intimate understanding of its universal health-care system, views Israel as a "Test case," said Ran Nir-Paz, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, "a kind of proof of concept to show that the vaccines work."

## Dr. Anthony Fauci thinks UK COVID variant more widespread in US than known

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/anthony-fauci-u-k-covid-variant-more-widespread-u-s-1559215):

> The new, more infectious variant of COVID that has emerged from the U.K. is likely in more U.S. states than currently known, Anthony Fauci. A top immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Newsweek on Tuesday he would be "Very surprised" if the U.K. variant was not in "Several more states" and "More widespread in the United States than we are currently detecting it to be." "We take that very seriously. Because if you have greater transmissibility., you will get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalizations. And when you get more hospitalizations, you ultimately wind up getting more deaths."

`/u/corrupt_mischief` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/krpe4d/dr_anthony_fauci_thinks_uk_covid_variant_more/):

> I'm sure that by the time the UK variant was discovered it had already spread across the globe.
