> Shouldn’t this be a major story? In the last 2 weeks one state has reported 9000 kids infected with the virus? While they just reopened schools. Should be a headline everywhere on the school debate

## C.D.C. Now Says People Without Covid-19 Symptoms Do Not Need Testing | The revision prompted confusion and alarm from experts, who called the move “potentially dangerous.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/health/covid-19-testing-cdc.html):

> Prior iterations of the C.D.C.'s testing guidelines struck a markedly different tone, explicitly stating that "Testing is recommended for all close contacts" of people infected with the coronavirus, regardless of symptoms. The newest version, which was posted on Monday, amended the agency's guidance to say that people who have been in close contact with an infected individual - typically defined as being within six feet of a person with the coronavirus and for at least 15 minutes - "Do not necessarily need a test" if they do not have symptoms. An H.H.S. spokesperson said that asymptomatic testing could still be warranted "When directed by public health leaders or health care providers," and noted that testing decisions should be "Based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.".

`/u/Gayfetus` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ignmyf/cdc_now_says_people_without_covid19_symptoms_do/):

> The headline is missing the most alarming part: **the CDC is recommending against testing for people who have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case**.
> 
> In fact, in their [new guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html), they specifically spell it out:
> 
> > If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms:
> 
> > You do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.
> 
> This *might* make sense if asymptomatic transmission wasn't a thing. But we now know [all too well](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/world/europe/coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic.html) that it is a very relevant factor in the spread of COVID-19.
> 
> But now the CDC is saying that people who have been exposed, i.e. the ones most likely to be carrying SARS-CoV-2 and be infectious with it, should forego testing. This might make a little bit of sense if the CDC is saying anyone in that situation should go into quarantine, but they're not.
> 
> We're no longer under the awful testing crunch the country was in a few weeks ago, so this can't be a matter of rationing tests. Nor would it make a lick of sense to ration tests by withholding it from some of the people who need it the most (which includes people who have been exposed to known COVID-19 cases).
> 
> The COVID-19 experts I've been [following](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1242019425135493121) have been sounding the alarm over this change for several days now.

## New virus cases decline in the US and experts credit masks

Summary of [original article](https://www.ksat.com/health/2020/08/25/new-virus-cases-decline-in-the-us-and-experts-credit-masks/):

> Even at 43,000 new cases per day, the U.S. remains far above the numbers seen during the spring, when new daily cases peaked at about 34,000, he said. The virus is blamed for more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and about 178,000 deaths in the U.S. Worldwide, the death toll is put at more than 810,000, with about 23.7 million cases. Officials at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville said four students are facing disciplinary proceedings after three hosted off-campus parties with no mask or other distancing and another left isolation to meet with others despite testing positive for the virus.

> Man. Earlier I saw a [Bloomberg article](https://www.instagram.com/p/CET1nTtHjfN/) on Instagram. And it has comments upvoted like 200 likes telling people you don't need masks and it's a conspiracy. Social media was a mistake.
