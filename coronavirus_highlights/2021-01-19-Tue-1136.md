## Supermarket chain Aldi to pay U.S. workers who get COVID-19 vaccination

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-aldi-idUSKBN29O1GN):

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - German supermarket chain Aldi on Tuesday became the latest firm in the grocery sector to offer incentives for U.S. employees getting a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it would give up to four hours of pay to those who choose to receive inoculations. Dollar General Corp last week offered frontline employees a similar incentive after they get the vaccine, while grocery delivery company Instacart said it would pay $25 to more than half-a-million gig workers if they chose to take time off to get vaccinated. Aldi said it was working with officials across the United States to get workers priority access to the vaccine, joining other companies including Amazon.com Inc and Uber Technologies Inc lobbying to move workers closer to the front of the line for vaccinations.

## Israeli hospital: 98% of staff who got 2nd shot have high-level COVID antibodies

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-hospital-98-of-staff-who-got-2nd-shot-have-high-level-covid-antibodies/):

> A new serological study conducted at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan has shown 98% of hospital workers who received the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine have developed a high level of antibodies to fight off the virus. The hospital says that a week after receiving the final dose, antibodies jumped to a level between 6 and 20 times higher than that observed after the first shot. Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit at Sheba, says that the initial results indicate the vaccinees are unlikely to be carriers or infectious - a matter that scientists have hitherto not determined - as antibody levels are high enough to suppress any virus particles.

> I wonder which vaccine they got.

## 18-year-old dies with COVID-19, family and girlfriend say he had it twice

Summary of [original article](https://kdvr.com/news/coronavirus/18-year-old-dies-with-covid-19-family-and-girlfriend-say-he-had-it-twice/):

> Portillo's girlfriend and cousin both stated to FOX31 that the teen contracted and tested positive twice for the coronavirus two separate times. Portillo died on Nov. 19 but he went to the doctor on Nov. 18. After first contracting the virus in October, finally feeling better and being COVID free, Ferrel said Portillo thought he was immune at that point from catching the virus again.

`/u/netscorer1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0ijxq/18yearold_dies_with_covid19_family_and_girlfriend/):

> To catch the same virus twice within few weeks? Sounds more like it was the same infection. Antibodies from the first infection would still be plenty to fight off any subsequent infection, let alone to let body succumb to the disease.
