> [Typhoid Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon#Release_and_second_quarantine_\(1915%E2%80%931938\)) spent the last 20 years of her life in quarantine because she refused to stop working as cook and killed dozens. The precedent is there, so these jokers better wise up.

## Couple who insisted on 100 wedding guests are diagnosed with Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/covid-19-wedding-guests-san-francisco-california-coronavirus-a9640996.html):

> A couple who insisted on having 100 guests for their wedding have contracted coronavirus, alongside eight of their friends. As the guests were arriving at the venue, an official from the city showed up and told them that it could not go ahead as planned, because the amount of guests involved violated an executive order in the state. The couple were still able to have a wedding of some kind, but with a majority of the guests watching the service via video-conferencing service Zoom and a select few in the church.

> *"A couple who insisted on having 100 guests for their wedding have contracted coronavirus, alongside eight of their friends.*
> 
> *The wedding, that took place in early July, was held at the SS Peter and Paulâ€™s Church, which overlooks Washington Square Park in San Francisco, California.*
> 
> *The couple* ***also held a rehearsal dinner the night before the event****, which more than 40 guests attended, according to the San Francisco Chronicle."*

> *" As the guests were arriving at the venue, an official from the city showed up and told them that it* ***could not go ahead as planned****, because the amount of guests involved violated an executive order in the state.* 
> 
> *The couple, alongside eight of their guests tested positive for the virus, after they started showing symptoms of Covid-19 within five days of the ceremony.*
> 
> *The guest list at the wedding included* ***people travelling*** *from all over the US, including Texas and Arizona, which have both struggled with the pandemic and recorded record cases in the last six weeks."*
> 
> So 10 people mainly from the rehearsal dinner, would have probably been worse if the Wedding had gone ahead as scheduled.

## Herman Cain still hospitalized more than 3 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/herman-cain-hospitalized-coronavirus-2a52dd12-0cea-4492-a307-9442f29b1543.html):

> Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is still in the hospital undergoing oxygen treatment more than three weeks after first being hospitalized with the coronavirus on July 2, according to an update from his Twitter account on Monday. The big picture: The 74-year-old Cain, co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa in June and did not wear a mask. "We know it's been a few days since we last gave you an update on the boss. But he is still in the hospital being treated with oxygen for his lungs. In the meantime, the doctors say his other organs and systems are strong."Re-strengthening the lungs is a long and slow process, and the doctors want to be thorough about it.

`/u/RichardBLine` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hyzay3/herman_cain_still_hospitalized_more_than_3_weeks/):

> "The big picture: The 74-year-old Cain, co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa in June and did not wear a mask. Two days after he was said to have tested positive, Cain commented on a July 4 celebration at Mt. Rushmore, tweeting: "Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!""
> 
> I bet he's fed up being in a hospital taking oxygen from a machine.  This all could heve been avoided by wearing a mask instead of mocking it.  It's really hard to feel sorry for people like this.
