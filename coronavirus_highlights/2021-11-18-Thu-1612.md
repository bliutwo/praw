> My kids got the fist shot the first weekend our pediatrician had a clinic and it was full of enthusiastic parents yelling encouragement to the other kids there. As time goes by, the crowds coming in will be less enthusiastic to be there. I just wonder where the line is.

## 30% of healthcare workers unvaccinated as of September, CDC study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/30-of-healthcare-workers-remain-unvaccinated-cdc-study-finds.html?origin=BHRE&utm_source=BHRE&utm_medium=email&utm_content=newsletter&oly_enc_id=3125D2636290F2X):

> Thirty percent of healthcare workers in more than 2,000 U.S. hospitals remained unvaccinated against COVID-19 as of Sept. 15, according to an analysis conducted by researchers from the CDC. The analysis, which was published Nov. 18 in the American Journal of Infection Control, examined data from 3.3 million healthcare workers that was voluntarily reported by 2,086 hospitals to the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System on COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Vaccination rates were highest among healthcare workers in children's hospitals and short-term acute care hospitals, according to the analysis. The authors said the CMS emergency regulation that requires vaccination for eligible staff at healthcare facilities that participate in Medicare or Medicaid should substantially boost vaccination among healthcare workers.

> I'd prefer the methodology if they separated by profession rather than hospital type. Because I know vaccination rates amongst doctors is much higher than it is for nurses
