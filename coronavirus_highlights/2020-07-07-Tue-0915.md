> A few, adamant that the coronavirus was a hoax or that deaths in New York were overstated, texted him videos promoting the false internet conspiracy theory that links the spread of the virus to the ultrafast wireless technology known as 5G."I don't know, if I wasn't a nurse, I would've totally believed the videos," he said.

Yes, she would tell them, describing the 18-wheel refrigerated truck that was parked outside Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital in Manhattan and used to store bodies.

A few days later, without taking her to a doctor, her mother would later report that her daughter "Looked gray" on June 19, so she put Carsyn on her grandfather's oxygen machine.
