## White House seeks to discredit Fauci amid coronavirus surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-seeks-discredit-fauci-amid-coronavirus-surge-n1233612):

> A White House official told NBC News that "Several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things." The official provided NBC News with a lengthy list of past comments by Fauci earlier in the pandemic, including Fauci saying in January that coronavirus was "Not a major threat" and "Not driven by asymptomatic carriers" and Fauci's comment in March that "People should not be walking around with masks." Many of the past statements the White House is criticizing Fauci for are ones that were based on the best available data at the time and were widely echoed by Trump, other members of the task force and senior White House officials. The White House official's remark questioning Fauci was first reported by The Washington Post.The attempt to discredit Fauci comes amid signs of growing tensions between Fauci and the president.

## Covid-19 coronavirus: Superspreader - woman infects 71 people in 60 seconds in elevator: CDC study

Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12347495):

> One asymptomatic carrier rode an elevator alone, then 71 people got Covid-19. The CDC study centres on a deep-dive contact tracing effort in Heilongjiang Province, China in mid-April. So once the virus slipped through the cracks, it found easy channels through which to spread. And while the virus found a way to escape social isolation and self-quarantine measures, isolation remains the only tool available to choke its spread. "Continued measures to protect, screen, and isolate infected persons are essential to mitigating and containing the Covid-19 pandemic," the study reads.

> "woman infects 71 people in 60 seconds in elevator"....I assume they mean she infected like ten people in an elevator that then went on to infect others around them and it totaled up to 71 people? Or is this just a giant ass elevator?
