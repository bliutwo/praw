> I just got off the phone with my mom about an hour ago. She's a die-hard conservative in Texas but was very pro-mask at the beginning of the pandemic. She told me today that she and my stepdad are going to the movies tomorrow. I asked her to please wear a mask and she started spewing every right-wing nonsense Fox News and OANN teach their base. Anyways, it resulted in her saying she doesn't need to wear one because our home city is "fine." 
> 
> I asked her if she'd wear a mask if Trump or the governor made them wear one and she paused, eventually saying, "Yeah, I guess." Well mom, now you get to wear a mask.

Summary of [original article](https://www.mediaite.com/radio/dr-fauci-coronavirus-was-allowed-to-perpetuate-in-the-u-s-because-only-about-50-percent-of-the-country-locked-down/):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States is facing a resurgence of the coronavirus because the country didn't take lockdowns far enough during the first wave of the pandemic. "What we've seen over the last several days is a spike in cases that are way beyond the worst spikes that we've seen," Fauci said. "In the United States," Fauci said, "Even in the most strict lockdown, only about 50 percent of the country locked down."

> >“You’ve been losing this battle, haven’t you?” the BBC host asked Fauci regarding that sentiment.
> 
> >“Admittedly yes, we have,” Fauci said. “We cannot give up because it appears that we’re losing the battle.”
> 
> I agree we can't give up but with 50,000 cases a day and a complete lack of a federal track and trace program it seems we already have given up. At this point it is hard to imagine how we can ever get this back under control...
