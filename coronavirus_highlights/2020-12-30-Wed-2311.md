## Dawn Wells, ‘Gilligan’s Island’s’ Mary Ann, Dies of COVID at 82

Summary of [original article](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/dawn-wells-dead-gilligans-island-mary-ann-1234876755/):

> Dawn Wells, who starred as "Good girl" Mary Ann in popular 1960s sitcom "Gilligan's Island," died Wednesday of causes related to COVID-19 in Los Angeles. Attired in her ubiquitous gingham dress, which is on display at the Hollywood museum, the Mary Ann character played the demure foil to Tina Louise's suggestive evening dress-clad Ginger. Wells represented Nevada in the 1959 Miss America pageant and appeared on several TV series before being cast in "Gilligan's Island" in 1964.

> I met her some 20 years ago on a dinner cruise honoring Gilligan's Island as a show pioneering the roles for women in TV. 
> 
> Naturally, I managed to get sea sick on a boat that was going about 5 knots up the Potomac River on glass smooth water. So for the dinner portion, I spent half of it in the rest room, and half of it in the stairwell leading down leaning up against the wall. 
> 
> Dawn saw me leaning there and broke off from her group, and stayed with me a good 20 minutes trying to cheer me up. I'll never forget how genuinely good a person she was.
> 
> Rest in Peace, Dawn.
> 
> Edit: Since this comment blew up, I'd just like to add this was simply a memory of mine I thought I'd share. She was an actress I enjoyed on a show I watched as a kid. It's something I will take to my grave.
> 
> But, it is no more important a memory than the millions of other memories out there that others have of those who have passed. Indeed, everyone has left indelible marks upon others, whether they realize it or not. 
> 
> May everyone who's passed rest in peace, and those that remember them find solace.

## COVID-19 ‘superspreader’ event feared in L.A. as Christian singer defies health order for concerts

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/covid-19-superspreader-event-feared-in-l-a-as-christian-singer-defies-health-order-for-concerts/):

> A conservative evangelical Christian singer with a history of defying COVID-19 health mandates plans three days of New Year's gatherings in the Los Angeles area, including stops on skid row and at a tent city in Echo Park, raising fears that the events will be viral "Super-spreaders." L.A. Councilman Kevin de León, who represents skid row, said his office and the mayor's staff will be on skid row Wednesday morning distributing personal protective equipment and sanitation kits to homeless people, but did not comment on possible enforcement of county COVID-19 health orders. Tom Grode, a skid row resident and activist who began petitioning the city a month ago to stop the skid row event , called Feucht's plan to come to Los Angeles "Incredibly foolish divisive and dangerous."

Summary of [original article](https://coloradosun.com/2020/12/30/colorado-coronavirus-vaccine-phase-1b/):

> Colorado hospitals and health clinics have now received enough coronavirus vaccine to provide a first dose to all frontline health care workers in the state, the Colorado National Guard general overseeing the state's vaccine distribution system said Tuesday. The federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has recorded 11 instances where a person suffered a notable side effect in Colorado from a coronavirus vaccine. In the meantime, Sherman said the state will begin ramping up Phase 1b even as it is still winding down Phase 1a. First responders in Denver and Pueblo have already received a first dose of the vaccine.

## “Those of Us Who Don’t Die Are Going to Quit”: A Crush of Patients, Dwindling Supplies and the Nurse Who Lost Hope

> As a teacher, let me tell you how it's going to continue:
> 
> Nurses who quit will be labeled as cowards or lazy, and those that are left will be managing a new normal where staffing is filled by lowering standards rather than increasing employment.
> 
> That's why there is rarely a reported teacher shortage. When you're short teachers you just increase class sizes. Soon there will be no nursing shortage because what a nurse is responsible for will increase.

## When There Wasn't Enough Hand Sanitizer, Distilleries Stepped Up. Now They're Facing $14,060 FDA Fees.

Summary of [original article](https://reason.com/2020/12/30/when-there-wasnt-enough-hand-sanitizer-distilleries-stepped-up-now-theyre-facing-14060-fda-fees/):

> Just as it seemed they'd made it through the worst of a terrible year, the Food and Drug Administration had one more surprise in store: The agency delivered notice to distilleries that had produced hand sanitizer in the early days of the pandemic that they now owe an unexpected fee to the government of more than $14,000. When the onset of the pandemic led to a massive increase in demand for hand sanitizer this spring, many distilleries stepped up to alleviate the sudden shortage. Under the revised law, distilleries that produced sanitizer have been classified as "Over-the-counter drug monograph facilities." The CARES Act also enacted user fees on these facilities to fund the FDA's regulatory activities.

> Literally half of my favorite distilleries did this.  Now you want to punish them for an American supply-chain problem during a pandemic?  Get wrecked.
