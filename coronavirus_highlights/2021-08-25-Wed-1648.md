## FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/owyf0w/faq_recent_cdc_guidance_vaccine_data_and_the/):

> Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.

## Delta raising health insurance for unvaccinated employees by $200/month

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/delta-air-lines-unvaccinated-employees-will-face-200-fees-if-they-dont-get-covid-vaccine.html):

> Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian notified employees Wednesday that they will face $200 monthly increases on their health insurance premiums starting Nov. 1 if they aren't vaccinated against Covid-19, citing steep costs to cover employees who are hospitalized with the virus. Unvaccinated employees will face other restrictions, including indoor masking effective immediately and weekly Covid-19 tests starting Sept. 12 the Atlanta-based airline said in announcing new Covid policies for employees. The airline, which self insures its employees, stands out in its plans to raise premiums for unvaccinated workers to cover the higher costs of insuring employees who get Covid.

> >	"This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company. In recent weeks since the rise of **the B.1.617.2 variant**, all Delta employees who have been hospitalized with COVID were not fully vaccinated."
> 
> LOL, that’s one way to avoid calling it “the Delta variant.”

## Bodies stacked to the ceiling as COVID-19 surge creates backlog at Florida funeral homes, crematories

Summary of [original article](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/bodies-stacked-to-the-ceiling-as-covid-19-surge-creates-backlog-at-florida-funeral-homes-crematories):

> The staff is working day and night to honor the dead. WESH 2 called 20 funeral homes and crematories and many were too busy to be part of our story. Mike Marchetti, the area manager for Newcomer Funeral Homes, says as much as they don't want to, sometimes they have to delay meetings with families and delay funerals because they only have so much staff. "So the family comes in and they say we would like to have the funeral on Friday and we have to tell then 'I'm sorry we can't accommodate a funeral on Friday because our schedule is full," Marchetti said.

## South Dakota Covid cases quintuple after Sturgis motorcycle rally

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/south-dakota-covid-cases-quintuple-after-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-n1277567?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma&fbclid=IwAR2BvVQ6tNB291OPj2m_VdwuCh4_YVFbubTLOk6mIkG7DZfD6AAJyB3Mlec):

> The 82 cases the county reported Tuesday was its highest daily number yet, eclipsing the 68 cases it reported on Aug. 27, 2020.From the onset of the pandemic, South Dakota has seen a higher per capita rate of infections than all but two states, North Dakota and Tennessee, per an NBC News tally. In an email Tuesday, a South Dakota Department of Health spokesperson, Daniel Bucheli, said the spikes in Covid cases in the state "Are following a national trend being experienced in every state." "Although the number of cases identified is sizable - 140 cases per 100,000 attendees - it is likely that the true national impact of the Sturgis event is underestimated," said the study, written in part by the CDC, citing asymptotic cases, visitors not reporting rally attendance and difficulties with contact tracing.

## US Plans Covid-19 Vaccine Boosters at Six Months Instead of Eight

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-plans-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-at-six-months-instead-of-eight-11629919356?mod=breakingnews):

> Federal regulators are likely to approve a Covid-19 booster shot for vaccinated adults starting at least six months after the previous dose rather than the eight-month gap they previously announced, a person familiar with the plans said, as the Biden administration steps up preparations for delivering boosters to the public. Data from vaccine manufacturers and other countries under review by the Food and Drug Administration is based on boosters being given at six months, the person said. Leana Wen, health policy professor at George Washington University, said approving boosters starting at six months after a previous dose makes sense based on available data on waning immunity.
