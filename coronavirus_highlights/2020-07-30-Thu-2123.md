Summary of [original article](https://uspirg.org/resources/usp/shut-it-down-start-over-do-it-right):

> Right now we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 American lives by November 1st. Yet, in many states people can drink in bars, get a haircut, eat inside a restaurant, get a tattoo, get a massage, and do myriad other normal, pleasant, but non-essential activities. Enough daily testing capacity to test everyone with flu-like symptoms plus anyone they have been in close contact with over the last 2 weeks. The more people get sick, the more testing is required.

> It's fine everything is fine.  The contact tracers just have to work a little harder to trace her contacts and her contacts contacts, her contacts contacts contacts, etc for only 28 days.  Should be easy, that's probably only a few thousand people.  A test delayed 28 days is basically useless.

> Jesus would have worn a mask, because he actually cared about other people and setting a good example. Also, he could walk on water and make a lot of fish out of a little bit of fish, and those are just his marine-related tricks.
