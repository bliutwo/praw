## Disney theme park staff worry about Covid-19: 'I can't bring it back home

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/disney-world-coronavirus-staff-worry-covid-19-reopening):

> "People are afraid of going back to work because of the imminent threat of contracting Covid, since we, Florida, are now the epicenter of the world for this pandemic, and they are also afraid of not going back to work because we have no financial support," said Rey. "My main concern going back to work is: I have young children and my mom is elderly. I can't bring coronavirus home. It's not really safe to go back to work. The cases are rising in California," said Inez Guzman, who has worked in housekeeping at the Disneyland Hotel for five years. A representative for Disney told the Guardian the opening of Disneyland was pending guidance from state officials, while worker training, a range of health and safety measures, cleaning, disinfecting and technological solutions have been implemented ahead of Disney World's reopening.
