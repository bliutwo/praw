## New Indiana Mandate Declares Not Wearing a Mask in Public As a Class-B Misdemeanor

Summary of [original article](https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/local-news/watch-live-gov-holcomb-gives-indiana-covid-19-update-7/):

> INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - Governor Holcomb announced on Wednesday that masks will now be mandated across the state of Indiana beginning Monday, July 27th. The mandate will require masks in all public indoor spaces and outdoor spaces when social distancing is not possible. Masks are strongly recommended for ages 2-7.Indiana's mask mandate comes after neighboring Illinois, Michigan and Kentucky have already begun such mandates. "Too many Indiana companies, employees and their families are in their fifth month of financial turmoil. That will not change and our economy will not be on the full road to recovery until some certainty is brought to this uncontrolled pandemic. The wearing of masks is a proven strategy for protecting others and enhancing our health - both physical and economic."

## Random testing in Indiana shows COVID-19 is 6 times deadlier than flu, and 2.8% of the state has been infected

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/random-testing-in-indiana-shows-covid-19-is-6-times-deadlier-than-flu-and-2-8-of-the-state-has-been-infected-138709):

> I am a professor of health policy and management at Indiana University, and random testing is exactly what we did in my state. With the help of the Indiana State Department of Health, numerous state agencies and community leaders, we set up 70 testing stations in cities and towns across Indiana. The infection-fatality rate of 0.58% is thankfully far lower, but is nearly six times higher than the seasonal flu which has a death rate of 0.1%. This random testing also allowed us to make accurate estimates about what percent of infected people are asymptomatic.
