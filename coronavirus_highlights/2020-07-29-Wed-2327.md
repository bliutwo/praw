> So either:
> 
> A) HCQ doesn't work against Covid-19 as shown by 5 published RCTs and 2 unpublished RCTs.
> 
> or
> 
> B) HCQ is incredibly efficacious against Covid, a "cure" so to speak.  The usage of HCQ is being suppressed by a vast international cabal consisting of thousands of scientists, doctors, government health agencies **worldwide** costing hundreds of thousands of lives solely to affect the outcome of the american election.  These doctors **worldwide** despite their oaths to do no harm are intentionally killing people just to affect the US election.   In fact if HCQ was widely used, the pandemic would end, costing this vast cabal their attempt at controlling the world.

This treatment regimen did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1%, control vs. 5.9%, intervention; RR 0.75 \[0.32;1.77\]) nor shortened the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs. 10 days, intervention; p = 0.38).

> Of 491 patients randomly assigned to a group, 423 contributed primary end point data. Of these, 341 (81%) had laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed infection; 56% (236 of 423) were enrolled within 1 day of symptoms starting. Change in symptom severity over 14 days **did not differ** between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (difference in symptom severity: relative, 12%; absolute, −0.27 points \[95% CI, −0.61 to 0.07 points\]; P = 0.117). At 14 days, 24% (49 of 201) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine had ongoing symptoms compared with 30% (59 of 194) receiving placebo (P = 0.21). Medication adverse effects occurred in 43% (92 of 212) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine versus 22% (46 of 211) receiving placebo (P < 0.001). With placebo, 10 hospitalizations occurred (2 non–COVID-19–related), including 1 hospitalized death. With hydroxychloroquine, 4 hospitalizations occurred plus 1 nonhospitalized death (P = 0.29).

> Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine **was not associated with reductions** in 28-day mortality but was **associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.**

> RCTs almost perfectly control for variation between the tested groups.  The only difference between the 2 groups in a good RCT is the treatment.  Unlike observational studies that have unmeasured/unobserved confounding factors between the groups.  It's why RCTs are the gold standard in research.

## Dr. Fauci recommends wearing goggles to prevent catching the coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dr-fauci-recommends-wearing-goggles-to-prevent-catching-the-coronavirus-2020-07-29):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci says that eye protection may be recommended at some point to help prevent spreading COVID-19. It only suggests protective eyewear for health care professionals, noting on its site that "Use of eye protection is recommended in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission." So you might see doctors or nurses wearing goggles or face shields in the ICU or areas where they are coming into close contact with COVID-19 patients. Early research has found that only a small percentage of hospitalized COVID-19 patients whose eye fluid was tested came up positive for having the virus in their eyes - although it should be noted that swabbing eye fluid isn't standard in coronavirus patient care, so there could certainly be more cases than have been recorded.
