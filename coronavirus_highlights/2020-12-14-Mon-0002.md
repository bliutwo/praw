## Kizzmekia Corbett, an African American woman, is praised as key scientist behind COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kizzmekia-corbett-african-american-woman-praised-key-scientist/story?id=74679965):

> "The very vaccine that's one of the two that has absolutely exquisite levels - 94 to 95% efficacy against clinical disease and almost 100% efficacy against serious disease that are shown to be clearly safe - that vaccine was actually developed in my institute's vaccine research center by a team of scientists led by Dr. Barney Graham and his close colleague, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, or Kizzy Corbett," Fauci told the forum. Corbett is part of a team at NIH that worked with Moderna, the pharmaceutical company that developed one of the two mRNA vaccines that has shown to be more than 90% effective. Fauci said Corbett's role as one of the scientists behind the vaccines should be a sign of hope for Black Americans who are hesitant to trust the vaccine.

## New Hampshire’s GOP governor blasts anti-maskers after House speaker dies of covid-19: ‘Don’t act like a bunch of children’

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/11/dick-hinch-dead-speaker-covid/):

> New Hampshire Republican state Rep. Dick Hinch wept as he accepted a nomination as speaker of the house at an outdoor swearing-in ceremony with hundreds of his peers, including dozens without masks. At a news conference Thursday, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu lauded Hinch as a "Tireless leader" and described him as a close friend, calling his death a "Cautionary tale" about the costs of failing to wear a mask. On Nov. 9, Hinch and about 50 New Hampshire GOP representatives were photographed at an indoor gathering to celebrate the election results, in which they gained the majority in the state House.
