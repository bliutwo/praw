## Obama, Bush, Clinton volunteer to get COVID-19 vaccine on camera

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/obama-bush-clinton-volunteer-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-on-camera-651011):

> Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to get the COVID-19 vaccine on camera to promote confidence in the vaccine's safety for the public, CNN reported on Wednesday. Obama told SiriusXM host Joe Madison that, when the vaccine is available, he plans on getting it and may even get it on camera if that will help people to trust it. The possibility that many citizens will refuse to take the vaccine has worried health officials in recent months, although more and more Americans have become willing to accept the vaccine since Pfizer and Moderna released efficacy updates last month.

## 'I'm 23 years old and I just had a stroke': Arizona man goes viral after COVID-19 experience

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/02/riley-behrens-viral-after-covid-19-causes-stroke-young-people/3793351001/):

> Behrens was most surprised to see that there were other people in their early 20s commenting how they had experienced the same symptom after contracting COVID-19 that he had - a mild stroke. A week ago, Behrens had no idea that young people all over the world were having TIAs, or transient ischemic attacks, as complications of the novel coronavirus. Several studies, including one from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, have shown evidence of neurological complications of COVID-19 in people who have no risk factors for them and who are otherwise mildly symptomatic.

## ‘There absolutely will be a black market’: How the rich and privileged can skip the line for Covid-19 vaccines

Summary of [original article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/03/how-rich-and-privileged-can-skip-the-line-for-covid19-vaccines/):

> The worst attempts to nefariously procure a vaccine may come a few months into distribution, once vaccines are available that don't require ultra-cold storage and local pharmacies and physician practices get allotments. "Some of the richest investment firms have their own mini health systems, so they can run vaccines through those doctors that give the physicals and maintain the health of the executives in the company," said NYU's Caplan. "If someone can see a way to make good money off of driving a pallet of vaccines off in a forklift, I'm sure somebody will figure out how to do it."

`/u/NikkiSharpe` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5x6fr/there_absolutely_will_be_a_black_market_how_the/):

> Yes, yes, we all know the rich and powerful and famous people will get the vaccine first. But for god's sake, don't brag about it on Insta. 
> 
> They already did that about their COVID tests back when normal people could barely get tested. Keep your damn mouths shut about all your privilege.

## Оbama will take coronavirus vaccine and might film it to build confidence – ‘I trust this science’

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/covid-vaccine-obama-will-take-doses-might-film-to-build-confidence.html?rss=1):

> Former President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he will take a coronavirus vaccine once one is available and may film it to build confidence in the U.S. about vaccine safety. Obama's comment came as numerous polls find many Americans are skeptical about getting a Covid-19 vaccine, potentially jeopardizing U.S. vaccination efforts to control the pandemic, which has now taken at least 1.48 million lives worldwide. "If you are in that category, if you are elderly, if you've got a preexisting condition, if you're a frontline worker, if you're a medical worker, if you are in a grocery store, if you're a first responder, you should take that vaccine," he said.

`/u/outrider567` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5lk1g/оbama_will_take_coronavirus_vaccine_and_might/):

> Every politician should do the same, both here in the US, and Europe as well
