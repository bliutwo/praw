## It’s Official—Americans Won’t Be Allowed Into Europe When It Reopens

Summary of [original article](https://www.afar.com/magazine/europe-finally-set-to-reopen-but-not-to-us-travelers):

> The European Union has revealed the list of countries whose travelers will be welcomed back to the continent on July 1, and it does not include the United States, according to a New York Times. The list still needs to be formalized by the governments of each member state as well as by the European Union before taking effect on July 1, but officials reportedly said they did not expect the list to change. As the Times points out, it's not a legally binding list, but any member state that opens borders to countries not on the list could find themselves shut off from other E.U. partners.

## 80% of US adults report wearing a mask all, most, or some of the time when in stores or other businesses. Only 7% say they never do.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/23/most-americans-say-they-regularly-wore-a-mask-in-stores-in-the-past-month-fewer-see-others-doing-it/):

> Americans in counties with more reported deaths from the coronavirus when adjusted for population are much more likely to say they wore a mask all or most of the time in stores or other businesses in the past month than those in counties where the death rate can be classified as more moderate or low. There are also differences across racial and ethnic groups, with whites being the least likely to say they have regularly worn masks: 62% of white adults say they wore a mask in stores or other businesses all or most of the time in the past month, compared with 69% of black adults, 74% of Hispanic adults and 80% of Asian adults. When asked more generally about mask-wearing in the communities where they live, 44% of Americans say that all or most of the people in their area have been wearing masks in stores or other businesses, 40% say that some people have been wearing masks, 11% say only a few people have been wearing masks and 1% say no one in their community has been wearing a mask.

> "Some of the time" is doing a lot of work here. 
> 
> A friend of mine drove to Hilton Head for a vacation a little while ago, and when he went into to the restaurant to ask for an outdoor table, he said not only were he and his wife the only ones with masks, but most of the people in the restaurant _turned around to point and stare at them_. The social pressure to _not_ wear a mask in some places is ridiculous.

> I'm glad to be a place wear mask-wearing is normalized. Most people I see are wearing them.

## In a disturbing parallel to H.I.V., the coronavirus can cause a depletion of important immune cells, recent studies found

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html?referringSource=articleShare):

> In many patients hospitalized with the coronavirus, the immune system is threatened by a depletion of certain essential cells, suggesting eerie parallels with H.I.V.The findings suggest that a popular treatment to tamp down the immune system in severely ill patients may help a few, but could harm many others. In a separate study, the investigators identified three patterns of immune defects, and concluded that T cells and B cells, which help orchestrate the immune response, were inactive in roughly 30 percent of the 71 Covid-19 patients they examined. In Covid-19 patients - as was the case in patients with SARS and MERS, also caused by coronaviruses - IP10 levels go up and stay up.

> Quoted from the article;
> 
> The emerging picture indicates that the model for H.I.V. treatment, a cocktail of antiviral drugs, may be a good bet both for those with mild illnesses and those who are severely ill.
> 
> Some experts have wondered if antiviral treatment makes sense for severely ill Covid-19 patients, if their main affliction is an immune system overreaction.
> 
> But if the virus directly causes the immune system to malfunction, Dr. Hayday said, then an antiviral makes sense — and perhaps even more than one, since it’s important to stop the infection before it depletes T cells and harms other parts of the immune system.
> 
> “I have not lost one ounce of my optimism,” Dr. Hayday said. Even without a vaccine, he foresees Covid-19 becoming a manageable disease, controlled by drugs that act directly against the virus.
> 
> “A vaccine would be great,” he said. “But with the logistics of its global rollout being so challenging, it’s comforting to think we may not depend on one.”
> 
> Edit: this begs the question if giving remdesivir to patients from the get-go might be more beneficial than offering it to severe cases only?

## Italy for 1st time sees single-digit daily deaths from COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/latest-on-coronavirus-outbreak/italy-for-1st-time-sees-single-digit-daily-deaths-from-covid-19/1892183):

> ROME. Italy on Saturday reported eight more novel coronavirus-related fatalities - the lowest daily rise since the beginning of the outbreak in early March - bringing the country's death toll to 34,716. The record low in daily deaths contrasts with news of new clusters that recently emerged across the country, from north to south. The Italian government said on Friday that schools will reopen on Sept. 14, after more than six months of closure.

## South Carolina National Guard preparing to add 3,000 hospital beds at hotels and gymnasiums as the occupancy rate approaches critical levels.

`/u/moby323` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hhdabe/south_carolina_national_guard_preparing_to_add/):

> Right now occupancy is at 75%. Once it hits 80% the emergency measures will start going into effect.
> 
> 
> One of the very troubling things about the virus in regards to available ICU beds is that the illness lasts a long time. 
> 
> If a person is in a serious car accident, for example, and has to be placed in the ICU, they are usually well enough after a few days to be stepped down. They are improving every day and now you just wait for them to heal. 
> 
> 
> But with COVID, people can stay in the ICU for *weeks*. Which means not only is the ICU bed occupied, it’s occupied for the foreseeable future and won’t be available to new patients. That adds up. 
> 
> 
> Another important thing to remember is that these available beds are not spread evenly throughout the state. The hospitals in population centers are almost full, a lot of the empty beds are in rural areas. That means we will have to start shifting patients around to free up beds where they are needed and this presents a whole host of serious problems.

## How 63 People Walked Into a Michigan Bar That Followed Safety Guidelines — and Still Got Coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://gandernewsroom.com/2020/06/25/34-people-bar-coronavirus):

> Just days after reopening during the pandemic, a first round of 14 young people were diagnosed with the coronavirus after visiting Harper's Restaurant & Brewpub, an East Lansing bar serving the Michigan State University community. "There are likely more people infected with COVID-19 not yet identified. We need help from people who went to Harper's during the exposure dates so that we can contain the outbreak. We need everyone exposed to stay home." "Anyone could have COVID-19. You never know because some people with coronavirus are not yet sick, and some people never have signs of the disease," said Vail.
