> The issue isn't where should the unused doses sit, but rather, how do we expedite injections. My state has used 30% of supply thus far. Under this, all thst changes is they'd have only used 15% of supply. How about just figuring out how to do injections effectively.

## Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55586410):

> A third Covid vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one that is already being offered on the NHS. The UK has ordered an extra 10 million doses of this vaccine, taking the total order to 17 million, but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. EU regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine, which is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.

`/u/Wrynouth3` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt5xa0/dr_fauci_wants_americans_to_wear_masks_for_at/):

> This is a good message to at least get out there. No more, no less and we will see where things are at after 100 days. Yes, I realize not everyone is going to wear a mask for at least 100 days and we will probably have to have these masks until at best summer, but this is what they should be saying. One has to wonder how much Fauci and Biden realize COVID fatigue in regards to larger events and social distancing will start fo set in, because I don’t give that much longer than after the first 100 days even if it is still needed through summer.
