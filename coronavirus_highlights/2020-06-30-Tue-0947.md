## Goldman Sachs says a national mask mandate could slash infections and save economy from a 5% hit

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/goldman-sachs-says-a-national-mask-mandate-could-slash-infections-and-save-economy-from-a-5percent-hit.html):

> A federal face mask mandate would not only cut the daily growth rate of new confirmed cases of Covid-19, but could also save the U.S. economy from taking a 5% GDP hit in lieu of additional lockdowns, according to Goldman Sachs. The results are "Large and highly significant" and show that state mask mandates raise the percentage of people who say they "Always" or "Frequently" wear masks by about 25 percentage points in the 30 days after the government order. All told, Goldman's base case is that a national mandate to wear face masks could raise the percentage of Americans who wear masks by 15 percentage points and slash the daily growth rate of confirmed cases by 1 percentage point to 0.6%. The investment bank then translated those results into GDP terms by asking how severe any government-imposed lockdowns would have to be to cut infections by 1 percentage point.

## Riverside County, California - hospitals hit 99% capacity for ICUs. Only 5 empty beds for a 2.5 million population

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-29/riverside-county-icu-beds-hit-99-capacity-the-situation-may-not-be-as-dire-as-it-seems):

> Riverside County intensive care unit beds nearly hit capacity Sunday, when patients occupied 99% of the normal number of beds. Though Riverside County normally offers 385 licensed ICU beds, hospitals have already placed some overflow patients in surge-capacity beds. To fall within the acceptable metrics, the county would need to have more available ICU beds, fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 people and a positive test rate lower than 8%. Though Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Sunday that seven counties immediately close all bars and nightclubs, Riverside County was not included in the order.

## Restaurant closes dining room, says angry customers not worth it

Summary of [original article](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/06/29/restaurant-closes-dining-room-says-angry-customers-not-worth/3280869001/):

> A popular Mexican restaurant in Dearborn Heights has closed its dining room after two weeks of battling customers over rules requiring them to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Alvarado said the verbal run-ins including customers being generally insulting, using foul language, accusing the restaurant of infringing on their rights or saying it's not medically safe. The Free Press reported last week that restaurant owners in metro Detroit say they are finding it difficult to police face mask wearing and social distancing rules as they try to keep customers and their staffs safe.

> Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine another wave of restaurant shutdowns, not because of government mandates, but because the people who choose to dine in during a deadly pandemic are the hardcore "worst of the worst" customers.
