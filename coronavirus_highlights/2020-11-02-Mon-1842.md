Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/02/nation/charlie-baker-orders-people-wear-masks-public-no-matter-how-far-they-are-other-people):

> The order applies to both indoor and outdoor public places. Like the previous order, which went into effect on May 6, it covers, among other things, grocery stores, pharmacies, and retail stores; public transportation, taxis, livery, and ridesharing vehicles. "We're basically saying, 'If you go out in public, wear a mask,'" Baker said.

> > “The new order requires everyone above the age of 5 to wear a face covering in public. We’re making this clear for everyone. No more exceptions —and no exemptions for when you can maintain social distance,” Baker said at a State House news conference.
> 
> > “It’s our hope that this simpler, more straightforward rule becomes easier for the public to follow and easier for local officials to enforce this mandatory order this way,” he said.
> 
> Well, it *is* a lot easier to enforce now.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/more-61-000-children-got-covid-19-last-week-record-n1245851):

> More than 61,000 children in the U.S. were diagnosed with Covid-19 last week - more than in any other week during the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association reported Monday. The percentage of pediatric cases has risen steadily since mid-April, when children accounted for just 2 percent of Covid-19 cases in the country. Children accounted for less than 3.5 percent of current Covid-19 hospitalizations, the report found.
