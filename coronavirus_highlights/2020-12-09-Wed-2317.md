## How is it possible to create a safe and effective vaccine in such a short period of time?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/):

> In light of the vaccine approvals that have already come and will likely continue to develop over the coming days and weeks, we wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the background for how we've been able to safely and effectively develop a vaccine so rapidly. Vaccine scientists were able to begin development of vaccine candidates in mid-January, even though the virus was still difficult to obtain at that time. Finally, trials for vaccine candidates often take a long time to complete even after enrollment because many of the pathogens they seek to prevent are relatively rare or regional; as a result, it takes considerably longer for enough infection events to occur, and accordingly longer to be able to determine whether the vaccine is effective.

> Vaccine development is expensive because you have to do lots of research.
> 
> To keep costs down you do the different research in stages so you can save money and stop when some stage fails.
> 
> When you have lots of money you can do everything unconditionally and in parallel.
> 
> That makes all the difference.

## U.S. records more than 3,000 deaths in a single day, a new high

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/09/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/):

> The People's Vaccine Alliance cautioned that some wealthier countries, including Canada, have already purchased enough vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over. As more vaccines near completion, the group warned, there may not be equitable sharing with poorer countries. "No one should be blocked from getting a lifesaving vaccine because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket," Anna Marriott, health policy manager at Oxfam, said in a statement.

> It's sometimes hard to visualize that many people for me.
> 
> I look back at my days in high school.  I went to a pretty big high school.  About 3,000 students.  That's my entire high school population disappearing - everyday - on top of all the other ways people "normally" die.

## Infected after 5 minutes, from 20 feet away: South Korea study shows coronavirusâ€™ spread indoors

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-09/five-minutes-from-20-feet-away-south-korean-study-shows-perils-of-indoor-dining-for-covid-19):

> The study - adding to a growing body of evidence on airborne transmission of the virus - highlighted how South Korea's meticulous and often invasive contact tracing regime has enabled researchers to closely track how the virus moves through populations. "There's a real misconception about this in the public," said Seung, who was not involved in the South Korea study. The study was published at a time when South Korea, like many other countries, is on edge amid a new wave of coronavirus infections, with daily case rates hovering around 600 in recent days.

`/u/bananafor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ka1s04/infected_after_5_minutes_from_20_feet_away_south/):

> Studies show it's more like 28 feet. The six foot rule was just to keep people separated in a practical way for grocery shopping, walking in parks, but somehow people think they are safe at six feet.
> 
> You can also catch it through your eyes, masks over your eyes and nose aren't really enough. It has been estimated 11% of the risk is through the eyes.

> California's Lake Tahoe is temporarily shutting down to outside tourists, the latest economic blow as a deadly surge in coronavirus cases is forcing millions in America's most populous state back under lockdown restrictions. On Tuesday, the greater Sacramento region, which comprises the Lake Tahoe area, joined the group of counties under lockdown because capacity in hospital intensive care units has fallen below 15%. Officials in the famed lake ski and resort area are urging people to stay away.
