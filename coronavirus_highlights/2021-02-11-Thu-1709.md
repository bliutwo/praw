## Fauci: Vaccines for Kids as Young as First Graders Could Be Authorized by September

Summary of [original article](https://link.propublica.org/click/22912653.255948/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJvcHVibGljYS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9mYXVjaS12YWNjaW5lcy1raWRzP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9c2FpbHRocnUmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bWFqb3JpbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9ucyZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1mZWF0dXJl/5f636d21d242e74796151f5bBaf23a9eb):

> Children as young as first graders may be able to get the coronavirus vaccine by the time school starts in September, presuming trials are successful in those age groups, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with ProPublica. O'Leary said children as young as 6 months, which is the youngest age that Moderna plans to test, can get vaccinated so long as trial data shows the vaccines to be safe and effective. While O'Leary is not as confident as Fauci that we'll see Pfizer's data on younger kids by September, he feels very optimistic about the availability of a vaccine in the coming months for kids as young as 12, who tend to get sicker than the younger age group.
