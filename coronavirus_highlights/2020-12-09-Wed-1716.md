> Vaccine development is expensive because you have to do lots of research.
> 
> To keep costs down you do the different research in stages so you can save money and stop when some stage fails.
> 
> When you have lots of money you can do everything unconditionally and in parallel.
> 
> That makes all the difference.

## Health Canada approves Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vaccine-rollout-plan-phac-1.5833912):

> "The efficacy of the vaccine was established to be approximately 95 per cent. The vaccine was well tolerated by participants and has no important safety concerns. The benefit-to-risk assessment for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is considered favourable." Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the military commander who is leading vaccine logistics for the Public Health Agency of Canada, has said the national operations centre would be ready to deploy vaccines shortly after they're approved in Canada. Fortin has been leading a series of dry-runs with the provinces and territories to ensure they are prepared to distribute the extremely heat-sensitive Pfizer shot, which must be stored at temperatures between -80 C and -60 C. Canada is expected to take delivery next week of vaccines produced in Puurs, a small town in the north of Belgium that will be churning out hundreds of millions of doses of the co-developed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the European Union, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom over the next 12 months.

## Infected after 5 minutes, from 20 feet away: South Korea study shows coronavirus’ spread indoors

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-09/five-minutes-from-20-feet-away-south-korean-study-shows-perils-of-indoor-dining-for-covid-19):

> The study - adding to a growing body of evidence on airborne transmission of the virus - highlighted how South Korea's meticulous and often invasive contact tracing regime has enabled researchers to closely track how the virus moves through populations. "There's a real misconception about this in the public," said Seung, who was not involved in the South Korea study. The study was published at a time when South Korea, like many other countries, is on edge amid a new wave of coronavirus infections, with daily case rates hovering around 600 in recent days.

`/u/bananafor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ka1s04/infected_after_5_minutes_from_20_feet_away_south/):

> Studies show it's more like 28 feet. The six foot rule was just to keep people separated in a practical way for grocery shopping, walking in parks, but somehow people think they are safe at six feet.
> 
> You can also catch it through your eyes, masks over your eyes and nose aren't really enough. It has been estimated 11% of the risk is through the eyes.
