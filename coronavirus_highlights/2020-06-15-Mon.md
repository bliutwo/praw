## 67% of Jobless Workers Get More in Unemployment Than They Earned

Summary of [original article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/15/67-of-jobless-workers-get-more-in-unemployment-tha.aspx):

> The CARES Act made important changes to unemployment benefits to help better provide for workers suffering due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Go back to work ASAP. It may seem counterintuitive to suggest returning to work as soon as possible if you're making more on unemployment. Missing out on either of these benefits could end up costing you more than you gain from the extra unemployment income.

> To me this clearly demonstrates how much wages have stagnated. The government essentially paying unemployed people merely what it estimates they need to get by constitutes a significant pay raise. It's not about lazy, it's about being undervalued, underappreciated, and under-compensated.

## “Totally predictable”: State reopenings have backfired | Vox

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/6/12/21288009/new-covid-spikes-arizona-florida-carolinas-texas):

> The 7-day average of new cases has been between 20-23k cases for nearly a month. Simply put, reopenings have led to more infections because more people are coming into contact with each other while there's still a lot of virus around. These new spikes in cases appear to be occurring in places that have largely avoided the worst coronavirus outbreaks so far.

> So...what are states plans here?  They opened up, and in many areas it’ll be catastrophic to role back restrictions at this point  but also catastrophic for hospitals to be overrun. Not to mention I suspect a second lockdown would have even less compliance than the first one.  So...what IS the plan?

> " *McDonald's* [*announced*](https://news.mcdonalds.com/news-releases/news-release-details/setting-record-straight-were-taking-care-our-family) *last month it made nearly "50 process changes" last month in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health experts to protect its 850,000 employees and customers. Some of these processes included wellness and temperature checks, PPE such as masks and gloves, social distancing guidelines, increased cleaning, installation of protective barriers, a reopening "playbook" and sick pay.* "  ... and yet this employee was able to work 7 days while sick and as mentioned in the article "symptomatic". Sounds like their process either was just lip service or isn't working.

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/people-with-blood-type-o-are-more-protected-against-covid-19-studies-show-631502):

> Those that are in the A blood type group carry A-sugar-antigens, the same goes for people in the blood type B with B-antigens, however O blood type have neither. This means that the immune systems of people with type A blood develop antibodies for B antigens, people with type B blood have antibodies for A antigens, and people with type O blood have antibodies for both. Explained more in depth, a person in the blood type O group will have antibodies against virus transmission from someone in the blood type A group.
