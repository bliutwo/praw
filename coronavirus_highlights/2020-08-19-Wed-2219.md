## One State Is Requiring Its Students to Get Flu Vaccine by End of Year — and, Yes, It’s Legal

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/covid-19-pandemic/one-state-is-requiring-its-students-to-get-flu-vaccine-by-end-of-year-and-yes-its-legal/):

> In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a mandatory smallpox vaccination law in the landmark case stylized as Jacobson v. Massachusetts. According to settled principles, the police power of a state must be held to embrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactment as will protect the public health and the public safety. Notably, the Supreme Court also said that governments must be reasonable with mandatory public health laws and not act "In such an arbitrary and oppressive manner as to justify the interference of the courts to prevent wrong and oppression."

## Most Americans embarrassed by U.S. response to coronavirus, CNN poll finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/most-americans-embarrassed-by-u-s-response-to-coronavirus-cnn-poll-finds-1.5070410):

> Nearly 7 in 10 Americans say the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak makes them feel embarrassed, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, as 62% of the public says President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak. The poll finds a decline in the share of Americans who say they would try to get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine became widely available at a low cost: 56% say they would try to do so now, while 66% felt that way in May. The dip comes across several demographic divides but seems to be concentrated among Trump supporters, 51% of whom said they would seek out a vaccine in May compared with 38% who say the same now. In one positive note for Trump in these findings, his approval rating for handling the economy has ticked up to 51%. But Americans don't yet see much improvement in the economic downturn caused by th4e coronavirus.

`/u/OrionBell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/icoy8o/most_americans_embarrassed_by_us_response_to/):

> It's more than embarrassing. It's infuriating how selfish and unpatriotic a portion of our society is, and how they are being encouraged by bad leadership. Yes, I am embarrassed by the response of the American government, but I am ashamed and outraged by the minority of our citizens who just don't care about anybody except themselves. Shame on you people who act like that. If you had enough self-awareness to be embarrassed, we wouldn't have to shun you and shame you and cut you from our social circles and look upon you with disgust for the rest of your lives.
