Summary of [original article](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/cdc-denies-native-american-tribes-requests-for-coronavirus-data-that-is-freely-available-to-states/):

> Politico: American Indian Tribes Thwarted In Efforts To Get Coronavirus Data Federal and state health agencies are refusing to give Native American tribes and organizations representing them access to data showing how the coronavirus is spreading around their lands, potentially widening health disparities and frustrating tribal leaders already ill-equipped to contain the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has turned down tribal epidemiologists' requests for data that it's making freely available to states. Authorities in Michigan and Massachusetts since early spring have also resisted handing over information on testing and confirmed cases, citing privacy concerns, and refused to strike agreements with tribes on contact tracing or other surveillance, eight tribal leaders and health experts told POLITICO.

## Texas Has Shifted to an “It’s Your Responsibility” Pandemic Plan

Summary of [original article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/texas-has-shifted-to-an-its-your-responsibility-pandemic-plan/):

> As the state moves into a new phase of the pandemic, with cases on the rise, focus has shifted away from mandatory public safety measures and toward placing the responsibility for slowing the spread of the disease in the hands of each individual Texan. A version of "Personal responsibility" that looks like "I'll take responsibility for my risk, and you take responsibility for your risk," though, neglects the reality of a pandemic. With Texas entering the most dangerous period of the pandemic yet, the times most certainly do.

> Aguirre says one family member after another has been infected. "Some people just don't get it this is real. Five family members have died. Myself, my wife, my kids, my brothers, have all tested positive. How many more people have to die?" Aguirre said. "Is it really worth losing your life over a day of party? Going out to the lake?... Even going out to a restaurant? It's just not worth it," Aguirre said.

## ABC News: Hawaii grapples with Great Depression-level unemployment as tourism plummets because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One town has 35% unemployment, higher than the peak of the Great Depression.

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ghost-town-tourism-plummets-coronavirus-hawaii-grapples-great/story?id=70880589):

> Peter Yee has been furloughed from his job at a rental car company since late March, and now says he spends up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week answering questions and sharing advice in the Facebook group, "Hawaii Unemployment Updates and Support Group." The unemployment rate in Kahului skyrocketed to 35% in April - nearly 10% higher than the national unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Depression - and the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S., according to the latest data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Carl Bonham, the executive director and a professor at the Economic Research Organization at University of Hawaii, told ABC News that the most recent data puts Hawaii's unemployment rate at 22.3% in April, but because these surveys were conducted early that month before many of the job losses, some economists estimate it's 30% or more.

> A heads up to anyone who needs help who lives in or near Kihei, on the south side of Maui: for the last three weekends and for at least the next month and a half from now, every Friday evening starting around 5 or 5:30 (please doublecheck this to make sure,) there is a giveaway of a free dinner at Nalu's restaurant. It's completely free, and it's drive-through: all you have to do is drive up and tell someone how many meals you need - they will hand out up to five per car. No judgment is made if you drive up in a fancy car - having a nice car does not mean you have any income anymore now.
