> Obesity increases the risk of dying of Covid-19 by nearly 50% and may make vaccines against the disease less effective, according to a comprehensive study using global data. The findings, which the lead researcher described as "Scary", show that the risks for people with obesity are greater than previously thought. Popkin said vaccine developers should look at the data from their clinical trials for the obesity effect, even where they have an overall benefit.

## CDC loses its mind, says people exposed to COVID-19 do not need testing

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/cdc-loses-its-mind-says-people-exposed-to-covid-19-do-not-need-testing/):

> Now, the CDC says that exposed but symptomless people do not need to be tested.

The CDC warns these employees about the risk of violence from people who refuse to follow recommended or required health measures.

## Nearly 9,000 Florida Children Diagnosed With Coronavirus in Two Weeks as Schools Reopen

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-9000-florida-children-diagnosed-coronavirus-two-weeks-schools-reopen-1527587):

> The number of Florida children diagnosed with the coronavirus has increased by nearly 9,000 over the past two weeks as schools across the state begin to reopen. The increase in virus cases among Florida children comes as schools across the state begin to reopen. In July, an emergency order issued by Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran required all school districts to open "Brick and mortar schools at least five days a week for all students." The order notes that the final decision to reopen schools will rest with local superintendents and school boards but suggests that funding for the school may depend on reopening.

> Shouldn’t this be a major story? In the last 2 weeks one state has reported 9000 kids infected with the virus? While they just reopened schools. Should be a headline everywhere on the school debate

## 6 feet may not always be enough distance to protect from COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/6-feet-may-not-always-be-enough-distance-protect-covid-n1238083):

> Some evidence suggests that the coronavirus may travel more than 6 feet through activities like coughing and shouting, the researchers wrote. In the highest-risk situations, such as indoors with poor ventilation, large crowds, prolonged contact time and no face coverings, distancing beyond 6 feet should be considered. Evidence suggests that the 6-foot distance should be the minimum indoors, said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech."People have put too much weight on 6 feet as being this dividing line between risky and safe. And this clearly shows we've known that 6 feet is a guideline but that the farther the better," Marr said.
