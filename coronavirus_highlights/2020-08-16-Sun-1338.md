## Teacher creates national database of COVID-19-related school closings, cases and deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/education/2020/08/15/dedicated-educator-creates-budding-national-database-coronavirus-related-school-closings-cases-and-d/5591124002/):

> A dedicated educator's local project, initiated out of anticipation of the upcoming academic year, has grown into a national database that tracks coronavirus-related school closings, cases and deaths. Alisha Morris, who teaches theater in Kansas' Olathe School District, was scouring the internet for news reports about COVID-19 issues surrounding K-12 school re-openings across the country when she became overwhelmed with information. Morris said she discovered more than 2,000 students, faculty, administrators and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide since the beginning of last month, with the cases being traced to myriad events including in-person schooling, staff meetings, extracurricular activities, summer camps, extended school year programs, graduation ceremonies and others.

> It's incredible to me that states/governments aren't collecting this information. It's so important that people can make informed decisions about opening schools and the impacts of various mitagation measures. 
> 
> I'm not only talking about the US here, I live in the UK and I would be very surprised if my government made this sort of information available to school and local authorities, let alone the general public. If you had asked me 6 months ago I would have simply assumed that governments would collect and share this as a matter of good public health policy, but 2020 has shaken any vestiges of faith i may have have had that politicians have the peoples interests at heart.

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/rich-countries-coronavirus-data-united-states-cc412dd5-ef7d-4dc9-a891-e300712860e7.html):

> Over the past several weeks, the coronavirus has killed Americans at six times the average rate in other rich countries. How it happened: Other rich countries saw pandemic peaks that were just as terrifying as America's. Of the 10 countries currently recording the highest daily caseloads, the U.S. is the only high-income country.

## Toronto: strip club employee may have exposed about 550 people to Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/canada-toronto-strip-club-brass-rail-tavern-covid-19):

> Health officials in the Canadian city of Toronto have warned that as many as 550 people may have been exposed to the coronavirus at a downtown strip club after an employee tested positive for the virus. Toronto health officials suggested their initial investigation found the club to be lacking when it came to following the required protocols, which include distancing between staff and customers and the use of a plexiglass shield when this is not possible. The Toronto Star noted that the club had posted a message on its front door.

## Just... please don't go to the movies when theaters re-open, OK?

Summary of [original article](https://mashable.com/article/movie-theaters-shouldnt-be-reopening-covid-19-pandemic/):

> Movie theaters are preparing to re-open right now in the midst of a global pandemic that's spun out of control in the United States. Are movie theaters really the best home for them when places like schools and government offices also need them? Every bit of evidence out there on COVID-19 suggests that movie theaters are danger zones.

`/u/NickDanger3di` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/iavo36/just_please_dont_go_to_the_movies_when_theaters/):

> In the many decades prior to covid, I've changed seats in a theater many times, just to get away from some coughing, slobbering, sneezing asshole who didn't have the common sense to stay tf home while sick. I am *not* going anywhere near a movie theater again until I'm vaccinated.
