## Virus ‘far more dangerous’ now as Colorado COVID-19 spike sets alarming records

Summary of [original article](http://www.uchealth.org/today/virus-far-more-dangerous-now-as-colorado-covid-19-spike-sets-alarming-records/?mobile=1/):

> Colorado is shattering daily records for COVID-19 infections while hospitalizations have soared to the highest levels since the worst peaks of the pandemic, prompting stern pleas from Colorado's governor and medical experts urging people to wear masks and sharply limit social interactions. "The virus is far more dangerous now than in the summer. People are exhausted so they're hanging out with neighbors and friends," said Dr. Richard Zane, executive director of emergency services at UCHeath University of Colorado Hospital, and UCHealth's Chief Innovation Officer. About 15-to-20% of people with COVID-19 who need hospital care at UCHealth and elsewhere around the state now are people ages 20 to 39.
