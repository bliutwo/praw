> Kids are great and all, but there is nothing more dirty and germ ridden as a kid.  It's not their fault, they're just kids, but you can't ask them to be careful and not spread anything because, once again, they're just kids.

`/u/autofill34` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ir1vd5/persistent_lung_damage_improves_gradually_after/):

> Lots of redditMDs scoffing at the idea that lungs can ever have permanent damage 
> 
> Look a lot of people are recovering but this is new and the outcomes of a lot of patients are still unknown. Some people have permanent damage, some don't. And we're not exactly sure which is which until enough people recover which is why these studies are important. It's not "obvious" at all. This is a very strange virus, it's not like other girls.

Summary of [original article](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/he-swept-me-off-my-feet-lee-county-firefighter-dies-of-covid-19-before-wedding-day/19281457/):

> One North Carolina family gives a glimpse of what might have been for a firefighter in Lee County - one of the thousands who have died. In a statement on Friday, the Lemon Springs Volunteer Fire Department joined others in expressing sadness over Reed's death. "Herman Reed was a faithful and dedicated member of the Lemon Springs Volunteer Fire Department for ten years and four months. In his time on the fire department, he served the community selflessly and courageously, always there to lend a helping hand to his fellow fire department family and to the community he cherished so much. Firefighter Reed always had a smile on his face and would ensure that anyone around him would as well. He was a man that never met a stranger and could get along with anyone. Firefighter Reed will truly be missed by the Lemon Springs Volunteer Fire Department."
