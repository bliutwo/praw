## FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/owyf0w/faq_recent_cdc_guidance_vaccine_data_and_the/):

> Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.

> MONTGOMERY, Ala. - Since the pandemic began, just 26 of the 11,600 people in Alabama who have died of COVID-19 were fully vaccinated, State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday. There were about 3,000 COVID-19 patients in state hospitals at the peak of the pandemic, and health officials have expressed concern that the state could be quickly headed back to that number. The state ranks last for the percentage of people fully vaccinated with 34%. In Alabama, 44% of people have received at least one dose of vaccine, a figure that ranks the state fifth from last.

## So Much For 'Hot Vax Summer.' Delta Puts A Damper On Festivals And Concerts

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/06/1025203349/covid-19-delta-lollapalooza-music-concert-festival):

> Delta Variant Puts A Damper On Summer Festivals And Concerts As summer festivals and massive concerts returned this month amid the promise of "Hot vax summer," the surge in the delta variant has disrupted plans for carefree live music. For live music fans, what was supposed to be "Hot vax summer" has begun to feel more like "Delta variant downer." The recent COVID-19 surges around the country are putting a damper on the joys of finally experiencing live music again even as major festivals and concerts return. Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding believes "Music festivals and concerts are risky," he writes in an email to NPR, "Mostly because of the ... indoor gatherings after hours and crowded bathrooms."

> So pissed at all you antivaxxers. It could have been one hell of a good summer.
