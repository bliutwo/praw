> Obligatory sticky: I am not qualified to give medical advice. I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

## Every second person in Germany has been vaccinated at least once! [German]

Summary of [original article](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/jens-spahn-jeder-zweite-in-deutschland-hat-mindestens-einmal-corona-impfung-erhalten):

> Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn ist mit der Entwicklung der Impfkampagne zufrieden: Mit 50,1 Prozent sei mittlerweile mehr als die Hälfte der Bevölkerung in Deutschland mindestens einmal gegen Covid-19 geimpft. Die Frage sei nicht, ob die Variante die dominierende werde, sondern nur wann und unter welchen Bedingungen, betonte Gesundheitsminister Spahn. Auch wenn bereits die Hälfte der deutschen Bevölkerung einmal geimpft sei: Die restlichen Menschen seien immer noch nicht geschützt, sagte Wieler mit Blick auf Erkenntnisse aus Großbritannien, wonach nur vollständig geimpfte Menschen vor schweren Verläufen nach einer Infektion mit der Delta-Variante geschützt sind.

## The same mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines could help treat cancer

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/06/19/covid-19-vaccine-mrna-tech-cure-cancer-tumors/7711271002/):

> Companies like Moderna and Pfizer's partner BioNTech, whose names are familiar from COVID-19 vaccines, are using mRNA to spur cancer patients' bodies to make vaccines that will - hopefully - prevent recurrences and treatments designed to fight off advanced tumors. At the moment, most of the mRNA cancer vaccine trials are targeting tumors such as melanoma and kidney cancer, where drugs called checkpoint inhibitors have already made a significant difference for many patients. Mutated cancer cells have proteins on their surface that can be targeted by an mRNA vaccine.

`/u/German_Granpa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3dmsc/the_same_mrna_technology_used_in_covid19_vaccines/):

> Article wins "Most uninspired piece of the year" award.
> 
> The entire purpose for Sahin and his firm BioNTech to create this mRNA technology was cancer treatment. The entire COVID situation with re-purposing this technology for vaccines is just a lucky coincidence.
> 
> In related news .... the oven mittens you use in the cold can also be used to touch hot stuff without burning your hands.

## Needle phobia could be the cause of 10% of COVID vaccine hesitancy in the UK

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/needle-phobia-could-be-the-cause-of-10-of-covid-vaccine-hesitancy-in-the-uk-new-research-162678):

> Because needle phobia is a highly plausible cause of instances of hesitancy, what this suggests is that if we could wave a magic wand and rid people of their injection anxiety, just over 10% of instances of vaccine hesitancy might disappear too. Vaccine hesitancy tends to be a little higher among younger people and certain ethnic minority groups. Though they're certainly not the main factor, OCEANS-III suggests that injection fears partially account for higher rates of vaccine hesitancy in these demographic groups.

`/u/pancakesiguess` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o2q5u0/needle_phobia_could_be_the_cause_of_10_of_covid/):

> My wife is TERRIFIED of needles and I went with her to hold her hand while she got her shot. The doctors both times were amazing and very very compassionate and understanding of her fear, especially the second one. He told her to look away (she put her head into my chest) and then said "okay do you want me to give you a countdown, or do you want me.... and there, all done!" She didn't even feel herself get the shot and got a Magikarp bandaid.

## Fast-Spreading COVID-19 Delta Variant Reported In Florida

Summary of [original article](https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2021-06-18/fast-spreading-covid-19-delta-variant-reported-in-florida):

> The highly aggressive Delta variant, first detected in India, has surfaced in Florida, just as national leaders warn it could soon become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID tracker shows Florida has at least 72 cases of the variant as of June 15, Cindy Krischer Goodman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. Federal health officials have labeled Delta a "Variant of concern," a designation given to strains that show evidence of increased transmissibility or that cause a more severe disease. 617.2, is considered more likely to cause severe illness in unvaccinated people - symptoms develop more quickly and viral loads climb faster than in people infected with other variants.

`/u/Studentdoctor563` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o2wfyl/fastspreading_covid19_delta_variant_reported_in/):

> “The variant is considered more likely to cause severe illness in unvaccinated people.”

## U.S. triples vaccines for Taiwan with 2.5 million-dose shipment

Summary of [original article](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/health-pmn/u-s-triples-vaccines-for-taiwan-with-2-5-million-dose-shipment):

> "Our vaccines do not come with strings attached," the official said, adding Taiwan had "Faced unfair challenges in its efforts to acquire vaccines on the global marketplace." A deal for Taiwan to purchase vaccines from Germany's BioNTech SE fell through this year, with Taiwan's government blaming pressure from Beijing. China has denied the accusation, saying Taiwan is free to obtain the vaccines through Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd, which has a contract to sell BioNTech's vaccine in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

`/u/bfwolf1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3femm/us_triples_vaccines_for_taiwan_with_25/):

> Wow, 2.5M doses fit on one plane?
