"In one of his videos aired June 11 on his hermancain.com blog, Cain said:"We must continue to spread the coronavirus message: social distancing, sanitizing, hand-washing and masks.

## Houston doctor behind hydroxychloroquine drug video was sued in Louisiana woman’s death

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/houston-doctor-drug-viral-video-sued-louisiana-15443105.php):

> Court filings reviewed by the Houston Chronicle also reveal she was recently sued in Louisiana for medical malpractice in a case involving a woman who died after being treated in Immanuel's care. Among Immanuel's claims in the hydroxychloroquine video is that she has treated more than 350 patients with the antimalarial drug and not one person has died. Religion plays a role in her medical practice, Immanuel suggested in an April video - the first post to be shared to the Rehoboth Medical Center's Facebook page.
