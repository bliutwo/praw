## Misinformation is bad. Good information is good.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/):

> Here are some good sources of information about COVID-19 that are written to be accessible to the general public. For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

> The moderators of this sub support efforts to more strongly combat COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit. We believe our sub is one of the best places on Reddit, and maybe the internet, to get accurate and timely information on the pandemic, and we take a strong stance against misinformation. In our opinion, it would be counterproductive to make one of the most accurate subs on Reddit private in order to combat misinformation on Reddit. If you would like to discuss the current happenings in regards to subs going private, please do so on this sticky. Feel free to share this post with others who are seeking accurate information.

## In Mississippi, Fetal Deaths Double Among Unvaccinated Pregnant Women With COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/15715/in-mississippi-fetal-deaths-double-among-unvaccinated-pregnant-women-with-covid-19/):

> Fetal deaths have doubled among unvaccinated pregnant women who suffer COVID-19 infections, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a Mississippi State Department of Health press conference today. Dr. Dobbs revealed the statistic on fetal deaths hours after MSDH reported the state's first known COVID-19 death involving an infant. MSDH does not release other identifying information on pediatric deaths, but Dr. Byers told the Mississippi Free Press today that the department will consider releasing racial demographics on child COVID deaths.

## The U.S. is falling to the lowest vaccination rates of the worldâ€™s wealthiest democracies.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/us-vaccination-rate-low.html):

> For the moment, the United States retains a slightly larger percentage of fully vaccinated people than Japan, 52.76 percent compared to 50.04 percent, according to Our World in Data, ranking sixth out of the Group of 7 nations, after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy. The United States appears all but certain to fall to last place among the Group of 7 nations shortly, given the rapid pace of achieving full vaccinations in Japan and the extremely slow rate in the United States. Between July 24 and Sept. 9, the full vaccination rate in the United States grew by around 4 percent, while in the same period Japan lifted its level by 25 percent, a jump that doubled the size of its fully vaccinated population.

> I wouldn't be surprised if the same people not getting the vaccines are the ones that the ones obsessed with nationalism and patriotism, yet they wouldn't take a simple jab to protect their fellow citizens.

## Covid-19 spike protein binds to and changes cells in the heart

Summary of [original article](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2021/august/covid-19-spike-protein-binds-to-and-changes-cells-in-the-heart):

> The spike protein found on the surface of Covid-19 virus cells causes changes to cells in the small blood vessels of the heart, according to research we funded presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress. Researchers from the University of Bristol have found that the spike protein binds to cells called pericytes which line the small vessels of the heart. Researchers took small vessel cells from the heart and exposed them to the spike protein.

> 
> Researchers from the University of Bristol have found that the spike protein binds to cells called pericytes which line the small vessels of the heart. This binding triggers a cascade of changes which disrupt normal cell function, and lead to the release of chemicals that cause inflammation. This happened even when the protein was no-longer attached to the virus.

## More Public School Students Are Getting COVID In Texas As Fights Over Masks Ensue

> As a Texas teacher, let me try and explain what happens step-by-step when a kid gets COVID:
> 
> * The kid is out for a day or two with no explanation.
> 
> * Our grade level gets called to the front office after school to inform us of another exposure. Originally we had to contact-trace and figure out who was within the student for 15+ minutes in a space of six feet or less, but our spread was so great regardless of this that they have just decided to count the whole grade as a close contact.
> 
> * That afternoon/evening, parents get a close contact exposure letter written in legalese that some of them cannot understand.
> 
> * The following day, anywhere between a quarter and half of the class is out because of the COVID scare. They will continue to be out for several days until they can get a test. If any of them test positive, go back to Step One.
> 
> * The student out with COVID will be out for two weeks if not more.
> 
> * All students who are out will fall well behind in their classes. We have work they can do online, but it does not compare to the work done in-class. We do not have the time to teach virtually and in-person at the same time. We do not have dedicated virtual teachers because the state defunded virtual ed for the year in an effort to make everything look normal; they have since re-instated *some* funding, but it's only for up to 10% of kids in the district (and most districts only let kids enroll/unenroll from virtual at the start of a grading period--it's not something kids can hop on while they're out). All of this is without mentioning the fact that kids who are legitimately sick *should not* be working and should be focused on getting well.
> 
> * When the students return, we are often miles ahead of where they were when they left because of the ridiculous pacing guides the state and district are making us adhere to in order to compensate for "learning loss".
> 
> * We do not have the time we need to get these students caught up, so they fall further behind. I would love nothing more than to be able to meet with these students in small groups to get them caught up--but I cannot. A new state law demands that we meet with small groups of students who did not pass the STAAR (state end-of-year test) at least one hour a week for every subject they did not pass the test in last year. These groups are legally required to be less than three kids. A ton of kids did not pass the test last year, either because they were already behind or (most infuriatingly) because we were told last year that STAAR would not count AND that students who were virtual last year did not have to take STAAR. We are also legally barred from using recess, lunch, or specials time to have these small group sessions. Unsurprisingly, this large number of students meets the poorly-designed legal framework and creates a massive hullabaloo.
> 
> * Therefore, the vast majority of our class time is spent meeting with groups of 3 or less for roughly 15 minutes apiece in an effort to fit as many students in as possible each day so they can all get their minutes by the end of the week and we will be in legal compliance as a school. This is interspersed with extremely brief bursts of highly-accelerated whole group instruction at a pace many of the kids are very uncomfortable with even if they *aren't* missing two or three days of school randomly every other week. Those who *are* absent fall further and further behind.
> 
> * While all of this is going on, our school board meetings are growing increasingly erratic and violent as anti-maskers (many of whom do not even live in our districts) flood the meetings en masse screaming about oxygen deprivation, vaccine conspiracies, and freedoms. Several districts have acquiesced to them, only to see a spike in cases afterward--and the further perpetuation of the cycle. And now the state AG is suing several districts with mask mandates in an attempt to overturn them...
> 
> The whole thing is a completely unsustainable mess, and I guarantee despite all of the "effort" test scores are still going to be ridiculously low at the end of the year. To this end, teachers and schools will largely be blamed, and the state government will turn around and say "See, we told you public schools don't work, it's time to privatize everything."

## NY hospital to pause baby deliveries after staffers quit over vaccine mandate

Summary of [original article](https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/ny-hospital-pause-baby-deliveries-after-staffers-quit-over-vaccine-mandate/NNMBMQ6VTFFT5DDAMXV46DQ5TQ/):

> By. Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk.LOWVILLE, N.Y. - An upstate New York hospital said it will pause the delivery of babies in two weeks because of a spate of resignations by maternity unit workers who are objecting to COVID-19 vaccination mandates. During a news conference Friday afternoon, Lewis County Health System CEO Gerald Cayer said seven of the 30 hospital workers who resigned were from the hospital's maternity ward. Cayer said 165 hospital employees, or 27% of the facility's workforce, have yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, WWNY reported.
