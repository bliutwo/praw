## Idaho lieutenant governor appears in video that claims pandemic ‘may or may not be occurring’

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/30/idaho-covid-lieutenant-governor/):

> The video shows Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin sitting in the driver's seat of a pickup truck, a Bible in her hand, as she rails against the coronavirus restrictions carried out in the state she helps lead."We recognize that all of us are by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights," she says, grabbing a gun and placing it on top of the Bible with a wide smile on her face. After Little ordered bars to stay closed until mid-June, McGeachin defied the directive and reopened her family's Idaho Falls tavern weeks before the order lifted. The following day, the Idaho Freedom Foundation released a video of elected officials reciting a "Declaration to Idaho residents and officials" that it had published on its website earlier this month.
