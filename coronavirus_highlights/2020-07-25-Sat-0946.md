> 
> She came home the other night crying that she delivered three dead babies in two days. She used to go a month or more between stillbirths.
> 
> EDIT since this has taken off: my wife, myself, and possibly our 2 year old daughter got COVID in late Feb/early March. It sucks. Please wear a mask.

> The family lives paycheck-to-paycheck and Diaz's mother quit her job as a housekeeper to care for her grandchildren. A family friend created a GoFundMe page for the family. "At least, since he passed, we get to be with our family," Isaiah Garcia told CNN affiliate KTRK. "We don't have to go to an orphanage or anything. I'd rather be here than anywhere else right now."

## Leaving Your Nose Uncovered Defeats the Purpose of Wearing a Mask: Study Reveals

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/leaving-your-nose-uncovered-defeats-the-purpose-of-wearing-a-mask/2412189/):

> You have no doubt seen plenty of people in public with their mask pulled down so it only covers their mouth, leaving their nose exposed. Just like the nose is better for breathing, the nose also appears to be better at spreading COVID-19. In order to block that infectious cloud from escaping to infect other people, it's just as important to cover your nose with a mask.

## To stop the spread of Covid-19, the USA must change its testing strategy from the current method of infrequent PCR testing to frequent rapid testing

Summary of [original article](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2):

`/u/bontesla` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hxmb4k/to_stop_the_spread_of_covid19_the_usa_must_change/):

> The article calls for both testing and isolating the infected.
> 
> This is also the feedback China has given a lot of other countries. They could not contain the virus until they built a quarantine center for mild and asymptomatic patients.
> 
> China was finding that instructions to quarantine at home were both ineffective and dangerous. First, people break quarantine when they think they can get away with it. A quarantine center was enforceable in ways that voluntary self quarantine isn't.
> 
> Also, forcing people to quarantine at home permitted the virus to infect everyone in that household. A point that seems obvious but one that the US is still struggling with. Especially in areas of Texas where patients with a poor prognosis are sent home to die.
> 
> China also implemented targeted and strict lockdown orders and this was a critical part of their success.
> 
> The US needs to lockdown in addition to getting a handle on testing and quarantining the positive cases. But our politicians have no interest in doing so. Neither party is united in calling for lockdowns. They're calling for masks.
> 
> And a lockdown, at this point, would require Congress bailing states out financially. The House bill provides aid but not sufficient for a lockdown, because, again, neither party is calling for a lockdown.
