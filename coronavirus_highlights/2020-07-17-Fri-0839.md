> "Essentially, OSHA is AWOL," said David Michaels, a former head of OSHA under the Obama administration who now teaches at George Washington University's school of public health. "The OSHA response to this crisis has been horrible. There's been more complaints filed with OSHA in the past four months than any previous four months," said Peter Dooley, a certified industrial hygienist with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, a federation of private, non-profit coalitions that advocates for worker health and safety. Overall, OSHA had received 208 COVID-19 related complaints and opened 19 inspections in Florida as of June 24, a spokesperson said.

## Dr. Fauci Says, “With All Due Modesty, I Think I’m Pretty Effective.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.instyle.com/news/dr-fauci-says-with-all-due-modesty-i-think-im-pretty-effective):

> NO: I guess I'll start with the coronavirus task force! [laughs]. NO: What do you think some of the ethical issues are with COVID-19 that we are going to have to focus on? Starting with the issues around what do you do when a hospital gets to capacity and has no more beds or no more equipment? What do you do for health-care workers when they don't have adequate PPE and are putting themselves at risk? Issues around end-of-life care for people who are dying alone and there are no visitors allowed and no extra support for them.

## "This is real": Doctors, nurses who helped with New York epidemic warn their home states

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/real-doctors-nurses-who-helped-new-york-coronavirus-surge-warn-n1234060):

> Medical professionals from across the country rushed to New York City when it became the center of the pandemic in the U.S. in March and April, but now they are alarmed by what they're seeing in their own backyards as their home states report record numbers of cases. Almost 1 in 5 new cases of the coronavirus reported around the world one day this week came from just three U.S. states - Texas, Florida and California - an NBC News tally revealed Tuesday. In response to the comment, Melissa DeRosa, secretary to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, asked on Twitter: "How could the rest of America have watched what happened in New York in March and let this happen in July?".Jess Esperti, a nurse from Arizona who also treated patients at Elmhurst Hospital in April, said the hardest part was that so many patients were dying that there wasn't always enough time to inform family members or let them grieve."New York was such a whirlwind, because we didn't have time to do that with our patients," said Esperti, who works for several Phoenix-area hospitals.
