## Misinformation is bad. Good information is good.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/):

> Here are some good sources of information about COVID-19 that are written to be accessible to the general public. For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

> The moderators of this sub support efforts to more strongly combat COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit. We believe our sub is one of the best places on Reddit, and maybe the internet, to get accurate and timely information on the pandemic, and we take a strong stance against misinformation. In our opinion, it would be counterproductive to make one of the most accurate subs on Reddit private in order to combat misinformation on Reddit. If you would like to discuss the current happenings in regards to subs going private, please do so on this sticky. Feel free to share this post with others who are seeking accurate information. All other meta-drama comments will be removed. Thanks!

## In Portugal "88 % of eligible population fully vaccinated against covid", 98% with atleast the first shot. [translation of the article in the comments]

Summary of [original article](https://www.dn.pt/edicao-do-dia/07-set-2021/88-da-populacao-elegivel-totalmente-vacinada-contra-a-covid-14095411.html):

> No grupo etário dos 50 aos 64 anos, a percentagem de totalmente vacinados  de 92%. E chega aos 99% nos que têm 65 e mais anos de idade, segundo o último relatório da vacinação da DGS.Números tendem a estabilizar. O virologista Pedro Simas sublinha que foi o Governo decidir a meta de 85% da população totalmente vacina para se atingir a imunidade de grupo, não concordando que não se tenha passado para a abertura geral. "Foram criticados, mas o risco pandémico já tinha desaparecido. Portugal entrou numa fase endémica da covid-19, o número de novos casos diários não vai baixar muito mais. E, a partir dos 60% da população vacinada, a partir do momento em que os grupos de risco estão vacinados, diminui exponencialmente as consequências graves da doença. E  bom que o coronavírus circule entre a população vacinada, uma vez que aumenta a imunidade", explica o cientista do Instituto de Medicina Molecular.

> Wow!

> we should monitor Portugal (and Spain too) and compare their cases and hospitalizations vs Israel. It'd be interesting to see how a very high uptake of 2-dose regime fair against Delta.

> I think parents have their heads buried in the sand when they think about school precautions. I’d argue the risk has at least doubled since last spring. Delta, double the amount of students, pandemic fatigue, mask fatigue, room sharing, full schedules, community spread, etc. 
> 
> There’s definitely an argument to be made that online learning failed a lot of students last year. Hopefully we haven’t swung the pendulum to the opposite extreme and fail them again with a desire for normalcy when the situation on the ground still seems anything but normal.

The state health department on Aug. 29 recorded 51,904 COVID cases among Texas students since the 2021-22 school year began. Texas Children's faces a "High plateau" of kids battling the virus, with roughly 50 COVID patients receiving treatment on a given day, he said.

## Israeli experts analyze mRNA COVID vaccines long-term effects

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/israeli-experts-analyze-if-mrna-covid-vaccines-be-dangerous-in-long-term-678171):

> While traditional vaccines generally put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mRNA vaccines "Teach our cells how to make a protein - or even just a piece of a protein - that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies." While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first mRNA ones to ever be brought to market for human patients, Linial said she believes the reason that no mRNA vaccine has been developed until now is because there was just no need to move this fast on a vaccine until COVID-19 came along. Leshem said mRNA vaccines for other diseases, including cancer, have been tested in humans for around 10 years and "No long-term effects were registered" in those trials - though he admitted that these trials generally included small numbers of participants.

`/u/actioncomicbible` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjm4sb/israeli_experts_analyze_mrna_covid_vaccines/):

> I think this is good to keep studying these even if in the end of the day it ends up saying, "Water causes you to be wet". I mean shit, I'm dealing with my relative who says, "DURRR WE'RE IN PHASE 1 TESTING OF THE mRNA VACCINE" and it's frustrating to constantly explain the nuance to a sped-up testing timeline and how this "new tech" isn't that new at all. 
> 
> IF we can get more and more data to stress the point that these vaccines are safe, especially in the long run, then maybe the vaxx-hesitant can stop being so hesitant and finally get vaxxed. 
> 
> Sidenote: with the mRNA vaxx tech, I really really hope the alzheimer's vaccine and the cancer vaccine end up being successful. Lost my dad to cancer and alzheimer's is a personal hellscape nightmare of mine; I would be first in line to get these.

> Don’t they know they’re killing their own supporters. What’s the endgame for all this? I live in FL, and am used to desantis’s antics, but like what do u gain at this point from banning masks? Your base already stans you, instead of killing them off maybe subtly try to help them…
> 
> Whatever in the scheme of things it doesn’t matter, maybe enough Florida votes blue in 2022 and 24 and I don’t have to deal with a batshit crazy governor.
