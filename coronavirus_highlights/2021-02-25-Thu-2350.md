## Johnson & Johnson one-shot vaccine appears to fare better against worrisome COVID-19 variants than first reported

Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/24/nation/jj-one-shot-vaccine-appears-fare-better-against-worrisome-covid-19-strains-than-first-reported/):

> "We can talk about all the fine differences between these vaccines, but the most important message is that all of these vaccines are highly safe and highly effective, and all these vaccines are going to save lives," said Dr. Dan Barouch, head of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel, which licensed vaccine technology to Johnson & Johnson. A single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine not only protected recipients against illness, it also appeared to prevent some asymptomatic infections, which many experts believe have fueled the epidemic. When the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets Friday, Johnson & Johnson will almost certainly tout the data showing its vaccine has the highest proven efficacy against variants.

> It is so hard to compare these results with the mRNA ones. Do these studies have more young people or less? What does it mean "serious illness"? Can people still spread the disease even vaccinated? Can they test the amount of antibodies generated?

## We Need to Prepare for the Possibility That Something Good Might Happen

Summary of [original article](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35614976/covid-19-vaccines-good-news-variants/):

> The early indications are that the J&J vaccine remains effective against the New Variants, including the South African strain, which have caused so much alarm in the scientific community and especially The Media. Over and over again media reports on the vaccines have seized on the lack of data on transmission from the vaccine trials-the initial ones just didn't look at it-to leave the reader or viewer with the impression that the vaccines will not affect transmission. A Washington Post article this month discussed the likelihood that "Over the long term, the novel coronavirus will become a persistent disease threat, albeit one that could eventually end up closer to the flu or the common cold." Later, it explained that, despite the news that the AstraZeneca vaccine did not fully prevent mild or moderate cases of the South African variant, "The crisis phase of the pandemic will recede. A world with the novel coronavirus will feel markedly different as the threat of death or hospitalization diminishes-even if the possibility of a few days of sore throat, cough and fever remains."

> > The coverage should emphasize that the threat remains, but that if we get a lot of people vaccinated quickly, we can get out of this.
> > 
> > Why so much of it does not reflect this is a more difficult question. There is the basic issue that good news doesn't make for good news. Bad stuff makes better headlines. There is less coverage, for instance, of falling cases than rising cases. But it might be time for many of us to assess whether we've developed a kind of Stockholm Syndrome relationship with negative information. Are we addicted to bad news?
> 
> I think it's more than just being addicted to bad news. There is the feeling that the pandemic has been so bad for so many people that seeming to enjoy good news is somehow inherently evil. Like you are a traitor to the cause of justice if you believe good things are not only possible but likely coming soon.

## Vaccination tiers may be phased out soon as supply increases across the country, L.A. Mayor Garcetti says

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/mayor-garcetti-holds-coronavirus-briefing-as-l-a-vaccination-sites-reopen/):

> While COVID-19 vaccine supply remains scarce, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that there could soon be enough doses for everyone, leading to a phasing out of the tiered system. The mayor's briefing comes after vaccination sites reopened across the city Tuesday following temporary closures due to weather-related shipment delays. The city is expanding the number of mobile vaccination clinics in communities hit hardest by the pandemic, and is now offering Saturday hours to accommodate more people who work Monday to Friday, Garcetti said.

`/u/Cactus_Interactus` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lsi3e8/vaccination_tiers_may_be_phased_out_soon_as/):

> Answer to the obvious first question, how soon is "soon" according to the mayor
> 
> >“I look forward to the day, and I think it’s coming sooner than we can imagine — in a month, month and a half, maybe two months max — where I think all of these tiers basically go away, because we’re gonna have so much vaccine supply in this country,” he said.
