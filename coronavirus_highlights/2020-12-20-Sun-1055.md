Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-in-tier-4-everybody-needs-to-behave-as-if-they-already-have-coronavirus-matt-hancock-says-12168124):

> The new strain of COVID-19 is out of control and people need to behave as if they already have the virus, especially in the new Tier 4 areas of England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned. Mr Hancock said cases have "Rocketed" during the last few days and warned keeping the new variant under control until a vaccine has been rolled out would be "Very difficult". British Medical Association council chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said the planned five-day Christmas relaxation had not followed the science on the new variant, which he said "Was spreading week-on-week" when the five-day rules were announced by the PM. He told Ridge: "Last Wednesday, before the new variant was announced, it was obvious that the infection was spreading at a dangerous level, the NHS was in a dangerous state."

## Coronavirus face masks that end up in the sea will take 450 years to degrade, marine conservation group warns

Summary of [original article](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3113367/covid-19-face-masks-end-sea-will-take-450-years-degrade):

> A Hong Kong-based marine conservation organisation says single-use surgical masks pose a huge environmental threat, estimating 1.56 billion will have entered the oceans in 2020.In a report released this week, OceansAsia says discarded face masks will result in an additional 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of marine plastic pollution. Titled "Masks on the Beach: The Impact of Covid-19 on Marine Plastic Pollution" the report says masks will take up to 450 years to break down, and have a negative impact on marine wildlife and ecosystems. The report used a global production estimate of 52 billion masks being made in 2020, a conservative loss rate of three per cent, and the average weight of three to four grams for a single-use polypropylene surgical face mask to arrive at the estimate.

## Anthony Fauci Vaccinated Santa Claus, He Said On CNN

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/anthony-fauci-santa-covid-vaccine):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci personally traveled to the North Pole to vaccinate Santa Claus from the coronavirus, he said on CNN Saturday morning, in a claim that BuzzFeed News cannot verify but certainly believes. In a very cute segment on CNN geared towards teaching children about COVID-19, Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, addressed questions from kids about whether Santa got the vaccine and if it was safe for him to visit them on Christmas and deliver presents. "So what I did a little while ago, I took a trip up there to the North Pole. I went there and I vaccinated Santa Claus myself. I measured his level of immunity, and he is good to go. He can come down the chimney, he can leave the presents, he can leave and you have nothing to worry about. Santa Claus is good to go."

> More people believe in Santa than COVID. It’s true...I did no research

> The guy that died, and infected this poor man, should never have been flying in the first place. He felt sick. Lied on the questionnaire, and now more people are sick because he was too selfish, and got on a plane so he could get home faster.
