> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

> >  But the Pfizer vaccine is relatively unusual as it has to be stored and transported at an ultracold temperature of around -94 Fahrenheit (-70 Celsius), significantly complicating the process of getting the vaccine to people.

> EDIT #1:  Oh the hate I'm getting ...  I posted the above [quote from the story on the same page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/09/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/#link-LQXMGAA6LVBYRBHUZ5Y3G4EHOE), because it was something new to me, and I hadn't considered temperature in the logistics of delivering millions of doses of a vaccine.  I also hadn't considered that with some vaccines, multiple doses may be required.  I was not aiming to spread doom-and-gloom, rather I was trying to share new (to me) knowledge.  I think the best comment so far has been, "I'm sure they'll figure something out".  Indeed, I expect that will happen.

Summary of [original article](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-mental-illness/one-in-five-covid-19-patients-develop-mental-illness-within-90-days-study-idUKKBN27P34P):

> 3 Min Read.LONDON - Many COVID-19 survivors are likely to be at greater risk of developing mental illness, psychiatrists said on Monday, after a large study found 20% of those infected with the coronavirus are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within 90 days. Anxiety, depression and insomnia were most common among recovered COVID-19 patients in the study who developed mental health problems, and the researchers also found significantly higher risks of dementia, a brain impairment condition. The study also found that people with a pre-existing mental illness were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 than those without.
