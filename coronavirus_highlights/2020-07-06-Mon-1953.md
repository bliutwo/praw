## Requiring face masks to be worn decreases the growth rate of COVID-19 cases by about 40% in Germany

Summary of [original article](https://voxeu.org/article/unmasked-effect-face-masks-spread-covid-19):

> Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases? Yes, we can. In summary, the introduction of mandatory face masks has slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in Germany.

> >The US response has been extraordinarily disappointing and wrongheaded," he told me via Zoom, at the end of June. "Whenever there's been an opportunity to do the right thing, we seem to have done the wrong thing.
