> That should tell you something about masks and how effective they are...and also how many lives here could have been saved if everyone just wore masks from the beginning.

## Parties — not protests — are causing spikes in coronavirus - NPR - Jun 25 2020

Summary of [original article](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/24/npr-what-contact-tracing-may-tell-about-cluster-spread-of-the-coronavirus):

> As the U.S. begins to open back up, coronavirus clusters - where multiple people contract COVID-19 at the same event or location - are popping up all over the country. "If you look who is staying in and following the guidelines, [it's] older people who are at risk. The older folks got ; the young people, not so much." "The concern is that because these younger people are having more mild symptoms, they are going to work sick, they are visiting with their parents and grandparents sick and they're continuing to go to social events where they expose more and more people," Lautenbach says.

> People can't not have a graduation party, it's so fucking stupid.
> 
> I keep getting these texts from my mom because it's so and so's birthday, it's memorial day, it's father's day, and she's used to being able to have a family get together. It's really difficult to constantly have to say no, it's not a good idea for the whole family to get together every two weeks! My family members don't want to wear masks or gloves or bring their own plates and sit outside when it's hot. They are all gonna use the same bathroom because what other choice is there? Then Mom is going to go in and wash the dishes at my uncle's house because that's what she normally does and change is not a thing.
> 
> People need to realize this isn't fOrEvEr  and they can miss 6 months worth of birthday parties. It's literally the dumbest way to die. How many times  do we have to hear about a *whole family* getting sick and losing a couple people because they wanted to have a graduation party or a quincinera or whatever. You don't have to have a barbecue this year! Just have them next year? Sorry but just no, family.

## 'We opened too quickly': Texas becomes a model for inadequate Covid-19 response

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/27/we-opened-too-quickly-texas-becomes-model-inadequate-coronavirus-pandemic-response):

> When Donald Trump welcomed Texas governor Greg Abbott to the White House in May, the US president hailed his fellow Republican as "One of the great governors" and lauded the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic and predicted boom times ahead."When you look at the job he's done in Texas, I rely on his judgment," Trump said. Seven weeks later, as the state once again closes businesses with virus cases skyrocketing and hospitals running out of intensive-care beds, Texas indeed appears to be a model: for how to squander a hopeful position through premature reopening, ignoring inconvenient data and fighting party-political turf wars. Republicans control Texas politics at state level largely thanks to support from white rural and suburban voters.

> If only we had some kind of central guiding organization, so that every state could have access to the medical and scientific expertise needed to respond rationally to this crisis.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent):

> Health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better. We talked to UC San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford, MD, and infectious disease specialist Peter Chin-Hong, MD, about the CDC's reversal on mask-wearing, the current science on how masks work, and what to consider when choosing a mask. How many people need to wear masks to reduce community transmission?
