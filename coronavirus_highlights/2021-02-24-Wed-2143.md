## Help us compile a list of vaccine-finding resources!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqlg2c/help_us_compile_a_list_of_vaccinefinding_resources/):

> The mod team is looking into compiling an organized list of vaccine-finding resources to help people locate vaccination locations, available appointments, and scheduling information to receive the COVID-19 vaccine! We're looking for any suggestions that anyone may have that can help with any of these goals! It doesn't have to be big or nationwide - we'll do our best to compile statewide or citywide resources as well. Nor does this list have to be dedicated solely to the United States - vaccine locators around the world are welcome.

`/u/Critical-Freedom` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lroog3/moderna_ready_to_begin_testing_vaccine_that/):

> This may be obvious, but should we assume that a vaccine engineered to work on the South African variant would also have high efficacy against the Brazilian variant, which shares similar mutations?
> 
> The Brazilian variant has received hardly any global attention at all, which seems very odd given that it appears to have all the scary qualities that the SA strain has, and has clearly caused havoc in Manaus.

## Exhausted by COVID-19 fight, Portuguese nurses want pay not applause

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-portugal-nurse/exhausted-by-covid-19-fight-portuguese-nurses-want-pay-not-applause-idUSKBN2AO136):

> "Otherwise, Portuguese nurses will continue to try to go to other countries where they can earn more." A 2019 OECD report said nurses' pay increased in most countries since the economic crisis, but it fell in nations like Portugal and neighbouring Spain due to public sector pay cuts, and only started to slowly recover in recent years. Last year, a total of 1,230 nurses asked the Nurses' Order for the paperwork to be able to work abroad.In January, the government approved temporary measures to support the health service, including a 50% bonus on overtime payment for those on the frontline and gave the SNS the possibility to hire more nurses and doctors.
