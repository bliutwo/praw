> Cue the highlight reel: me pleading with my family members to stay home, trying to explain that it effects us all when they take a risk. Then the subsequent shaming I receive when I say I don't feel comfortable coming over to their homes anymore.

## Physical distancing and good hand hygiene: Australian flu cases drop by more than 99%

Summary of [original article](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/physical-distancing-and-good-hand-hygiene-australi):

> The major disparity follows a trend that has seen a massive decrease in cases since social distancing measures were implemented across Australia in response to the coronavirus. This was followed by an even more dramatic 98% drop in April, when only 307 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded compared to 18,691 in the corresponding period in 2019. 'Once again, Australia can be really proud of the fact that we've done what we've been told to do with regard to COVID-19.' The drop in laboratory-confirmed flu cases is matched by data in the FluTracking surveillance system, which uses crowd-sourced information from upwards of 70,000 people each week who report whether or not they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.
