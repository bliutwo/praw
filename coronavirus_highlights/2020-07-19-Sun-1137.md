## Gasping, afraid and alone — Would we take the pandemic more seriously if we understood what it’s like to die a COVID-19 death?

Summary of [original article](http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=f185f8b6-a887-4ed2-b60b-d93097bff162):

> "We have people that are sitting in bed and they're breathing like they're running a marathon at full speed," said Dr. Adupa Rao, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist at Keck Hospital of USC."They're breathing so fast and so deep, they're trying to catch their breath," Rao said. Of the seven patients, two were in their 20s and the other five were in their 30s to 60s.Rao said he also had six or seven COVID patients in somewhat less critical condition. Rao, who is also a cystic fibrosis specialist, said a shorter life expectancy for people with that disease helps prepare patients and families somewhat for death.

> And if they catch it, it was because god wanted it (so nobody could do anything anyway).
> 
> And if they die from it, it was because god wanted it (so nobody could do anything anyway).

> There's also the denials who still think it's a hoax so it would be pointless to make them know since they won't believe it anyway.
> 
> And we can go on, with each of the covid-unintelligent-people there are in the country. So long story short: no. You wouldn't. (God I swear the bot is stupid sometimes)

## ‘Come see what we see’: Mississippi doctors decry virus denials, conspiracies as cases surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-surge-brings-suffering-impoverished-underresourced-mississippi-delta-n1234098):

> Medical institutions in Mississippi have long seen a staffing shortfall, especially with nurses, even prior to the pandemic. Only about 40 percent of Mississippi's more than 51,000 registered nurses report working in hospitals and just 15 percent are trained in critical, trauma or emergency care, according to the Mississippi Board of Nursing. Turnover at the state's hospitals and long-term care facilities was already a problem before the pandemic, and it has only continued to grow in Mississippi since the virus has spread, said Kim Hoover, a registered nurse who now works as the chief operating officer of the hospital association.

> 
> Trump: "Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test."
> 
> Trump continued: "We go out and we look and then on the news...you'll see 'cases are up.' Cases are up -- many of those cases shouldn't even be cases."
