> For some reason the phrasing of this statistic seems far more hard hitting and chilling than the total number of lives lost. I think the total number has now reached a point where I struggle to conceptualize what that huge number of people means to me as an individual.

## 'Don't they care?': Europeans astonished as U.S. hits 5 million cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/don-t-they-care-europeans-astonished-as-u-s-hits-5-million-cases-1.5057041):

> ROME - With confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. hitting 5 million Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the most powerful nation in the world to contain the scourge has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe. Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn't have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units. Many Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID-19 for free, unlike the American system, where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in obtaining health care.

## Bill Gates: US only country to have coronavirus 'testing insanity'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/511243-bill-gates-us-only-country-to-have-coronavirus-testing-insanity):

> Microsoft founder Bill Gates on Sunday lamented the U.S.' coronavirus "Testing insanity," which he said had caused the country to fall behind the rest of the world, much of which has begun reopening after flattening infection growth. "A variety of early missteps by the U.S. and then the political atmosphere meant that we didn't get our testing going," Gates said Sunday on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS." "It's nonsense that any sort of travel ban we did was at all beneficial. That doesn't pass the common sense test and now we've executed our lockdowns nationwide with less fidelity than other countries." Has vocally defended the U.S.' testing for the virus and repeatedly claimed that the country's numbers are only high due to the testing regimen, despite the fact that the positive percentage rate of the tests remains high as well.

> Ok, so I am an American.  Can I just say that the whole American exceptionalism is a fucking lie that can just end now?  Yeah I am drunk and I am dealing with the fact that I am going to have to hold my kids out of school while everybody is sending theirs back.
> 
> I don't know if I am crazy or everybody else is.  I have taken my child to the emergency room for respiratory distress (RSV and paraflu).  I have had a grief counselor assigned to me while my child has had a spinal tap and ice packs put on his chest.
> 
> Thankfully, my kids are all currently healthy but this bullshit has to end.  I literally cannot take this nonsense anymore.  I can't believe that this country can't demand that tests come back in a reasonable amount of time.  I know that we are driven by private healthcare providers.  But why do we have to collectively pay for tests that take more than 48 hours to come back.  You want to get paid?  Fucking deliver or get the fuck out of the way.
