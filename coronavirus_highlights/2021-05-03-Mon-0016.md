## Israel : Only 13 new COVID cases diagnosed in 24-hours, lowest in 14 months

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/only-13-new-covid-cases-diagnosed-in-24-hours-lowest-in-14-months/):

> As Israel continues its world-leading vaccination campaign, just 13 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the country on Saturday, the lowest rate in 14 months, according to Health Ministry data released Sunday. While weekend numbers are generally significantly lower due to reduced testing, the new figures still represent a relative drop, with last weekend's positivity rate at 0.5%. Of the 1,310 active cases in the country, there were 100 serious cases, including 60 people on ventilators, the Health Ministry data showed. The number of conscripts, career officers, and civilian employees of the IDF diagnosed with the disease has risen and fallen in the interim 14 months, reaching a peak in February, with over 3,000 cases.

## New Zealand Customs sacks 9 workers over refusal to get vaccinated against Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/new-zealand-customs-sacks-9-workers-over-refusal-to-get-vaccinated):

> AUCKLAND - The New Zealand authorities have sacked nine Customs workers over their refusal to be inoculated against Covid-19, including four from a single provincial port. The New Zealand government had made it mandatory from April 20 for all workers in managed isolation and quarantine facilities, as well as personnel working for government agencies at the border, to be vaccinated under its Covid-19 Public Health Response Order. The New Zealand Ministry of Health announced shortly after 10pm on Saturday night that it was decided after a rapid health assessment that flights from Western Australia to New Zealand should be paused.

> As a NZer I'm glad to hear they're off the border. Should they have been fired? [Possibly not](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/441653/covid-19-unvaccinated-workers-fired-by-customs-should-be-compensated-advocate) - maybe they could have been relocated. However given we've had a number of issues with border workers / security guards at quarantine facilities, and there's a global pandemic it makes you wonder why you'd refuse a vaccine when you're at a reasonable risk of being exposed to Covid-19.
