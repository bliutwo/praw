## Israel sees 60% drop in hospitalizations for age 60-plus 3 weeks after 1st shot

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-sees-60-drop-in-hospitalizations-for-over-60s-in-weeks-after-vaccination/):

> Attracting widespread international interest by sharing early data, Maccabi Healthcare Services reported earlier this month that it has seen a 60 percent reduction in coronavirus infections three weeks after the first shot is administered. The decrease in hospital admissions is swift after vaccination, Maccabi suggests in its latest data, finding that hospitalizations start to fall sharply from Day 18 after people receive the first shot. The new data also supports Maccabi's earlier claim of a 60% infection rate drop after three weeks, reporting that it saw the same drop with a new sample comprising only the 60-plus age group.

> 2 weeks from application....does that mean about a month until it’s being distributed? If it gets approved of course.

## U.S. passes 25 million confirmed coronavirus cases. The official tally works out to about one in every 13 people in the country, or about 7.6% of the population.

Summary of [original article](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2021/01/24/u-s-passes-25-million-confirmed-coronavirus-cases):

> The United States has now recorded 25 million coronavirus cases, reaching the threshold Saturday afternoon, according to a New York Times database. "Twenty-five million cases is an incredible scale of tragedy," said Caitlin Rivers, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who called the coronavirus pandemic one of the worst public health crises in history. Getting to 25 million took about three more weeks, after a surge that peaked at more than 300,000 recorded daily cases before retreating a bit in early January.

`/u/123bumblebee` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l3z068/us_passes_25_million_confirmed_coronavirus_cases/):

> It’s probably higher. My husband felt sick two days before I did, and then he stayed home with our kids while only I went and got tested, even though our whole family of 4 was sick. I came back positive and we just all stayed quarantined and got better together. We can’t be the only family that all got sick but only got one person tested.
