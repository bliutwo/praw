## Fauci holds up New York as model for fighting coronavirus — 'They did it correctly'

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/18/fauci-holds-up-new-york-as-model-for-fighting-coronavirus-they-did-it-correctly.html):

> Less than 1% of New Yorkers tested for the virus were positive Thursday, down from a high of more than 40%. Gov. Andrew Cuomo instituted some of the strictest reopening requirements in the country, insisting that stay-at-home orders remain in place and many businesses remain closed far longer than states that are now seeing surges such as Texas and Florida. More than 400,000 New Yorkers have been infected by the virus since the pandemic began and at least 32,463 people have died in the state. Last Sunday, Florida reported more than 15,000 new infections, more than New York during the peak of its outbreak.

> The real problem is, other states almost learned nothing from New York.

## Fauci admonishes those flouting coronavirus guidelines: 'You're part of the problem'

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/fauci-admonishes-those-flouting-coronavirus-guidelines-you-re-part-of-the-problem/ar-BB16Uk6l?li=BBnbcA1):

> Fauci admonishes those flouting coronavirus guidelines: 'You're part of the problem'. "They're not going to get very sick. They know that. So what I think is happening is that, understandably, innocently, but not correctly, the younger individuals are saying, 'Well, if I get infected, so the chances of it is that I won't even have any symptoms, so who cares?' That's a big mistake," Fauci said. Fauci emphasized how careless behavior towards the virus in younger, healthier individuals could indirectly affect someone who is more prone to a severe infection, thereby creating more problems that counter the effort to curb the spread. "So somehow, we've got to keep getting that message across. And I don't mean in the sense of blaming anybody," Fauci said, adding, "These are people that are doing this innocently and inadvertently."

> Whoa, that's a huge change.

> That makes me think death rates will definitely be lower.... until this round of infections moves on to older people, which is almost inevitable.

## Missouri Loses Access To Its Own Hospital Data Following Federal Reporting Changes

Summary of [original article](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/missouri-loses-access-its-own-hospital-data-following-federal-reporting-changes):

> The Missouri Hospital Association reports that it no longer has access to the data it uses to guide state coronavirus mitigation efforts, and Kansas officials say their hospital data may be delayed. "Missouri Hospital Association and the State of Missouri will be unable to access critical hospitalization data during the transition. While we are working to collect interim data, situational awareness will be limited," the notice on the department's website says. The hospital association will create an alternate reporting system for hospitals, according to Dillon, and plans to continue producing weekly reports, despite the uncertainty about data.

`/u/shillyshally` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/htg7g5/missouri_loses_access_to_its_own_hospital_data/):

> > “The new datasets for reporting are not identical and in several cases are ill-defined,” Dillon said. “That has complicated hospitals’ efforts.”
> 
> ...
> 
> > The Trump administration said the reporting change was needed due to reporting delays and other problems with the CDC.
> > 
> > But the move has been widely criticized for being disruptive, especially as COVID-19 infection numbers reach new highs and hospitals in some areas of the country are reaching capacity.
> > 
> > “By now, we should have a foolproof, streamlined reporting system for COVID,” Maddox said. “And this change – midstream – is not going to do anything to help our ability to fight the disease.”
> 
> As is all too common with this admin, hospitals had no advance warning of the change. This is just so frigging ridiculous. It's not that the Trump admin has done nothing to contain the virus, the Trump admin has acted to positively *spread*  the virus.

## Parents break isolation, beloved kindergarten teacher dies.

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/teacher-blames-parents-for-breaking-covid-19-restrictions-dies-of-virus-635481):

> Israeli kindergarten teacher from Petah Tikva, 64-year-old Shalva Zalfreind, passed away on Friday after contracting coronavirus, Channel 13 reported. Two weeks prior to her death, Zalfreind claimed in a Whatsapp group with her students' parents that some families are not upholding the coronavirus restrictions applied by the government, saying that "The authorities are certain about families who violated isolation or did not follow the municipality's instructions, not to send in children who have a family member in isolation in their home."Unfortunately, there were those who preferred to send the child to kindergarten out of a feeling of Israeli 'trust,' while fatally damaging an important value of 'mutual responsibility' and ' stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour' ," Zalfreind wrote. The Teachers' Union and Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Grinberg eulogized Zalfreind, saying that "Shalva was a respected and beloved teacher who educated the children of Israel from an early age.

> Parents don't care. I saw a comment on an article today where someone said - in all seriousness - that the future of the kids is more important than the health of the teachers.
