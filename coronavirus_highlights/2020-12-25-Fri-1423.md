> Burnout trauma. But people don’t care. They still refuse to take it seriously, tell us this is what we “signed up for” when we all know it’s not. If you get sick need to be hospitalized you don’t want that burned out, understaffed HCW taking care of you. But thats reality now

## In Italy, the second wave is now as deadly as the first

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/25/why-is-italy-going-thought-a-deadly-wave-again):

> The number of people dying with coronavirus in Italy in the second wave of infections has now surpassed the toll recorded in the first, a grim milestone that comes amid fresh lockdown measures. Since the virus was first detected in the country, nearly 86 percent of people who died were over 70, according to the National Institute of Health. In October, people complained that it was difficult to secure a test through state-run local health agencies, receive assistance, or report their infections.

`/u/tre3211` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kjy9c5/in_italy_the_second_wave_is_now_as_deadly_as_the/):

> The thing is as well that they're better at treating hospitalised cases now. There's a steroid that can be used which reduces fatalities by a significant fraction so it shows how bad things are that the death toll has still been exceeded.

## Dad 'woke up with Scottish accent' after six weeks in covid ventilator coma

Summary of [original article](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/dad-woke-up-scottish-accent-19517331):

> Wayne, 46, spent 11 weeks in hospital after the virus attacked his lungs, and described experiencing "Constant nightmares" while in a medically induced coma on a ventilator. Wayne, from Aintree, was a rare case that doctors took the last ditch gamble of hooking up to an ECMO machine - which takes over the function of the heart and lungs. The couple told the ECHO how even after the immediate danger faded and Wayne was brought round from his medically induced coma - there was a long road ahead. Louise described how the hospital arranged a video call with Wayne soon after he was taken off the ventilator.

## Nurses celebrating coronavirus vaccines are getting hit by anti-vaxxers on social media

Summary of [original article](https://www.pressherald.com/2020/12/24/nurses-celebrating-coronavirus-vaccines-are-being-hammered-with-anti-vax-comments-on-social-media/):

> When the first coronavirus vaccines were administered last week, many front-line health-care workers across the U.S. posted celebratory photos on social media. "There are a lot of opinions out there that are being used or sourced as factual information, just like in the elections we just had." In an October survey by the American Nurses Federation, 37% of nurses said they weren't confident the vaccines would be safe and effective. The group asked volunteers to report vaccine misinformation to social media companies in the fall; out of 912 posts flagged as problematic, less than 5% were removed.

Summary of [original article](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/24/in-n-out-burger-covid-outbreaks-colorado/):

> In-N-Out Burger's two newly opened Colorado restaurants each have active COVID-19 outbreaks with 80 staff members having tested positive for the virus between the two locations, according to state data.
