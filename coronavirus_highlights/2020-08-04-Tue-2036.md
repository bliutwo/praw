## 'Too many are selfish': US nears 5 million virus cases

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/24e2247bb296d6381dc14c0cc1d27d96):

> In Virginia, cases have surged so much in cities like Norfolk and Virginia Beach that Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam placed limits there last week on alcohol sales and gatherings of more than 50 people. Northam, the nation's only governor who is a doctor, cited rising infections among young people and said the problem is that "Too many people are selfish." "People had a bit of quarantine fatigue, is what I'm calling it. People got a bit tired of staying in. People just got together like they have for years on the Fourth of July and spread it to one another."

> New Orleans councilman: '?I would rather have students dumb and alive than have them educated and dead'. The plan to reopen schools in New Orleans was discussed by council members Monday. "I would rather have them dumb and alive than have them educated and dead," said Banks.

> Now, now let's not be defeatists.
> If they work really hard for a good education now, they can grow up to be a doctor or a scientist. Then they too can be ridiculed and ignored while receiving death threats daily from the people who peaked in high school.

> Edit 1 : Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!

> Edit 2 : On a real note, we have to be patient. There is no cure for the virus at this point except time. We have cocktails of drugs that have reduced the duration and severity. Existing antivirals are being used liberally in hopes that they may work as well as a vaccine. Social distancing, masks and sanitizers are our best prophylactic options until a vaccine can be made. Several are undergoing phase 1 and 2 trials across the world, some are even reaching phase 3. It may take another year to roll them out safely and longer than that to distribute enough to reduce the spread, but they're our best chance.

Summary of [original article](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/as-schools-pressured-to-reopen-seven-minors-in-florida-have-died-from-coronavirus/):

> As schools are pressured to reopen amid the global pandemic, two teenagers, along with five other minors ranging between 9 and 17 years old, have died from coronavirus complications, in Florida. More than 38,000 minors in Florida have been infected with the coronavirus and more than 400 have been hospitalized, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health, but the state is still pushing for schools to reopen. Florida surged past their record number of cases last week for four consecutive days, according to a report from John Hopkins, after hitting a single day coronavirus death record earlier in July.

> The only ethical option is shutdown. Problem is our system isnt designed to serve anything close to ethical. We have knowledge of what problems arise from lockdown now so it would be easier to plan and counter those things than it would be to shield only those at risk because *many* disorders can lie beneath the surface in childhood and we don't know how many kids there are with undiagnosed conditions because they are *undiagnosed*.

> NOTHING in the data we've seen in 6 months tells us that we should take risks with this.
