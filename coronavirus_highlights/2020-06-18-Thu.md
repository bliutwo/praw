The policy must require at a minimum that all businesses, visitor or employees wear face mask when in an era or performing an activity which will necessarily involve close contact, according to the new order, Mayor Ron wrote on Twitter. As many as nine Texas Mayors, including Houston Mayor, dispatched an official letter to Abbott for legislative power to issue orders to mandate masks in their cities.

## A Mask is a Stupid Hill to Die on, America

Summary of [original article](https://johnpavlovitz.com/2020/06/17/a-mask-is-a-stupid-hill-to-die-on-america/):

> A mask is the small, selfish, ignorant hill you're choosing to die on? The "Long-term plan," oh maskless ones, is to be a decent human being, to distance, to use restraint, and to wear a mask because 120,000 people have died in four months, because there is no treatment and there is no vaccine-and until there is, people fortunate enough not to be planning funerals right now, shouldn't act like a piece of cloth over their mouths is oppression or hardship. If you refuse to wear a mask in a pandemic, you're not making America great.

> " **One of the oddest phenomenons is people flexing in the face of a pandemic, as if not wearing a mask proves toughness.** **It doesn’t.** **It proves you don’t pay attention, that you don’t respect science, that you reject critical thinking, and that you lack working empathy.** **It’s nothing to boast about.** "  This. Exactly.

## Californians must wear face masks in public under coronavirus order issued by Newsom

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-18/california-mandatory-face-masks-statewide-order-coronavirus-gavin-newsom):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered all Californians to wear face coverings while in public or high-risk settings, including when shopping, taking public transit or seeking medical care, following growing concerns that an increase in coronavirus cases has been caused by residents failing to voluntarily take that precaution. Newsom's order comes a week after Orange County rescinded a requirement for residents to wear masks and as other counties across California are debating whether to join other local jurisdictions in mandating face coverings. State Public Health Officer Dr. Sonia Angell said wearing face coverings, along with hand washing and social distancing, is a proven and effective way to decrease the spread of the coronavirus.
