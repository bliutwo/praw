## FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/owyf0w/faq_recent_cdc_guidance_vaccine_data_and_the/):

> Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.
