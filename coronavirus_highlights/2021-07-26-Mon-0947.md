> Forza! It’s good to see Italy doing so well on vaccinations, after they essentially served as the sacrificial lamb for the western world on how serious this virus was going to become. I think a lot of people had the “oh shit” moment when things really started to spiral out of control in Lombardy.

## Doctors, nurses and other health groups call for mandatory vaccinations for all health workers

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/26/mandatory-vaccinations-urged-health-workers/):

> Medical groups representing millions of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health workers on Monday called for mandatory vaccinations of all U.S. health personnel against the coronavirus, framing the move as a moral imperative as new infections mount sharply. "We call for all health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against covid-19," the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and 55 other groups wrote in a joint statement shared with The Washington Post. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who organized Monday's statement, said he thinks that requiring vaccinations could boost uptake of the shots, beginning with health workers.

> 
> We are now at 97% vaccinated

`/u/nemoknows` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/orxeux/fauci_wants_to_make_vaccines_for_the_next/):

> > The idea is to make “prototype” vaccines to protect against viruses from about 20 families that might spark a new pandemic. Using research tools that proved successful for Covid-19, researchers would uncover the molecular structure of each virus, learn where antibodies must strike it, and how to prod the body into making exactly those antibodies.

## NFL to fine unvaccinated players $14,650 for violating COVID-19 protocols

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/nfl-fine-unvaccinated-players-violating-covid-protocols-5f80ab88-0d6c-461a-8163-9625a6f34a76.html):

> The NFL will fine unvaccinated players $14,650 if they violate COVID-19 protocols this season, ESPN reports. The big picture: The rule change comes two days after the NFL announced that postponed games due to coronavirus outbreaks among unvaccinated players or staffers will not be rescheduled and teams responsible for delays will automatically forfeit. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero obtained the league's COVID-19 protocols for the upcoming season in June, which includes different rules for players who are vaccinated versus those who are not.

## NYC Will Require Vaccination Or Weekly Testing For All City Workers

Summary of [original article](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-will-require-vaccination-or-weekly-testing-all-city-workers):

> Under the latest plan, all city workers must comply with the vaccination-or-test rule beginning on September 13th, which is also the first day of public school in New York City. To assist with enforcement, the city plans to launch a new app that will enable users to validate proof of vaccination or weekly testing. Manhattan Council Member Mark Levine, the chair of the city council's health committee, expressed approval of the mayor's new plan, but he also urged the city to redouble other efforts to increase vaccination rates by educating New Yorkers as well as returning to the indoor mask rule.

`/u/NotYourCity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oryo34/nyc_will_require_vaccination_or_weekly_testing/):

> NYC worker here, been fully vaxxed since April. 
> 
> I can't wait to see all the fucking teachers, cops and hospital workers I know that yammer on about "personal freedoms" quit their jobs now! Oh wait, they probably won't, because they know their argument against vaccination is complete and utter bullshit. I'm glad we jumped on this train and hope the trend continues.
