> Tbh Iâ€™m so burned out that Iâ€™ve started filtering it out and focusing on what I can do: wear a mask, wash my hands, socially distance, and wait for my turn to get the vaccine.

> Otherwise, itâ€™s just extra stress for something I canâ€™t control more than I already am.

County's 10 million residents have been infected with the coronavirus, including nearly 13,000 who have died. In Ventura County on Tuesday, there was a total of 1,002 hospitalized patients - 448 of them infected with the coronavirus.

> I live in LA and this is bone chilling to hear.  More and more friends are getting sick but even still I hadnâ€™t a sense of it being THIS bad.
> 
> This just really feels like weâ€™ve failed now.  Certainly the USA lost the battle early on but now it really feels like the part where the raiders are coming in to sack the village.  Weâ€™re fucked.

## Instacart Becomes Second Company To Pay Workers To Get COVID Vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://labor411.org/411-blog/instacart-becomes-second-company-to-pay-workers-to-get-covid-vaccine/):

> The grocery delivery service, Instacart, has become the second major company to do so. 'With COVID-19 cases continuing to rise across the country, we're taking proactive steps to advocate that government agencies recognize Instacart shoppers as critical essential workers who deserve early access to vaccines,' said Instacart CEO and founder Apoorva Mehta in a statement. "Our goal with the introduction of our new Vaccine Support Stipend is to ensure that, when the time comes, Instacart shoppers don't have to choose between earning income as an essential service provider or getting vaccinated," he continued.
