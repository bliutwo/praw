## Fauci: “I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately”

Summary of [original article](https://www.ft.com/content/57834c2c-a078-4736-9173-8fb32cfbbf4e):

> The president flouts his advice - refusing to wear a mask and holding rallies - and, Fauci tells me, hasn't even met him for more than a month. Fauci may have developed a fan base that is snapping up Fauci T-shirts, mugs and bobblehead dolls - but he has also been disparaged and even received death threats from people who believe coronavirus is a con. Fauci has a fine line to tread. In an interview with Science magazine in March, he said that when Trump makes a mistake, he prefers to get Trump's advisers to correct him for next time.

If you're looking across the world, what are your feelings about how we're doing right now? As a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don't think you can say we're doing great.
