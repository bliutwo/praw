## Texas Closes all Bars. Reduces Restaurant Capacity.

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/26/texas-bars-restaurants-coronavirus-greg-abbott/):

> Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday took his most drastic action yet to respond to the post-reopening coronavirus surge in Texas, shutting bars back down and scaling back restaurant capacity to 50%. He also shut down river-rafting trips and banned outdoor gatherings of over 100 people unless local officials approve. "At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars," Abbott said in a news release. Abbott put Texas under what was effectively a stay-at-home order for most of April, shutting down all but businesses considered essential by the state.

> As the number of people hospitalized in Texas from the coronavirus surpassed 5,000 on Friday, Governor Greg Abbott said he should not have rushed ahead with reopening bars. "If I could go back and redo anything, I would slow down the re-opening of bars," Abbott told ABC affiliate KIVA in El Paso. As the number of new cases of the coronavirus in Texas reached record highs this week, Abbott rolled back some of the state's reopening.

## The US needs to consider "flooding the system with testing," Fauci says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-26-20-intl/h_e396d0898d932025af810f83c0dc5738):

> Contrasting some of the optimistic messaging coming out of the Trump administration in recent days, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said it may be time to "Drop back a few yards" to think about the original reopening guidelines. "I don't think there's time enough now all day to try and analyze and figure out the multifaceted elements that went into that," Fauci said. "When the vice president went back, pulling back a couple of months ago, when we showed about the guidelines to safely reopen the country, we've got to make sure we drop back a few yards and think about that, that this is part of a process that we can be either part of the solution or part of the problem."

> > "No way is it good news when you think there are 10 times more people infected than you thought there were," Fauci said. "So I think that's something that we need to address … to consider start literally flooding the system with testing, to really get a good handle about what is going on in the community."

> Bingo. We can’t fight this if we’re flying blind. Mass testing would require the federal governments help, but if done, would give us a highly accurate picture of the virus.
