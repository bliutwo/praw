## Analysis Finds True Pandemic Death Toll Is Much Higher Than 200,000 in US

Summary of [original article](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/analysis-finds-true-pandemic-death-toll-is-much-higher-than-200000-in-us/):

> BU researchers, who teamed up with collaborators from the University of Pennsylvania and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, found more of these additional deaths in US counties that have greater income inequality, high percentages of non-Hispanic Black residents, less home ownership, and high population density. "Excess deaths include COVID deaths that were ascribed to other causes, as well as the indirect consequences of the pandemic on society," he says. "Our results focus important attention on the disparate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income and minority communities which have historically experienced high death rates," says study coauthor Irma T. Elo, a UPenn professor and chair of sociology.

> I work with people who still believe the death toll is false and probably only 6-10% are truly from covid. So frustrating

## COVID Misinformation Is Killing People

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-misinformation-is-killing-people/):

> With winter around the corner and people spending more time indoors, it is more imperative than ever that we counter misinformation and clearly communicate risks to the public; in addition, as we await the arrival of a vaccine, it is equally important to arm the public with facts. Below are some key recommendations for the science community, public health professionals, members of the public, and industry on what they can do to effectively blunt the effect of misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 response. That's why public health officials must work with social media companies through robust partnerships in order to identify common sources of misinformation; proactively anticipate future misinformation from those sources; and enable its removal in a near real-time fashion.

`/u/I405` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/j9bocz/covid_misinformation_is_killing_people/):

> Some people *want* to believe misinformation.   That's particularly true when the disinformation is politically motivated.
> 
> Providing better information won't fix it, as those who don't want to believe it will ignore it or resist it.   
> 
> If you don't believe me, then look at some of the comments and posts in this subreddit.
> 
> You can lead a horse to water, but the horse may decide to kick you and spit on you.

## Inhaled Vaccines Aim to Fight Coronavirus at Its Point of Attack: Vaccines sprayed into the nose or inhaled through the mouth won’t require needles and could be easier to roll out. They may be more effective too.

## ‘I Feel Like I Have Dementia’: Brain Fog Plagues Covid Survivors

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/health/covid-survivors.html?partner=IFTTT):

> It's becoming known as Covid brain fog: troubling cognitive symptoms that can include memory loss, confusion, difficulty focusing, dizziness and grasping for everyday words. Some people with brain fog still experience lung or heart issues, which can exacerbate neurological symptoms. Experts advise people with brain fog to see doctors to rule out other medical conditions and treat remaining physical symptoms.

`/u/AnnieAnnieSheltoe` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/j98ugy/i_feel_like_i_have_dementia_brain_fog_plagues/):

> I have a chronic illness that causes brain fog (among many other symptoms). It suuuuuuucks. I used to be pretty smart. Honors/AP classes, near perfect SATs, college scholarship. Then I got sick and have gotten progressively worse over the years.
> 
> The brain fog makes my attention span super short. About 90% of the time that I walk into the next room to get something, I can’t remember why I’m there, even though only ten seconds have passed since I decided to get up. I can’t keep track of time. I’ll completely forget what I’m talking about in the middle of a sentence. 
> 
> Learning is *very* slow and difficult. Every sentence has to be read at least three times for me to absorb it. In the past year or so, I’ve started making grammatical mistakes I haven’t made since childhood. I used to be a big stickler about there/they’re/their, to/too/two, etc. Now I’m using the wrong one more and more often.
> 
> Being “smart” was a big part of who I was, not only to myself, but to other people. Now I feel dumb in front of them. It’s frustrating for my husband because I forget things he asks me to do, I can’t follow shows/movies he wants to watch together, and we can’t have conversations about complex topics as easily as we used to.
> 
> Brain fog can be really tough. I hope it’s just temporary for these folks.
> 
> Edit: Sorry this was so long. I’m not very concise these days, and I think I just needed to vent.
