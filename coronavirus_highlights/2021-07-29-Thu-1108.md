## Vaccines work, and are safe.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2vtx/vaccines_work_and_are_safe/):

> Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about clotting or growing a third arm. Clotting is rare from the vaccines and common in Covid; clotting as a vaccine side effect is not nearly as common as it seems from media reports, and is mostly in younger people. The vaccines are FREE in the US. FREE FREE, not like "Copay free", like frickin FREE. You don't need insurance.

> Masks will again be required at indoor county facilities in Florida's populous Miami-Dade following new federal guidance recommending that even people vaccinated against COVID-19 should wear facial coverings. On Tuesday, the CDC changed course on some masking guidelines and recommended that even vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in areas of high transmission. School board members in Broward County held a special meeting Wednesday to discuss mask-wearing, a day after roughly two dozen mask opponents disrupted the meeting in screaming matches and burned masks outside the building.
