## Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Retains Neutralizing Activity Against Emerging Variants First Identified in the U.K. and the Republic of South Africa

Summary of [original article](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against):

> The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID's Vaccine Research Center. This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements regarding: the Company's development of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus; the potential for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease and slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by producing neutralizing titers against new, emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1. 351 variants; plans to test additional booster doses of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2; the Company's development of a new, strain-specific booster candidate against SARS-CoV-2; the speed and flexibility with which the Company's mRNA technology can develop vaccines against new strains of the coronavirus; and the necessity of additional booster doses to address waning immunity to, and new variants of, the coronavirus.

> I had the Moderna vaccine and am really encouraged by the fact that they’re already working on a new vaccine for the SA strain that they could use as a booster/alternative. My guess is they won’t roll it out in the US until that strain becomes more dominant because it looks like the British strain is our biggest short-term concern here, which the vaccine is very effective in preventing.

## CVS completes first round of COVID-19 vaccination at 8,000 U.S. nursing homes

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersComService_2_MOLT/idUSKBN29U1CL):

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp has completed the first round of COVID-19 vaccinations at about 8,000 U.S. skilled nursing facilities that were part of a federal program, the drugstore chain said on Monday. The Trump administration tapped CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance last year to run nursing home vaccinations and the first vaccinations began in late December. Nursing homes residents were in the first priority group for a vaccine in the United States because they are most likely to die of COVID-19.However, state officials have raised alarms that inoculations at nursing homes were moving more slowly than expected, a Reuters analysis found earlier this month, even as federal officials pushed states to make vaccines available for other groups, like people over 65.

## Moderna says it's working on Covid booster shot for variant in South Africa, says current vaccine provides some protection

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/covid-vaccine-moderna-working-on-covid-booster-shots-for-south-african-strain.html):

> Its researchers said its current coronavirus vaccine appears to work against the two highly transmissible strains found in the U.K. and South Africa, although it looks like it may be less effective against the latter. The vaccine generated a weaker immune response against the South African strain, but the antibodies remained above levels that are expected to be protective against the virus, the company said, adding the findings may suggest "a potential risk of earlier waning of immunity to the new B.1.351 strains." "Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic to determine if it will be more effective to boost titers against this and potentially future variants," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.

## ‘My worst nightmare’: Mother speaks after 11-year-old son suffers heart problems due to COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2021/01/25/my-worst-nightmare-mother-speaks-after-year-old-son-suffers-heart-problems-due-covid-/):

> CRESTON, Iowa - An Iowa mother is warning others to take COVID-19 seriously after her 11-year-old son ended up in the hospital with a rare but potentially life-threatening complication from the virus. Jaxson ended up in the cardiac intensive care unit at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, where doctors diagnosed him with myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. "They told me that he was in the beginning stages of heart failure. He was beginning to retain fluid, having a high fever. His heart rate was very fast. He was almost in a state of shock," Green said.
