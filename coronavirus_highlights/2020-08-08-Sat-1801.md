## “Nationwide, 200,700 more people have died than usual from Mar 15 to Jul 25, according to CDC estimates, which adjust current death records to account for typical reporting lags..54,000 higher than the official count of coronavirus deaths for that period.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html):

> Pennsylvania's death counts, for example, have lagged behind the state's usual rate of reporting all year, according to the C.D.C. But comparing recent totals of deaths from all causes can provide a more complete picture of the pandemic's impact than tracking only deaths of people with confirmed diagnoses. In many states with excess deaths, the total number of them exceeded the official number of measured Covid-19 deaths. Total death numbers are estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on death certificates counted by the centers, adjusted to account for typical lags in the reporting of deaths.

> Excess death is really the only way to measure the scale of the impact a pandemic like this has, as it strips out all the argument of cause of death and simply looks at what was likely to be the human toll. 
> 
> The studies we get in the years following the pandemic about the likely mortality numbers and also potential increases in covid related illnesses such as heart and lung disease in survivors are how we can gauge the true impact. 
> 
> This unfortunately does little to quiet those shouting about low death rate and day to day changes. The best we can do in the interim is keep good records and analyse as swiftly as possible in shorter term studies.

## One-third of children hospitalized with COVID-19 require ICU care, CDC says

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/08/07/One-third-of-children-hospitalized-with-COVID-19-require-ICU-care-CDC-says/4941596822940/):

> Aug. 7 - Roughly one in three children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States has required treatment in the intensive care unit, according to figures released Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although ICU admission rates were about the same for children and adults, invasive mechanical ventilation was required in less than 6% of children, compared to nearly 19% of adults, CDC researchers said. More than 40% of the hospitalized children also had an underlying chronic health condition, with obesity being the most common, the CDC researchers said.
