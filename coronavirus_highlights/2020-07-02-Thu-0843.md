## In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can’t Have Both.

> The sadder flip side - the friend who told me that if their school reopens, her children are going back whether it's safe or not because she cannot afford to not work - edges closer. Despite our own financial strain, we've continued to pay the nanny who used to help shuttle the kids around while we worked, even though she hasn't worked for us since March. Allowing workplaces to reopen while schools, camps and day cares remain closed tells a generation of working parents that it's fine if they lose their jobs, insurance and livelihoods in the process.

> I understand why this is getting some hate, but I'm constantly seeing posts about people choosing to pay rent or eat... some can't do both right now. Adding a new baby to the mix is not an option for many. This is a hard truth for at least half of America atm. Daycares aren't safe and being a parent to a young child, let alone an infant, is beyond a full time job.

## The US isn't in a second wave of coronavirus – the first wave never ended

> The U.S. as a whole is not in a second wave because the first wave never really stopped. With talk of a second wave in the news, as an epidemiologist and public health researcher, I think there are two necessary factors that must be met before we can colloquially declare a second wave. Places experiencing local second waves: Looking only at a state level, Hawaii, Montana and Alaska could be said to be experiencing second waves.

Summary of [original article](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/disabled-man-dies-after-texas-hospital-withheld-coronavirus-treatment-55434):

> CNA Staff, Jun 30, 2020 / 04:10 pm MT.- A woman in Texas says that her husband was denied treatment for COVID-19, was moved to a hospice, and then starved for six days after a doctor decided that his quality of life did not merit care due to his preexisting disabilities. After he was admitted to St. David's South Austin, his wife, Melissa Hickson, said she recorded a conversation she had with a doctor, where he explained that he did not want to administer coronavirus treatment to her husband because of his concerns that treatment would not improve Michael's quality of life. Representatives from Family Eldercare made the decision to remove Michael from the hospital and place him in a hospice.

> > Melissa replied “What do you mean? Because he’s paralyzed with a brain injury he doesn’t have quality of life?” she asked. The doctor replied “correct.” 
> 
> This is what happens under triage rules. And triage rules come about when your state, local and federal govt totally botch their coronavirus plan and decide that money is more important than peoples lives.
