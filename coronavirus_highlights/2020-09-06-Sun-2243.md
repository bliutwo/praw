## Signs of depression have tripled in the U.S. since the COVID-19 pandemic got underway

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-09-03/signs-of-depression-have-tripled-since-start-of-covid-pandemic):

> The prevalence of sleep troubles, lethargy, feelings of hopelessness and other depression symptoms in adults across the country has more than tripled since the pandemic began, according to a new study. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, researchers found that nearly 10% of Manhattanites had symptoms of depression and 7.5% had signs of PTSD, with the highest risk seen in people who lived closest to Ground Zero, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported. A survey of Toronto residents forced to quarantine due to the 2003 SARS outbreak revealed that 31% had symptoms of depression and 29% had signs of PTSD. And in 2015, during the Ebola epidemic, nearly half of the people living in Sierra Leone had at least one sign of anxiety or depression, and more than three-quarters had a symptoms of PTSD. Although America's COVID-19 case count was about 600,000 in mid-April and the death toll was around 23,000, the coronavirus had made itself felt almost everywhere.

> Sounds about right - pretty much everyone I know has dealt with chronic low feelings in the past few months.
> 
> I got hit with a really bad bout of depression in January and it's been slowly getting better, but it's been harder to climb out compared to previous episodes. When I share with someone that I'm dealing with that, I always feel the need to say "no, no, I was depressed BEFORE it was covid" like some kind of sadness hipster lol

## Covid-19 Live Updates: New York Goes a Month With a Positivity Rate of Under 1 Percent

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/06/world/covid-coronavirus.html):

> New York State is now averaging slightly more than 700 cases a day, according to a New York Times database - up a bit from about 600 in late August, but still a fraction of the 9,000 to 10,000 cases a day it was reporting at the peak in April. A recent outbreak at the State University of New York at Oneonta, a public college in Central New York, showed how quickly new clusters can flare up. On Monday, India reported 90,802 new infections, breaking its own record from the day before and taking its total to more than 4.2 million, according to a New York Times database.

> 
> And how severe are restrictions now?  Are restaurants and bars still outdoor only?

## Covid patients have lung damage 'weeks after leaving hospital' | Coronavirus outbreak

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/covid-patients-have-lung-damage-weeks-after-leaving-hospital):

> The results reveal that six weeks after leaving hospital, 88% of patients still showed signs of lung damage in CT scans - such as patches resembling ground glass - while 47% of patients were experiencing breathlessness. Among other findings, lung volume available for breathing was less than 80% of what would be expected for an average person in 24 of the patients at six weeks, and 16 of the patients at 12 weeks. While lung damage at discharge was more severe among those who had been in intensive care, the team say these patients showed a similar rate of improvement in lung damage over time as those who had not been in intensive care.

> Frontline health care worker, here. I've gone into countless Covid-19 rooms for the last 3 months. We have PPE, and I've taken all of the precautions, but none of my team of 11 people has contracted the virus. I just got tested for covid 2 days ago; nasal and blood. All negative. Frankly, I'm shocked. I figured that if nothing else, I'd at least be asymptomatic. But nope. Negative. I'm not an epidemiologist, but I think it speaks to the power of PPE and hand washing. But it's just a guess.

## N95 masks being rationed at Minnesota hospitals, six months into pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.startribune.com/n95-masks-being-rationed-at-minnesota-hospitals-six-months-into-pandemic/572337252/):

> The ANA, which is not a labor union, now agrees with the National Nurses United union that the federal government should leverage the Defense Production Act to increase domestic manufacturing of N95 masks for front-line caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. State records show that collectively, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities in the state have 1.3 million medical-grade N95 masks in storage, and the state stockpile in St. Paul holds 259,000 more. Despite having more than a million N95s in the state for health care workers, nurses in the ANA survey reported that the N95 respirator is still among the most difficult personal protective items to obtain at work, behind surgical masks, gowns, face shields and goggles.
