> 
> Fwiw, my work is asking everyone who's been vaccinated to send HR a copy of vaccination record. They've also asked if you don't send in the card or if you haven't been vaccinated to wear a mask. Haha. Curious to see how this will be enforced.

> There’s a stronger argument for mask mandates because of how important in-person learning is. If you’re not comfortable with maskless restaurants or concerts, you can choose to avoid those situations easily. But given what we know about remote learning falling short, parents will have a hard time choosing not to send their kids to school, so I’m sympathetic to a policy which makes that choice easier.

> A nurse prepares a dose of the Soberana 02 vaccine during its clinical trials at a hospital amid concerns about the spread of the coronavirus disease in Havana, Cuba, June 29, 2021. HAVANA, July 8 - Cuba said on Thursday its two-shot Soberana 2 vaccine, delivered with a booster called Soberana Plus, had proven 91.2% effective in late stage clinical trials against the coronavirus, following similar news about its Abdala vaccine. While the Cuban efficacy claims have not been peer reviewed, the results, if accurate, would catapult the U.S.-boycotted Caribbean island nation into the select group of the United States, Germany and Russia that produce vaccines with efficacy of more than 90% - Novavax, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sputnik V.Cuba's biotech sector has a long history of vaccine development, producing 80% of vaccines used in the country and exporting some of them.

> For comparison, the efficacy of 2/3 doses of Soberana 2 is 62%. 3 doses of Cuba's other vaccine (Abdala) also has >90% efficacy.
> 
> There is now evidence that a third dose can offer greater protection. I wonder if this could apply to other vaccines with lower efficacy such as Sinovac?

## High vaccination rates drive low numbers of new COVID deaths in Louisiana nursing homes

Summary of [original article](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_0497c8f4-e0f6-11eb-80f4-c3c4bc4397a1.html):

> Because many nursing homes have high vaccination rates, the statistics offer a glimpse of what herd immunity could look like. State health leaders have raised warnings about the low vaccination rates and a recent surge in cases across Louisiana. The arrival of new variants, plus the potential need for booster shots of vaccine, mean vigilance within nursing homes should remain high, said Brian Lee, of Families for Better Care, an advocacy group focused on long-term care facilities.

## Delta accounts for nearly all virus cases in southwestern Missouri, where a hospital recently ran out of ventilators.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/09/world/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-updates/delta-accounts-for-nearly-all-virus-cases-in-southwestern-missouri-where-a-hospital-recently-ran-out-of-ventilators):

> Less than a third of the populations of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea have gotten even one dose of a coronavirus shot, according to a New York Times tracker. "A lot of this is based on what's going on with progress on the vaccines," Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. "Obviously we see good news and bad news out there in terms of the variants. One moment, you're reading about a variant happening across the world, the next you know, it's becoming the dominant strain here in the U.S.". Missouri has been averaging about 1,000 new cases per day, a 44 percent increase over the past two weeks, though a fraction of the state's November peak when its average topped 5,000, according to a New York Times database.
