## Vaccines work, and are safe.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2vtx/vaccines_work_and_are_safe/):

> Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about clotting or growing a third arm. Clotting is rare from the vaccines and common in Covid; clotting as a vaccine side effect is not nearly as common as it seems from media reports, and is mostly in younger people. The vaccines are FREE in the US. FREE FREE, not like "Copay free", like frickin FREE. You don't need insurance.

> This is a big announcement, as it'll affect tens of millions of people. I think now that everyone nationally has had ample time to get double vaxxed, Ottawa is done with the science deniers. We're rapidly approaching a point where if you want to do anything more than go to the grocery store, you'll need proof of vaccination. I for one wholly welcome this. The timing of the announcement is also not particularly subtle, the Liberals are banking on the large majority of the population who did receive both doses to vote for this ruling and for their party in the soon-to-be-announced snap election.
