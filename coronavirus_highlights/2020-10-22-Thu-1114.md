> I’ve been thinking so much about the high schoolers/college students affected by Covid since this whole thing began that I forgot about the kids who are starting their very first year of schooling completely virtual. How jarring that must be.

> Wisconsinite here. We have a mask mandate, and a 25% occupancy mandate in bars and restaurants. I went for a walk in my city, Oconomowoc, last night at 5:30. Bars and restaurants within a half-mile of my house were full, no masks. I even saw an unmasked cop standing in a bar talking to an unmasked bartender. You want to know why we can’t overcome this? You want to know why our hospitals are full? That is why. Please put on a mask or stay home. Think about someone besides yourself. Drink at home for half the price.
