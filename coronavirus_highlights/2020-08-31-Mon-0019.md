## Japan has the worldâ€™s oldest population. Yet it dodged a coronavirus crisis at elder-care facilities.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-coronavirus-elderly-death-rate/2020/08/29/f30f3ca8-e2da-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html?ref=hvper.com):

> The contrast is partly because Japan reacted more quickly than Western nations to developments in nearby China, swiftly tightening controls on staff and visitors at its eldercare homes, said Reiko Hayashi, deputy director general of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Culture also appeared to play an important role: Experts point to a higher priority given to elderly care within society, stronger measures already in place at care homes to prevent infections and high standards of hygiene. There is still a level of expectation within society that elderly people should not be neglected, and that care homes should be carefully regulated.

> As mentioned in the article, two things I do agree that Japan has done well is elder care (especially due to its aging population fr decades) and the infrastructure such as Internet, electricity, water, etc. to uphold it.

`/u/whozwat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ijpsqo/covid19_deaths_show_no_sign_of_decline_data_deep/):

> Death rate is not that significant because we don't know how many people have contracted the virus which is exactly the doubt Trump wants to seed.   However, actual number of deaths per day is not dropping.
