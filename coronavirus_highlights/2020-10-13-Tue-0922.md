> This is a good illustration that your time is usually better spent adding another layer than trying to fix the gaps.
> 
> If you're already wearing a mask, don't try and research the best kinds of mask to upgrade,instead maybe you start washing your hands more.
> 
> If you're already washing your hands plenty, then don't worry about the best type of soap, or increasing the frequency further. Instead maybe it's time to install your country's track and trace app.
> 
> A lot of medium quality interventions is better than one good one.

> “The report said the initial patient, a 13-year-old girl, was exposed to COVID-19 during a large outbreak in June. A rapid antigen test four days after her exposure came back negative, before her symptoms began. Two days later she had some nasal congestion, her only symptom. That day she traveled with her parents and two brothers to attend a large family gathering, which began the following day, according to the CDC report.
> 
> She was one of 14 relatives ranging in age from 9 to 72 who shared a five-bedroom, two-bathroom home for eight to 25 days, the report said. The relatives did not wear face masks or practice physical distancing, according to the report.
> 
> Eleven other family members contracted the virus; one was hospitalized and another went to the emergency room for treatment of respiratory symptoms, but both recovered, according to the report.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/sorry-sunshine-wrong-place-winston-peters-shuts-down-american-covid-19-denier-campaign-event):

> Winston Peters had no time for a question from a Covid-19 denier at a New Zealand First campaign event in Tauranga today. Peters - who had already been short with the man for attempting to ask three questions rather than one - didn't hold back in his answer. The man then tried to reply but Peters moved on to the next question, telling him: "Quiet, we have manners at our meetings as well."

## It’s not going away: We need a real, non-political debate about the best way to live with COVID or countries will fracture

Summary of [original article](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2020/10/12/its-not-going-away-we-need-a-real-non-political-debate-about-the-best-way-to-live-with-covid-or-countries-will-fracture/?mc_cid=5011eb7ba5&mc_eid=03a38703ca):

> A few days later, over 60 doctors wrote another letter saying: "We are concerned due to mounting data and real world experience, that the one-track response threatens more lives and livelihoods than Covid-lives saved." Science is not a dogma, and views often need to be modified in the light of increasing knowledge and experience. For children, for whom the risk of death from COVID is almost zero and the risks of long-term effects are thought to be very low, it is easier to weigh up the negative effects of not going to school or of being trapped in households with rising domestic abuse.

`/u/afops` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jad98x/its_not_going_away_we_need_a_real_nonpolitical/):

> How would something relating to laws, the economy, human behavior, education, healthcare ever be a "non-political debate"? I think the mistake is rather that people tend to think you can use non-scientific arguments in politics.
