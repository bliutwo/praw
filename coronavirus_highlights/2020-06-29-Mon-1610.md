> New Jersey will not reopen indoor dining this week as planned in the first major reversal of the state's Phase 2 coronavirus reopening plan, Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday. Murphy cited recent scenes from expanded outdoor bar and restaurants showing packed crowds not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing as a reason from pausing indoor dining indefinitely. Murphy had provided the detailed restrictions for indoor dining at restaurants on Saturday, but changed his mind just two days later.

> I appreciate that the tone of his comments were basically "this is why we can't have nice things."
> 
> I actually wish Illinois would do this as well. Open up outdoor spaces, but leave the indoor for when we truly have things in hand and have compliance with mask wearing.

Summary of [original article](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/06/29/planet-fitness-coronavirus/):

## Two Friends in Texas Were Tested for Coronavirus. One Bill Was $199. The Other? $6,408.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/upshot/coronavirus-tests-unpredictable-prices.html):

> Their tests came back with the same result - negative, allowing the trip to go ahead - but the accompanying bills were quite different. During the pandemic, there has been wide variation between what providers bill for the same basic diagnostic test, with some charging $27, others $2,315. The Trump administration has taken steps to limit patients' out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus testing and treatment, using relief funds to reimburse providers for uninsured patients' bills.

> This is eye-popping.  Two people going to the exact same emergency room for a test. One pays cash for $199, the other ops to use her health insurance and receives a bill over $6,000 for her share, negotiated down $1,000.  Nationalized health-care cometh baby.

## Europeans' trust in US as world leader collapses during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/29/europeans-trust-in-us-as-world-leader-collapses-during-pandemic):

> The report states: "Europeans' trust in the US is gone. Many have been appalled by the [US's] chaotic response to Covid-19; the lack of solidarity it showed with Europeans in the 12 March closure of its border to members of the Schengen area; and its lack of leadership in tackling the coronavirus crisis at the global level - or even engagement with the issue." The ECFR's analysis suggests the shift in European attitudes transcends hostility to Donald Trump or his administration's poor handling of the virus outbreak in the US. Its authors believe there is now a more profound uncertainty about America as a force for good, America's commitment to multilateralism and the US's ability to lead the world. Without the US at the head of the multilateral system, the authors conclude, Europeans want the EU to take more "Ownership" of international challenges such as the pandemic and the climate emergency.

## Jacksonville changes course, issues face mask mandate

Summary of [original article](https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/29/jacksonville-issues-face-mask-mandate/):

> The order, which goes into effect at 5 p.m. Monday, comes after Mayor Lenny Curry said last week he had no plans to issue a face mask mandate. "Healthcare experts advise masks and cloth face coverings help slow the spread from individuals with COVID-19 to vulnerable populations including from those who are asymptomatic," said Nikki Kimbleton, Director of Public Affairs for the City of Jacksonville. Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending that everyone wears a face mask in public in April, there is no federal mandate requiring people to do so.

> Being a hospital employee, I feel really conflicted.

> We absolutely need to reduce the spread and masks are a proven way to achieve that. And mandates do increase compliance.
> 
> However, we really need to shut down.

> So my jubilee is really undercut by how underwhelming this is.
