> In my experience, in LA, a lot of people were still masking up indoors anyway. I went to the super market yesterday and maybe 5 out of 40 people in the store didn't have a mask
> 
> Edit: I should say this is not a judgement on those that do. Well more than half of LA county is vaccinated and can responsibly not wear a mask indoors. My main point is that LA residents have been more cautious than they need to be about unmasking and thats also not bad, and in fact may have helped buy that much more time.

## Ireland to limit indoor bar, restaurant service to vaccinated people

Summary of [original article](https://reut.rs/3A7S8Tn):

> DUBLIN, June 29 - Ireland said on Tuesday it will restrict indoor drinking and eating in bars and restaurants to those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or who have previously been infected by it due to concerns about the Delta variant. Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who announced a general slowdown of the easing of public health restrictions, said that health officials told him they thought that the variant made indoor hospitality too dangerous for the unvaccinated. "The safest way to now proceed with a return to indoor hospitality is to limit access to those who have been fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID infection," Martin said.

> Wish we could do this in the US. But everyone here is so damn entitled. Not that Iâ€™m perfect, but damn some of the people here really suck.

## COVID-19 Delta strain spreading 'rapidly' in Mississippi

Summary of [original article](https://mississippitoday.org/2021/06/28/covid-19-delta-strain-spreading-rapidly-in-mississippi/?utm_source=pushly):

> As Mississippi's vaccination effort continues to limp forward, state health officials are warning of the massive threat the Delta variant of COVID-19 poses to the unvaccinated, and of a potential surge of infections set off by a strain that's much more infectious and potentially deadlier than the original strain of the virus. The vaccines are nearly as effective against the Delta variant as the original strain, greatly minimizing the chance of infection and nearly eliminating the risks of developing a serious illness. Despite the wide availability of vaccines and the risks posed by variants, Mississippi continues to rank last in the nation in the share of its population that has been vaccinated.
