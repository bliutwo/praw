## Disney theme park staff worry about Covid-19: 'I can't bring it back home

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/disney-world-coronavirus-staff-worry-covid-19-reopening):

> "People are afraid of going back to work because of the imminent threat of contracting Covid, since we, Florida, are now the epicenter of the world for this pandemic, and they are also afraid of not going back to work because we have no financial support," said Rey. "My main concern going back to work is: I have young children and my mom is elderly. I can't bring coronavirus home. It's not really safe to go back to work. The cases are rising in California," said Inez Guzman, who has worked in housekeeping at the Disneyland Hotel for five years. A representative for Disney told the Guardian the opening of Disneyland was pending guidance from state officials, while worker training, a range of health and safety measures, cleaning, disinfecting and technological solutions have been implemented ahead of Disney World's reopening.

## Coronavirus kills another 1,000 in Texas in just 10 days

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/20/coronavirus-deaths-texas/):

> After the first COVID-19 death in Texas - a 97-year-old man in Matagorda County who died March 15 - it took 53 days before the state reached 1,000 deaths. On Monday, Texas reached 4,020 deaths only 10 days after crossing the 3,000 threshold. New coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have been rising fast across Texas since the beginning of June, and the number of deaths is now rising more quickly as well - a "Very predictable" outcome, said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston.

## Masks don't merely help to protect the wearer, they limit the amount of virus exposure, which in turn limits the severity of symptoms should the wearer get sick. In locations with near 100% masks wearing, if an outbreak occurred, 95% of those infected were asymptomatic.

> We generally have a very strict policy of removing any submissions where the post submission title does not match the article title and requesting that the post be resubmitted with the correct title. This is also one of the subreddit rules. This post title does not match the article title. By the time a mod caught this, it was already highly upvoted and on the front page. Given that the title isn't exactly sensationalized, it'll be allowed to stay up.  
> &nbsp;  
> 
> This post is flaired as "Misleading Title" because the title makes a very strong claim that locations where an outbreak occurred with 100% mask wearing had 95% of the infected as asymptomatic. However, the article itself only loosely discusses this and the one specific location discussed where an outbreak occured was a single factory.

## Fauci says he wasn't aware White House coronavirus briefings were returning

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dr-fauci-says-he-wasn-t-aware-white-house-coronavirus-n1234459):

> President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he will resume regular coronavirus briefings at the White House was apparently news to America's top infectious disease expert. Trump curtailed his regular coronavirus briefings in April. Fauci spoke to Shriver one day after Trump characterized him as "a little bit of an alarmist" during an interview with "Fox News Sunday."

> Oh good, so it’ll be only the “experts” talking. Hard pass.

## Facebook suspends anti-mask group for spreading COVID-19 misinformation

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331060/anti-mask-groups-facebook-misinformation):

> Facebook has removed one of the largest anti-mask groups on its platform for violating its policies against spreading misinformation about COVID-19. "We have clear policies against promoting harmful misinformation about COVID 19 and have removed this group while we review the others," Facebook spokesperson Dami Oyefeso said in an email. A scathing report in April from human rights group Avaaz found 100 pieces of misinformation regarding the virus on Facebook were shared more than 1.7 million times and viewed about 117 million times.

`/u/alberg_30` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hv0fp2/facebook_suspends_antimask_group_for_spreading/):

> Earlier, when the WHO was advising against general mask usage, Facebook censored my pro-mask messages, and attempts to distribute masks (as donations, for free). They literally stopped me from giving out masks to my community at the start of a respiratory pandemic.
> 
> I have since delete my account. I didn't sign on to have "friends-only" communications policed by a corporation.
