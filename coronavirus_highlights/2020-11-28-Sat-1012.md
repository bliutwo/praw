## U.S. hospitalizations top 90,000 for the first time

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-hospitalizations-top-90000-united-states/):

> On Thanksgiving Day, hospitalizations hit a record high of more than 90,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project, and about 50 Americans are now dying every hour.
The true case count could be much higher, considering an expected dip in positivity rates linked to a surge in pre-holiday testing.
"A lot of people flooded into testing programs to get tested before they traveled for Thanksgiving," said Dr.
Emily Landon of the University of Chicago Medical Center, adding, "But they do bring the positivity rates down by flooding the testing market with a number of low risk individuals."

## Pope Blasts Those Who Criticize COVID Restrictions in the Name of “Personal Freedom”

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/pope-francis-blasts-critics-covid-restrictions-personal-freedom.html?via=recirc_recent):

> Pope Francis praised health care workers and criticized those who are protesting restrictions imposed by governments to stop the spread of COVID-19 in a New York Times op-ed.
Some governments have "Shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences." And other governments that have acted decisively have received pushback.
"To come out of this crisis better, we have to recover the knowledge that as a people we have a shared destination," Francis wrote.

`/u/Molire` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k2ecfo/pope_blasts_those_who_criticize_covid/):

> >Even though the coronavirus “may seems special because it affects most of humankind” there are “a thousand other crises that are just as dire” but we can pretend they don’t exist because they don’t affect us so directly. Among these “unseen viruses” are climate change, the refugee crisis, hunger and wars. “To come out of this crisis better, we have to recover the knowledge that as a people we have a shared destination,” Francis wrote. “The pandemic has reminded us that no one is saved alone.”

## They had coronavirus. Now they’re showing up at memory clinics with serious cognitive loss

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/11/they-had-coronavirus-now-theyre-showing-up-at-memory-clinics-with-serious-cognitive-loss.html):

> The journal Neurology Today is reporting hundreds of COVID-19 "Long-haulers" being treated for cognitive problems at specialty clinics set up in areas hardest hit by the virus.
Rondeau, who founded the Montclair Memory Clinic in 2001, had seen instances in the past where a virus similar to COVID-19 led to perplexing cognitive loss in a person who had no previous memory issues.
That's what leaves Rondeau and other experts concerned about the cognitive issues now being seen in people who have survived coronavirus.

`/u/lollylan` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k2qezn/they_had_coronavirus_now_theyre_showing_up_at/):

> A fellow doctor that I treated as a patient of mine lost most of his memory and will probably never work as a doctor ever again. He is in neurological therapy but there is only so much you can do against hundreds of ministrokes.
