> > But though the agency says some of those travelers subsequently fell ill, in the face of incomplete contact tracing information and a virus that incubates over several days, it has not been able to confirm a case of transmission on a plane.
> 
> This is absolute bs and hiding from the CDC. They should just stop and let someone competent do their work instead. Probably any 6 year old would do better.
> 
> I mean, come on. Look at the Sturgis rally. One man tracked down almost half a million cell phone records and people and assembled a very clear picture of the infection rate within a few weeks. And you're telling me the CDC with all the funding and money they have for this problem can't figure out 11,000 people?

## ‘They sacrificed the elderly’: How Covid-19 spread in Sweden’s care homes

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/20200916-they-sacrificed-the-elderly-how-covid-19-spread-in-sweden-s-care-homes):

> Care home residents account for nearly half of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Sweden, a high proportion that health professionals and families of the victims have blamed on the government's reluctance to admit elderly patients to hospital. Sweden has seen more than 5,800 deaths from Covid-19 - nearly half of them in care homes. "They didn't try to save their lives. They were scared that the intensive care units would be overwhelmed and you couldn't take care of young people," says Anders Vahlne, a professor of virology at the Karolinska Institute.

> Basically all care homes in other countries got fucked too. It's not specific to Sweden

## Philadelphia pediatrician Paul Offit: Prepare to wear masks and socially distance even after getting COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dr-offit-prepare-to-wear-masks-and-socially-distance-even-after-getting-covid-19-vaccine-2020-09-17):

> Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, told friends not to worry about the coronavirus. As a vaccine expert - he helped develop the rotavirus vaccine, which protects young children against infections with the virus that can cause severe diarrhea, and sits on the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee - Offit is now keeping a close eye on the clinical trials under way for COVID-19 vaccine candidates and the Trump administration's potential influence on federal agencies closely involved in the pandemic response. Offit: I'm not sure it matters, as long as we hold this vaccine to the same standards we do to every other vaccine for the last 70 years, whether it's called a licensure or an approval or authorization.

`/u/eyebeefa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwewda/philadelphia_pediatrician_paul_offit_prepare_to/):

> The people that get vaccinated are not going to continue to social distance and wear masks. It’s just not going to happen, at least in the USA

## [Spain] Hospitals in Madrid nearing the abyss: 18 of them have an occupancy of over 90% [Article in Spanish, translation in the comments]

Summary of [original article](https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/hospitales-madrid-acercan-abismo-18-ocupacion-superior-90_1_6231636.html):

> Los datos a los que ha accedido este periódico reflejan que 18 hospitales de Madrid ya tienen una ocupación superior al 90% de su capacidad y en muchos las UCI están al 100%. Con este escenario, los quirófanos vuelven a reconvertirse en zonas para atender a los enfermos más graves, se suspenden intervenciones quirúrgicas y se empiezan a montar tiendas de campaña para atender a una oleada de pacientes que se esperan en los próximos días por la creciente curva en los contagios. En la Comunidad de Madrid los hospitales están a un nivel de ocupación de prácticamente del 80%. y 18 de 59 hospitales madrileños están actualmente a un porcentaje de ocupación superior al 90%, mientras que 37 de ellos en una ocupación superior al 80%, según las cifras del 16 de julio. Según los datos por hospitales, en cuidados intensivos la ocupación en los centros públicos de Madrid está ya al 87% de su capacidad, una cifra que dista de la que ofrecen los responsables de la Consejería de Sanidad que defienden que está al 40%. Entre públicos y privados esta ocupación desciende al 79% pero sigue siendo el doble de la que ofrecen desde el departamento de Enrique Ruiz Escudero.

Summary of [original article](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-09-11/Hundreds-of-thousands-have-been-given-Chinese-COVID-19-vaccines-THnoo6BcFG/index.html):

> Hundreds of thousands of people have been given two Chinese COVID-19 vaccine candidates as part of an emergency program, without a single case of infection or adverse effects, a senior official of a state-owned vaccine developer has said. The vaccines could protect an individual against the novel coronavirus for one to three years, based on the results of animal experiments, phase one and phase two trials, and similar vaccines using similar technology, according to Zhou. The vaccines should be able to work against all strains of the novel coronavirus, according to Zhou.

> What’s going to happen if the Chinese vaccine ends up being the best possible vaccine?  Trump not going to approve it for US because it’s from China?
