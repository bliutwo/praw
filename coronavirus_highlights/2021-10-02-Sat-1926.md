## Vaccination rate for NBA players rises to 95 percent, sources say

Summary of [original article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32314590/vaccination-rate-nba-players-rises-95-percent-sources-say):

> The NBA has reached a 95% vaccination threshold of its players, reflecting a steady rise since the opening of training camps this week, league sources told ESPN on Thursday. That uptick - which includes players who've minimally received one vaccination shot, sources said - comes as unvaccinated players prepare for losses of salary for games missed in the Bay Area and New York due to local governmental mandates. The orders only apply to the players who play in those markets; out-of-market players are exempted from them.

`/u/quiteCryptic` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/q03auq/vaccination_rate_for_nba_players_rises_to_95/):

> It's nice to see the vast majority taking it seriously in the nba. There's been a few players in particular heavily impacted by covid.
> 
> Still a handful of good players who have not taken it though. One guy on the mavs will probably get cut because of this since he's not great anyways.
