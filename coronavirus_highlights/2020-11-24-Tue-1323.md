> Nearly 300 nursing home residents in Wisconsin died from COVID-19 in the most recent month reported to the federal government - more than 10 times the previous month. At least 592 nursing home residents have died from COVID-19 in Wisconsin since the start of the pandemic, according to the CMS data. "Just as this spring we saw a ton of nursing home outbreaks and lots of illness, hospitalization and deaths from our nursing home population, we know that as we enter the winter months, nursing homes are very high on my list of facilities," Darren Rausch, director of the Greenfield Health Department, said in a recent call with reporters.

> This has been a public messaging disaster.  We ~~literally~~ watched NYC burn down with the COVID in the Spring, and yet communities across the US were somehow convinced their communities were immune.

> Edit: removed the word *literally* because I was literally under attack by literal linguists.

## ‘Florida is a hot mess’: Nurses union raises alarm as coronavirus spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/11/23/florida-is-a-hot-mess-nurses-union-raises-alarm-as-coronavirus-spreads/):

> Nurses from six of the country's coronavirus hotspots, including Florida, held a news conference Monday, pleading with hospital administrators, government leaders and the general public to take COVID-19 more seriously. National Nurses United, the country's largest union for registered nurses, has been vocal since the pandemic's start. There are now four full-time nurses on that floor; the rest are contract or travel nurses.

> •••
> >Problems are prevalent in Florida hospitals, including those the Tampa Bay region, said Marisa Lee, a longtime labor and delivery nurse at Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee. Her hospital and others continue to force nurses to reuse disposable face masks and work on floors they don’t have the training for, she said.
> 
> >Hospitals aren’t testing every patient for the virus, Lee added, and they aren’t testing nurses unless they have symptoms. Patients who are awaiting test results are housed near other patients who do not have the virus, and nurses who have been exposed aren’t being told by management. Those who test positive but do not have symptoms are made to come to work, Lee said.
> 
> >Meanwhile, coronavirus patients are pouring in. About a quarter of Florida’s regular and intensive care unit beds were available Monday afternoon, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration.
> 
> >”Florida is a hot mess,” Lee said. “Florida is wide open with no restrictions of any kind. We have already had many COVID patients and yes, those numbers are exponentially increasing.”
> 
> >The unsafe working conditions have caused many nurses to quit, the union said. At Osceola Regional, 15 emergency room nurses have left and 20 quit from the medical-surgical floor, which has become the COVID-19 unit, Lee said. There are now four full-time nurses on that floor; the rest are contract or travel nurses.

## ‘All People’ Should Avoid Cruise Ships, CDC Warns

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/cdc-warning-all-people-should-avoid-cruise-ships.html):

> At the end of October, amid another surge of COVID-19 cases, the CDC lifted its ban on cruise ships sailing in U.S. waters. Earlier this month, cruise company SeaDream reported that the coronavirus had spread on the first cruise ship to set sail in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic. The Miami Herald reports that no government or independent agency is gathering publicly available data on cruise ship outbreaks, but their own analysis indicates that 3,908 people have contracted the virus on a cruise, resulting in 111 deaths.

`/u/flyingpig104` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jzwmfn/all_people_should_avoid_cruise_ships_cdc_warns/):

> I’m fascinated by the idea of who would voluntarily go on a cruise right now.  The Petri dishiness of it all.  The likelihood of ending up in quarantine.  And knowing that you’d be on a boat full of weirdos who decided to go on a mid-pandemic cruise.

> Has there been any country that has stopped covid simply by having a high percentage of compliance with mask wearing? 
> 
> Countries like Australia and China both used lockdowns, in addition to other things, to get covid under control. Korea and Singapore did not have lockdowns, but used aggressive contact tracing to get covid under control. 
> 
> So I find it difficult to believe that masks **alone** is sufficient to eliminate covid.
