Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/white-house-moves-up-vaccine-supply-timeline-says-us-will-have-enough-for-every-adult-by-end-of-may.html):

> President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that the U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to vaccinate every adult in the nation by the end of May - two months earlier than previously expected. "We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May," Biden said at the White House. Less than a month earlier, the Biden administration offered a more modest prediction: that the U.S. would have enough vaccine supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July.

## Covid vaccines may stop spread ‘almost completely’

Summary of [original article](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/covid-vaccine-results-public-health-england-b921793.html):

> Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz told Bild that the European Medicines Agency was "Too slow" to approve vaccines and added: "We should no longer be dependent only on the EU for the production of second-generation vaccines." Professor Devi Sridhar, of the University of Edinburgh, said the data on the coronavirus vaccines were "Better than any of us could have imagined" and called for a celebration of the science when things have returned to normal. Real-world data on the effectiveness of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines is "Stunning" and countries across Europe will take note, said Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group which developed the £3 jab.

## Biden to announce ‘historic partnership’: Merck will help make Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine, officials say

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/02/merck-johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-partnership/):

> President Biden will announce Tuesday that pharmaceutical giant Merck will help make Johnson & Johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine - an unusual pact between fierce competitors that could sharply boost the supply of the newly authorized vaccine, according to senior administration officials. The Biden administration's efforts to ramp up production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine suggest that it sees the vaccine playing a bigger role in addressing the challenges ahead, such as the eventual need for children's vaccines and possibly for boosters to counter virus variants, said a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. Johnson & Johnson is conducting a trial of a two-shot vaccine regimen, with the doses given two months apart; results are not expected until at least May.Johnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

`/u/Igstrangefeed` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lw1f0f/biden_to_announce_historic_partnership_merck_will/):

> Awesome. 
> 
> So this is placing a pretty big bet that the J&J vaccine is going to be approved for children, since that seems to be the focus of this increase.
