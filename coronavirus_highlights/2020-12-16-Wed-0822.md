## California orders 5,000 body bags, refrigerated trucks on standby as COVID surges

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/5000-body-bags-ordered-refrigerated-trucks-standby-covid/story?id=74741632):

> California ordered 5,000 more body bags and has dozens of refrigerated trucks on standby as the state experiences its "Most intense" COVID-19 surge to date, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday. Statewide, ICU capacity is at 5.7%. The San Joaquin Valley and Southern California regions have ICU availability under 2%. When a region hits 0% ICU capacity, surge staffing and surge management go into effect, Newsom said. The governor's briefing comes a day after the state administered its first COVID-19 vaccine dose in Los Angeles County, and thousands of doses are being rolled out across the state.
