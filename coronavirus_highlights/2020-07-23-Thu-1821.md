## If you can‚Äôt wear a mask due to ‚Äúmedical‚Äù reasons, airlines are now telling these passengers to find alternate travel arrangements.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/american-southwest-say-medical-exemptions-cant-be-used-to-avoid-masks.html):

> Passengers who refuse to wear masks based on medical exemptions will no longer be able to fly on American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. The U.S. airline industry was slow to adopt mandatory mask requirements for passengers at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in that country. As nearly two-thirds of U.S. states and an ever-growing list of retailers such as Walmart, Starbucks and Costco now require face coverings, airlines are instituting the strictest mask measures to date, which some travelers say is a little too late.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/american-airlines-face-masks-1519963):

> A recent video posted on Twitter on Tuesday shows a plane full of people clapping as a woman is asked to leave an American Airlines flight due to not having the appropriate face covering. All passengers and crew in the cabin appear to have face coverings, apart from the one woman asked to leave the plane. Young children are not required to wear face coverings and the face mask policy on board does not apply when passengers are eating and drinking.

## US Reports More COVID-19 Cases In The Last Two Weeks Than It Did For All Of June

Summary of [original article](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/07/23/us-more-covid-19-cases-two-weeks-all-of-june/):

> In the past two weeks, the US recorded more than 915,000 new cases of coronavirus - that's more than the cases reported across the country for the entire month of June. The surge in new cases across the South and Southwest has now been linked back to Americans' travel around Memorial Day and reopenings, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday. Louisiana, where the governor said earlier this month progress made in June against the virus was wiped out in weeks, is set to join at least 11 other states who have reported a total of more than 100,000 infections.

## Nearly Two Thirds of Texans Say That COVID-19 Is ‚ÄúOut of Control‚Äù

Summary of [original article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/poll-texans-greg-abbott-coronavirus/):

> It's a view held by people in virtually every part of the state-68 percent of Texans in urban areas, and 59 percent of rural Texans. Though the partisan gap is evident-36 percent of Republicans agree that the coronavirus is out of control, compared with 71 percent of independents and a staggering 95 percent of Democrats-there's reason to believe that partisanship plays a smaller role when the question is framed in less dire terms. Based on the attention that anti-shutdown protests received in the spring, it's fair to wonder whether Abbott's slipping approval rating is coming from the right, as well as the left-is he losing ground among those who believe he's acted with too heavy a hand? The polling doesn't really bear that out: 52 percent of Texans thought that he moved "Too quickly" in easing public safety measures, while only 13 percent of respondents said he acted too slowly in rolling back shutdown orders and reopening businesses.

`/u/forreddituseonly` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hwiwy1/nearly_two_thirds_of_texans_say_that_covid19_is/):

> One striking result from the poll reported on here: 80% of Texans approve of the statewide mask mandate.  Even in Texas, anti-mask sentiment is becoming a fringe view.

`/u/Bizzle_worldwide` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hwg1k8/9yearold_girl_dies_from_coronavirus_she_is_the/):

> I really wish more parents would understand that we‚Äôre still dealing with a new and novel virus, and that children are still being infected, and while they seem to exhibit different symptoms and have different fatality rates, they do still have symptoms and complications and can in fact die from this. 
> 
> Obviously not everyone has the luxury or ability to be a let to remain isolated indefinitely, but the number of parents who actively let their kids roam free and play with friends and go to camps etc right now and justify it by saying ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt get sick‚Äù is astounding.
