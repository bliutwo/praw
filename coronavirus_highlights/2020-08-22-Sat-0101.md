Summary of [original article](https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/my-little-boy-suffered-the-consequences-florida-mom-regrets-lax-approach-to-virus/):

> SARASOTA COUNTY - A 4-year-old Florida boy has been in and out of the hospital multiple times over the last 10 days. In a Facebook post that's now been shared more than 1,000 times since Aug. 8, Thomassen wrote, "I kick myself for being lax about wearing masks and physical distancing. I thumbed my nose at the experts and my little boy suffered the consequencesWe were complacent. We went to the gym without masks. We thought that we were safer because we're all young and healthy." "We have to be really careful as to whether or not he spikes a fever again because that is when it can happen. They have him on a really high dose of steroids, he takes an aspirin every morning to thin his blood out a little they worry about blood clots and yeah, just being monitored constantly, monitored like on a weekly basis unless we see something that is a little off," said Thomassen.

> You have been told for months this is serious. You've seen the numbers. You know how it's spread. You know gatherings and using things others have touched is dangerous. 
> 
> You still live a with a devil may care attitude until someone close to you gets hurt. *Then* you think about what every rational, intelligent person has known since the beginning. You can't totally avoid exposure but there are precautions.
> 
> I'm sorry the innocent have to suffer for the stupid. Positive healing vibes to the child.

## Americans Oppose Religious Exemptions From Coronavirus-Related Restrictions

Summary of [original article](https://www.pewforum.org/2020/08/07/americans-oppose-religious-exemptions-from-coronavirus-related-restrictions/?):

> The vast majority of religious attenders say their house of worship is streaming or recording its religious services so people can watch online or on TV. Among those who attend religious services, mainline Protestants and members of the historically Black Protestant tradition are more likely than Catholics and evangelical Protestants to say they think their congregations should be closed. Taken together, these two questions suggest that about half of U.S. adults who typically attend religious services at least once a month have replaced in-person attendance with virtual participation; 49% say they have watched religious services online or on TV in the last month, but have not attended in-person religious services during this time. During a year of great upheaval in the U.S., what are Americans hearing from religious leaders? Three-quarters of U.S. adults who recently attended religious services in person or watched online say that in the past few months they have heard sermons that have expressed the importance of taking steps to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

`/u/Natoochtoniket` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ie2agp/americans_oppose_religious_exemptions_from/):

> This is not surprising.   The US decided about a hundred years ago that churches should have the same safety requirements as other theaters.  (Things like building codes, fire alarms, exits, and sprinkler systems.)  The building code requirements to have sound structure holding up the roof, do not regulate the content of the show on stage.  The fire regulations do not regulate content of the show on stage, except perhaps if you want to use fire or fireworks as part of the show. 
> 
> Anything that can kill large numbers of the people in the audience is a safety issue, not part of the show.

## CDC says U.S. could control coronavirus in 12 weeks if most Americans wear masks, social distance

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/cdc-says-us-could-control-coronavirus-in-12-weeks-if-most-americans-wear-masks-social-distance.html):

> The U.S. reported more than 44,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, marking an 11% drop in the seven-day average of daily new cases compared with last week, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. Redfield said Thursday that coronavirus deaths, which have remained above an average of 1,000 a day since the end of July, will likely begin to drop over the next week as new cases have been on a sustained decline since about the same time. During the conference call, Redfield urged parents to get their kids vaccinated for influenza as public health officials fear the seasonal flu could further complicate the coronavirus pandemic during the fall season.
