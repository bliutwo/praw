## US coronavirus data will now go straight to the White House. What does this mean for the world?

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbngnews.com/2020/07/us-coronavirus-data-will-now-go.html):

> On April 22, CDC director Robert Redfield stood at the White House briefing room lectern and conceded that the coronavirus pandemic had "Overwhelmed" the United States. The exchange was interpreted by some pundits as confirmation that the CDC's venerated expertise had been sidelined as the coronavirus continued to ravage the US. In the latest development, the New York Times reported this week the CDC has even been bypassed in its data collection, with the Trump administration ordering hospitals to send COVID-19 data directly to the White House. Despite the inevitable challenges that come with tackling a pandemic in real time, the CDC remains the best-positioned agency - not just in the US but the entire world - to help us manage this crisis as safely as possible.

## Missouri Loses Access To Its Own Hospital Data Following Federal Reporting Changes

Summary of [original article](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/missouri-loses-access-its-own-hospital-data-following-federal-reporting-changes):

> The Missouri Hospital Association reports that it no longer has access to the data it uses to guide state coronavirus mitigation efforts, and Kansas officials say their hospital data may be delayed. "Missouri Hospital Association and the State of Missouri will be unable to access critical hospitalization data during the transition. While we are working to collect interim data, situational awareness will be limited," the notice on the department's website says. The hospital association will create an alternate reporting system for hospitals, according to Dillon, and plans to continue producing weekly reports, despite the uncertainty about data.

`/u/shillyshally` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/htg7g5/missouri_loses_access_to_its_own_hospital_data/):

> > “The new datasets for reporting are not identical and in several cases are ill-defined,” Dillon said. “That has complicated hospitals’ efforts.”
> 
> ...
> 
> > The Trump administration said the reporting change was needed due to reporting delays and other problems with the CDC.
> > 
> > But the move has been widely criticized for being disruptive, especially as COVID-19 infection numbers reach new highs and hospitals in some areas of the country are reaching capacity.
> > 
> > “By now, we should have a foolproof, streamlined reporting system for COVID,” Maddox said. “And this change – midstream – is not going to do anything to help our ability to fight the disease.”
> 
> As is all too common with this admin, hospitals had no advance warning of the change. This is just so frigging ridiculous. It's not that the Trump admin has done nothing to contain the virus, the Trump admin has acted to positively *spread*  the virus.

> Edit: And why don't our elected officials just have them testify anyway?? Would they be arrested?
