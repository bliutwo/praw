Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/undocumented-farmworkers-are-refusing-covid-tests-for-fear-of-losing-their-jobs/):

> As workers in an industry with few unions, a lack of basic worker protections, and a workforce that is estimated to be at least 48% undocumented immigrants, farmworkers have many reasons to fear losing their jobs. H2A workers, who comprise over a quarter million workers whose temporary visas are tied to their employers, could be deported if they lose their jobs.
