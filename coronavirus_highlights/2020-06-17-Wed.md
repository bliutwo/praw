> My lease expires in September and I usually get my renewal letter just days before I would have to provide a sixty day move out notice. This year I got it in March because they’re trying to get renewals as quickly as possible. I held out a bit and negotiated the rent to no increase for the next year.   Use the market to your advantage!

> Gov. Ron DeSantis said 260 workers at the Orlando International Airport have tested positive for the coronavirus after nearly 500 employees were tested but according to the airport management that's not the case. Orlando airport executives clarified the numbers Wednesday, clarifying not all 260 people are workers nor were they part of the group of 500 workers tested as referenced by the governor. "Governor DeSantis has emphasized the benefit of testing for COVID-19 and contact tracing throughout the state. MCO had 132 employees test positive for COVID-19. Through contact tracing of those employees, an additional 128 individuals not associated with the airport tested positive for COVID-19 resulting in 260 total positive cases. We appreciate MCO's commitment to working with the Orange County Health Department, the Florida Department of Health and for ensuring best practices are followed for the health and safety of all employees and visitors to the airport," communications director Helen Ferre said Wednesday afternoon.

> The airport has put out a clarification of this article. 500 workers in the last 3 days were tested, 2 came back positive.   260 people associated with the airport through working or close contact with workers have tested positive since the start of the pandemic. 132 of those are workers out of 25,000.  https://twitter.com/MCO/status/1273273033252392961?s=19  This is in direct contrast to the statement made by the Governor. He may have been misinformed. This is still not resolved.  Edit: the article has now been completely changed to reflect the errors mentioned above. The body of the article and headline have all changed.

## ‘A national disgrace’: 40,600 deaths tied to US nursing homes

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/a-national-disgrace-40600-deaths-tied-to-us-nursing-homes/ar-BB14TyJu):

> "What's happening in nursing homes today and other long-term care facilities is a national disgrace," Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer at the AARP, said last week during an event hosted by?Axios. Facilities are required to report those deaths to the state, but officials at the New York State Health Department said only deaths at the facility are included in the public tally to avoid double-counting. At least seven states - including Massachusetts, Florida and Louisiana - track deaths in part by matching the deceased's address to the address of a care facility, potentially leaving out those who were staying at a facility short-term.

> One of my coworkers has a daughter who works in a nursing home. They said their cases kept increasing after they stopped allowing outside visitors, did temperature checks implemented social distancing, etc. Her daughter even got Covid but had almost no symptoms.  Basically health care workers who were asymptomatic, or had very minor symptoms brought this into nursing homes early and there was no testing and no PPE. I do not blame anyone, we did not know enough or have enough testing 3 months ago.

## 'ICUs are full, patients are dying': 3 Alabama counties see largest jump in weekly cases

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/icus-full-patients-dying-alabama-counties-largest-jump/story?id=71295417):

> With nearly 3,000 people diagnosed with the coronavirus, Montgomery County now has more cases than any other county in the state, Dr. Don Williamson, the head of the Alabama State Hospital Association, told ABC News Tuesday. According to the latest data available, some counties have even more worrisome figures: Tuscaloosa County has just one ICU bed available and Montgomery County has only three. Williamson said the most troubling part to him is that Montgomery County health officials have not been able to pinpoint a source of the spread there.
