## Bill Gates: ‘We underestimated the value of masks’

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/bill-gates-we-underestimated-the-value-of-masks.html):

> "Even the medical community are understanding of the importance of masks. You know, it took us several months - most respiratory diseases are coughing diseases. They're not talking or singing diseases. And so we got that one wrong. We underestimated the value of masks." Now, inconsistent mask rules in states and cities and the refusal by large numbers of people, particularly in the U.S., to wear them is contributing to the continued coronavirus spread, many medical professionals say. "We need to get people to understand that things like wearing masks not only help yourself, but help other people," Gates stressed.

## Yelp data shows 60% of business closures due to the coronavirus pandemic are now permanent

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/yelp-data-shows-60percent-of-business-closures-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-are-now-permanent.html):

> "Overall, Yelp's data shows that business closures have continued to rise with a 34% increase in permanent closures since our last report in mid-July," Justin Norman, Yelp's vice president of data science, told CNBC. The September report marks six months since March 1, the date that Yelp considers to be the beginning of the business crisis. The rate of permanent closures has increased 10% since July, now sitting at 54%. Retail saw a similar increase in permanent closures since July, rising 10% to a total of 58% indicated permanent. Different states are also facing varying degrees of closures, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Yelp sees a correlation between states with a high number of closures and states with a high unemployment rate.

## Ab8 COVID-19 Drug Breakthrough: Tiny Antibody Component Completely Neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Virus

Summary of [original article](https://scitechdaily.com/ab8-covid-19-drug-breakthrough-tiny-antibody-component-completely-neutralizes-the-sars-cov-2-virus/):

> This antibody component, which is 10 times smaller than a full-sized antibody, has been used to construct a drug - known as Ab8 - for potential use as a therapeutic and prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2. The tiny antibody component is the variable, heavy chain domain of an immunoglobulin, which is a type of antibody found in the blood. In February, Wei Li, Ph.D., assistant director of Pitt's Center for Therapeutic Antibodies and co-lead author of the research, began sifting through large libraries of antibody components made using human blood samples and found multiple therapeutic antibody candidates, including Ab8, in record time.
