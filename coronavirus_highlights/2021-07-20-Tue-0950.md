## Twitter Suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene for Posting Coronavirus Misinformation

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html?rss=1):

> Twitter took action after President Biden called on social media companies to do more to combat the spread of vaccine misinformation on their platforms. In January, Twitter barred President Donald J. Trump after the company determined that his social media posts played a role in inciting violence during the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Mr. Trump has argued that Twitter and Facebook, which also suspended his account, were censoring him and said the companies required government oversight.

## Virginia is now posting case numbers by vaccination status

Summary of [original article](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-data-insights/covid-19-cases-by-vaccination-status/):

> The number of vaccine breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths are reported with the percentage of these cases out of the total number of fully vaccinated people. This graph displays the 7-day moving average of all cases by date of illness onset, cases meeting the case definition for vaccine breakthrough, and cases not fully vaccinated* at the time of illness. Not fully vaccinated cases and all cases lines may be indistinguishable until the date range is narrowed.

> Amazing. This will be truly invaluable in understanding the efficacy of the vaccines against Delta. Great job VA!
> 
> Edit: Wanted to add that the current 7-day average for not fully vaccinated cases is 241.7 while fully vaccinated stands at 4.6. That's a 98% gap!

## 'If anybody is lying here senator, it is you,' Fauci tells Sen. Paul in heated exchange at Senate hearing

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/if-anybody-is-lying-here-senator-it-is-you-fauci-tells-sen-paul-in-heated-exchange-at-senate-hearing.html):

> White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul traded barbs in a heated exchange at a Senate hearing Tuesday over whether the National Institutes of Health funded controversial research Paul claims could have contributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Paul grilled Fauci about an NIH funded study that he says qualifies as gain-of-function research, the process of altering a pathogen to make it more transmissible in order to better predict emerging diseases. Paul asked Fauci if he would like to retract that statement from the May 11 testimony, "Fauci, as you are aware it is a crime to lie to Congress."

`/u/chriswmf` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oo4944/if_anybody_is_lying_here_senator_it_is_you_fauci/):

> Criminalization of international research collaboration will have profound negative consequences for decades to come.
> 
> And make no mistake, China isn't poor, any US funding, if occurred, would never have been the sole funding or even important funding source.
> 
> Rand Paul needs to stop grandstanding and learn to be honest.
