## Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine backed by independent FDA committee

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303158/covid-vaccine-fda-indepenedent-committee-johnson):

> An independent committee of vaccine experts has unanimously recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Johnson & Johnson one-shot COVID-19 vaccine for people 18 and older, taking it one step closer to use in the United States. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine only takes one dose to give people protection against COVID-19, which makes it easier to distribute than the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, which each need two shots. Johnson & Johnson will also run additional trials to test its vaccine in adolescents, children, and pregnant women.

## Vaccine "scavengers" are waiting outside clinics for leftover doses — and their strategy often works

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/02/26/vaccine-scavengers-are-waiting-outside-clinics-for-leftover-doses--and-their-strategy-often-works/):

> If Kloots' tale of waiting outside a clinic for an extra vaccine to fall off the truck gives you ideas, you're not alone. Many have wondered if waiting outside clinics at the end of the day can yield a free vaccine, one that might otherwise be chucked, or if Kloots' experience was exceptional. Another similar website, HiDrB, was created to match vaccine hunters with vaccine providers in the case that they have to throw out a dose or find an arm.

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-study-95-of-former-covid-patients-suffer-no-irreversible-damage/):

> A new Israeli study released Tuesday indicates that 95 percent of recovered COVID-19 patients do not suffer any irreversible respiratory or cardiac damage, helping to answer one of the key questions about the disease that has infected more than 100 million people worldwide. The study of 166 recovered COVID-19 patients, conducted by Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center, found that 94 percent still reported symptoms three months on, notably shortness of breath, though most symptoms disappeared within six months. 55% of patients reported overall weakness, 25% reported a sustained cough and 18% reported chest pains.
