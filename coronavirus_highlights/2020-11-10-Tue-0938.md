> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

## Dr. Fauci orders takeout several times a week: 'I feel it's almost a neighborly obligation'

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/dr-fauci-orders-takeout-food-from-local-restaurants-few-times-a-week.html):

> As of September, more than 100,000 restaurants and bars had permanently closed in the U.S. due to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in an estimated $240 billion in lost revenue, according to the National Restaurant Association. While many restaurants are now open for in-person indoor dining at reduced capacity, Fauci has said that it is still risky. "If you go indoors in a restaurant - whatever capacity, 25[%], 50%, or what have you - indoors absolutely increases the risk," Fauci told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Sept. 11.
