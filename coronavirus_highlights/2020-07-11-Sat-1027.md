> New research provides evidence that working memory and fluid intelligence are associated with engaging in social distancing in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. "At the moment, successful containment of the COVID-19 outbreak critically relies on people's voluntary compliance with social distancing guidelines. However, there is widespread non-compliance in our society, especially during the early stage of this pandemic," said study author Weiwei Zhang, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. "Our findings reveal a novel cognitive root of social distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic," Zhang said.

> Wow, slam!  It's absolutely no coincidence that Germany has this brilliant woman in charge and has one of the best responses to Covid of any country in the world.  Meanwhile in the US, we have a giant toddler with the attention span of a goldfish throwing temper tantrums on twitter running our response.  Strange how we're heading towards 100K cases and thousands of deaths a day.

## Syracuse, NY: Asymptomatic Child Spread Disease to At least 16 After Being Sent to In-Home Daycare by a Mom Who Didn’t Report Symptoms. Daycare Owner Did Temperature Checks And Sanitized Objects, but Couldn’t Detect or Prevent Spread from Asymptomatic Child.

Summary of [original article](https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/07/at-least-16-sick-after-coronavirus-exposure-at-dewitt-in-home-day-care-take-this-seriously-stay-home-if-sick-at-all.html):

> DeWitt, N.Y. - At least 16 children and adults have come down with the coronavirus after it spread from contact at a DeWitt family in-home child care. "I'm so frustrated that she didn't tell me, and she didn't stay home,'' said Feathers, who had a fever and was sick for eight days."People need to take this seriously, and stay home if they are sick at all. The way the virus spread so easily because people didn't stay home and made so many people sick is why Feathers and a mom whose family got sick are talking about what happened.

> This is what bugs me about solely relying on temp checks and self reporting, you cannot detect the asymptomatic. I’m not saying they should stop as it is important to stop those that are, in fact, symptomatic. I’ve been to the doctor a few times during the pandemic and it’s always the same: temp check and they ask a few questions - symptoms, been out of the country, been in contact with anyone with COVID? My temp is fine and it’s a no to all those questions but I could have lied at any point about any of those.

> Edit: I don’t mean to be rude but a chunk of y’all seem to be missing the point of my post. I never said stop taking temps or asking questions, I even said “I’m not saying they should stop as it is important to stop those that are, in fact, symptomatic.” I am talking about those who are specifically NOT reporting their symptoms because they don’t feel the need to. I would love it if they ADDED a pulse ox test because what if they catch a happy hypoxia?
