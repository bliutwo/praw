> And it isn’t stopping anytime soon. I work in radiology at a Miami hospital and it’s insane. People don’t even want to wear a mask inside a damn hospital? Like how dumb can you be. The other day we literally sent home a patient because she, a 70+ year old lady, literally said she will not wear a mask in here. So that’s where we are at right now. Elderly folks refusing to wear a mask at a hospital. Good luck.

> Alright folks, time to add context to this made-for-media sound byte. This same dude has systematically defunded healthcare, delayed the COVID response, promoted tourism, and catered to anti-maskers since March. He has a 32% approval rating in the province, and is truly among the least respectable provincial leaders.
