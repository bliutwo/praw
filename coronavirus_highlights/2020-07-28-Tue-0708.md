> Saving you a click,
>
> *"A couple who insisted on having 100 guests for their wedding have contracted coronavirus, alongside eight of their friends.*
>
> *The wedding, that took place in early July, was held at the SS Peter and Paul’s Church, which overlooks Washington Square Park in San Francisco, California.*
>
> *The couple* ***also held a rehearsal dinner the night before the event****, which more than 40 guests attended, according to the San Francisco Chronicle."*
>
> *" As the guests were arriving at the venue, an official from the city showed up and told them that it* ***could not go ahead as planned****, because the amount of guests involved violated an executive order in the state.*
>
> *The couple, alongside eight of their guests tested positive for the virus, after they started showing symptoms of Covid-19 within five days of the ceremony.*
>
> *The guest list at the wedding included* ***people travelling*** *from all over the US, including Texas and Arizona, which have both struggled with the pandemic and recorded record cases in the last six weeks."*
>
> So 10 people mainly from the rehearsal dinner, would have probably been worse if the Wedding had gone ahead as scheduled.

## NFL officially cancels 2020 preseason amid coronavirus concerns

> The NFL plan as currently construed is just a disaster waiting to happen.  Their players are free to wander their communities with a variety of outbreak levels.  How many NFL players are virus deniers that are wandering free sans mask and any precautions?  I'm guessing at least a significant minority.  Eventually, some of these typhoid Mary's will slip through the testing regime and infect their teammates and maybe other teams.  They need to establish somewhere between 4-8 bubbles and play out the season in a bubble without fans like the NBA and NHL.  Look at MLB they made it a whole 4 days into their plan, before 1/3 of a team tested positive and it's not a contact sport.

> [Typhoid Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon#Release_and_second_quarantine_\(1915%E2%80%931938\)) spent the last 20 years of her life in quarantine because she refused to stop working as cook and killed dozens. The precedent is there, so these jokers better wise up.
