## Misinformation is bad. Good information is good.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/):

> Here are some good sources of information about COVID-19 that are written to be accessible to the general public. For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

> The moderators of this sub support efforts to more strongly combat COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit. We believe our sub is one of the best places on Reddit, and maybe the internet, to get accurate and timely information on the pandemic, and we take a strong stance against misinformation. In our opinion, it would be counterproductive to make one of the most accurate subs on Reddit private in order to combat misinformation on Reddit. If you would like to discuss the current happenings in regards to subs going private, please do so on this sticky. Feel free to share this post with others who are seeking accurate information. All other meta-drama comments will be removed. Thanks!

## Nicki Minaj’s COVID-19 vaccine tweet about swollen testicles signals the dangers of celebrity misinformation and fandom

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/nicki-minajs-covid-19-vaccine-tweet-about-swollen-testicles-signals-the-dangers-of-celebrity-misinformation-and-fandom-168242):

> MSNBC political commentator Joy Reid expressed concern for Minaj's 22 million Twitter followers, arguing Minaj used her platform "To put people in the position of dying from a disease they don't have to die from." Minaj also tweeted on Sept. 13: "They want you to get vaccinated for the Met.f I get vaccinated it won't for the Met. It'll be once I feel I've done enough research." Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour's event, which Minaj did not attend, required vaccination. While Minaj did tweet that she would eventually get the vaccine to go on tour, her recommendation that others get the vaccine in order to work because a "Lot of countries won't let [people] work w/o the vaccine" reflects the anti-vaxx criticisms against vaccine mandates created to save lives.

> And it's not just big names.
> 
> People are citing Instagram and YouTube videos. Literally anyone can produce a video on these platforms, and they can claim to be experts in any field - and others will blindly follow whatever they say because it confirms their beliefs.
> 
> And this is the "do your research!" crowd.

## Fauci: COVID vaccine could be available for 5-11 year olds in "weeks"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/fauci-covid-vaccine-children-available-weeks-167c6bf8-23a4-4fbb-b1e3-3ffd03f98185.html):

> NIAID director Anthony Fauci told CNN Tuesday that children ages 5-11 could be eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines in the next several weeks. This is a quicker timeline than the one Fauci proposed just days earlier, when he indicated the vaccine could be available to children by Halloween. State of play: Pfizer announced Monday that results from its pediatric trial indicate that its vaccine - in a smaller dosage than given to adults - is safe and effective in children ages 5-11..

## Law Firm Seeks to Take COVID Misinformation Spreaders to Court

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/law-firm-seeks-to-take-covid-misinformation-spreaders-to-court/2723731/):

> Lowe and her late husband Mikel, a San Diego County native and federal firefighter, both believed - and even shared - vaccine misinformation. A recent Center for Countering Digital Hate study identified 12 people responsible for generating more than 65 percent of vaccine misinformation online, the so-called "Disinformation Dozen." Eaton says in order to win these suits, Rothschild will have to prove unvaccinated people who died from COVID due to negligent or intentional actions by misinformers.

## Texas’ ban on school mask mandates draws federal investigation for possibly violating the rights of students with disabilities

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/21/texas-schools-mask-mandates-education-department/):

> The federal government is investigating the Texas Education Agency after deeming that its guidance prohibiting mask mandates in schools last week may be "Preventing school districts in the state from considering or meeting the needs of students with disabilities." The Texas Tribune reached out to Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and Round Rock school districts for comment as well as the Texas State Teachers Association and the Texas Association of School Administrators. Disclosure: Association of Texas Professional Educators, Raise Your Hand Texas, Texas Association of School Administrators and Texas State Teachers Association have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

`/u/ScienceHatHa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pstk9k/texas_ban_on_school_mask_mandates_draws_federal/):

> Mask bans absolutely do violate the rights of kids with disabilities.  It’s not just the kids who are medically fragile.  It’s also the kids who absolutely need one on one in person instruction to learn but who are instead forced out of in person school by rampant uncontrolled Covid transmission forcing school closures and quarantines.
> 
> It’s just by the time this goes through court those kids will be vaccinated and no longer at risk. In the mean time they are on school year 3 that’s been disrupted by Covid.
> 
> Why can’t people just do the right thing to protect kids.

## Mississippi Governor Announces Bold Plan to Do Nothing to Stop COVID

`/u/JLBesq1981` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/psbjec/mississippi_governor_announces_bold_plan_to_do/):

> >That the U.S. has access to vaccines that much of the world does not, and still can’t bring the crisis under control, is owing in large part to the incompetence and recklessness of politicians like Tate Reeves, who won’t stop playing politics with the pandemic, even as the people they were elected to serve die from the virus in stunning numbers. Reeves, the Mississippi governor, is presiding over one of the most devastating outbreaks not just in America, but the world. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, he defended his response, making clear he would not do anything different.“Governor, if Mississippi were a country, you would have the second worst per capita death toll in the world,” a weary-looking Tapper told Reeves. “And I’m saying: Are you going to do anything to try to change that?”“The reality is the Delta variant is very transmissible and it is moving around the country,” Reeves replied after some gibberish about deaths being a “lagging indicator.” “If you want to talk about cases right now, talk about Kentucky or West Virginia or what’s happening in North Carolina or moving into southern Virginia.”
> 
> Doing something about it would require him to admit he was wrong, instead he will just deflect from having the second worst per capita death toll in the world.
