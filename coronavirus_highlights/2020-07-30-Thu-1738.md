> It's fine everything is fine.  The contact tracers just have to work a little harder to trace her contacts and her contacts contacts, contact contacts contacts, etc for only 28 days.  Should be easy, that's probably only a few thousand people.  A test delayed 28 days is basically useless.

## New study links Christian nationalism to going maskless and neglecting to social distance amid the COVID-19 pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/07/new-study-links-christian-nationalism-to-going-maskless-and-neglecting-to-social-distance-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic-57514):

> Christian nationalism shapes Americans' responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak, according to new research that analyzed data from 2,519 individuals. The study, which can be viewed for free in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, indicates that those who embrace Christian nationalist ideology are more likely to flout measures intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. He's the guy who sticks up for the values of "Americans like us," and so Trump's resistance to mask-wearing and skepticism toward experts was going to bring Christian nationalist Americans with him.

> Jesus would have worn a mask, because he actually cared about other people and setting a good example. Also, he could walk on water and make a lot of fish out of a little bit of fish, and those are just his marine-related tricks.
