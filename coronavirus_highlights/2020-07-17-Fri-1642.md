## ‘OSHA is AWOL’: Critics say federal agency is where workplace COVID-19 complaints go to die

Summary of [original article](https://www.tampabay.com/news/2020/07/16/osha-is-awol-critics-say-federal-agency-is-where-workplace-covid-19-complaints-go-to-die/):

> "Essentially, OSHA is AWOL," said David Michaels, a former head of OSHA under the Obama administration who now teaches at George Washington University's school of public health. "The OSHA response to this crisis has been horrible. There's been more complaints filed with OSHA in the past four months than any previous four months," said Peter Dooley, a certified industrial hygienist with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, a federation of private, non-profit coalitions that advocates for worker health and safety. Overall, OSHA had received 208 COVID-19 related complaints and opened 19 inspections in Florida as of June 24, a spokesperson said.

> The entire system is broken. It feels like every single one of these systems are pure lip service except for the rare occasion where things are taken seriously.

## Florida teen met friends against family’s wishes. Now dad has COVID-19, fighting for his life

Summary of [original article](http://globalnews.ca/news/7188224/florida-dad-coronavirus-teen/):

> One evening in early June, the young man went out against her wishes, gathered with friends and removed his mask while eating and drinking. The illness's spread among members of the Plantation, Fla., family highlights the outcome dreaded by authorities who feared the recent surge of cases hitting younger Floridians would spread to older, more vulnerable people. South Florida mayors gathered earlier this week with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and told him that gatherings of young people were a key factor in the rise in cases that emerged in June in their region.

> This is another casualty that people are not thinking about. The unbearable guilt so many people are going to feel that brought the coronavirus home to loved ones who then died from it. I'm not talking about the unfortunate people that have to work in healthcare or in grocery stores or in that kind of thing though you would still feel guilty. I'm talking about this, young people going out and defying science to prove that they are immortal. And then finding out maybe they are, but their dad or grandma or sister is not.

## Not extending $600 unemployment benefit 'would be a catastrophe,' say former Fed Chairs Bernanke and Yellen

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/not-extending-600-unemployment-benefit-would-be-catastrophe-say-former-n1234216):

> "I think, frankly, it would be a catastrophe not to extend unemployment insurance," Janet Yellen told members of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis during a remote hearing on Friday. During the pandemic, Bernanke and Yellen have emerged as outspoken advocates for aggressive government response, by both the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress. Anticipating pushback from Republican members who have said extending jobless benefits would disincentivize the unemployed from looking for work, Bernanke and Yellen proposed tying unemployment insurance to the unemployment rate, "Thereby creating an automatic stabilizer." They also suggested benefits "Could be based on the individual's pre-unemployment wages."

`/u/HugeHouseplant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ht3fc2/not_extending_600_unemployment_benefit_would_be_a/):

> Any benefit should be paid to everyone under a certain income level, not just people who are out of work.
> 
> I’m essential enough to know that people on unemployment aren’t the only ones struggling.

## Every U.S. state is accumulating new virus cases at a faster clip than Canada. Yep, all 50.

Summary of [original article](https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/every-u-s-state-is-accumulating-new-virus-cases-at-a-faster-clip-than-canada-yep-all-50/):

> On a per capita basis, the coronavirus crisis in the United States is so bad that all 50 states are logging more new cases than Canada is. Even New York, where residents are relieved to have the worst days of the first wave behind them, new cases are popping up at a level near quadruple that of Canada. In the worst week for new cases in Québec in late April and early May, the province averaged 946 cases per day, according to data compiled by CBC News.

`/u/LargeSnorlax` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hsvol6/every_us_state_is_accumulating_new_virus_cases_at/):

> Well... yeah. Of course they are. 
> 
> The US is getting almost as many cases *per day* as Canada **has gotten total**. 
> 
> Think about that. And Canada hasn't handled the situation particularly well either (Though obviously better than the USA) so we're no shining star, we're still top 20 in the world in deaths despite a smaller population.
