## Not having the vaccine is the biggest mistake of my life

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-57866661):

> Although few of them end up in hospital, our patients are younger now on average than in earlier waves, with more in their 30s and 40s."Some have had two vaccines and so have had milder disease - they are alive on Cpap when without the vaccine they would probably be dead," my respiratory colleague Dr Abid Aziz told me after an exhausting six-hour ward round. For many of the patients who have not been vaccinated, being admitted with severe Covid is an alarm call to the deadly consequences of fake news about Covid and vaccines. Faisal admits being influenced by conversations on social media, and the worries about the vaccine in the city's Asian community, as well as news reports about the extremely low risk of blood clots with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

`/u/k1llfasheverywhere` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/om17nh/not_having_the_vaccine_is_the_biggest_mistake_of/):

> My dad (whom I havent spoken to in years) is convinced that anyone who gets the mRNA vaccines is going to die in ~3 years. He called my sister raving about how she better not get the vaccine, its gonna kill her, etc. She told him that her and I already got the Pfizer vaccine and he hasn't spoken to her since. Good riddance?

## Canada surpasses US in percentage of fully vaccinated against Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-07-17-21/h_1fc3c40ee66f6d9bd216f266843c9687):

> "People who are immunocompromised should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines and to follow?current prevention measures?(including wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others?staying they don't live with, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces) to protect themselves against COVID-19 until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider," according to the CDC's website. The CDC did not go so far as to tell the millions of immunocompromised people in the US to get an additional shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, noting that "The safety, efficacy and benefit of additional doses for COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised persons continues to be evaluated." On Friday, the CDC said data suggest the response to the vaccines might be reduced for several groups, including organ transplant recipients, people who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, people who have certain blood cancers, and people receiving dialysis or taking certain medications that suppress the immune system.

`/u/Rabash` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/om75pu/canada_surpasses_us_in_percentage_of_fully/):

> Not only Canada. There are many countries in Europe that have also surpassed the US in that regard.

## How Covid-19 Has Upended Life in Undervaccinated Arkansas

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/us/arkansas-covid-19-vaccine.html):

`/u/Poison-Pen-` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/omcpwz/how_covid19_has_upended_life_in_undervaccinated/):

> I’m going to post the whole article in a min, but what I really wanted to share is exactly what I thought would happen:
> 
> *Linda Marion, 68, a widow with chronic pulmonary disease, worried that a vaccination might actually trigger Covid-19 and kill her. Barbara Billigmeier, 74, an avid golfer who retired here from California, believed she did not need it because “I never get sick.”*
> 
> *Last week, all three were patients on 2 West, an overflow ward that is now largely devoted to treating Covid-19 at Baxter Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in north-central Arkansas. Mrs. Billigmeier said the scariest part was that “you can’t breathe.” For 10 days, Ms. Johnson had relied on supplemental oxygen being fed to her lungs through nasal tubes.*
> 
> *Ms. Marion said that at one point, she felt so sick and frightened that she wanted to give up. “It was just terrible,” she said. “I felt like I couldn’t take it.”*
> 
> *Yet despite their ordeals, none of them changed their minds about getting vaccinated. “It’s just too new,” Mrs. Billigmeier said. “It is like an experiment.”*
> 
> Unless they die, they won’t be changing their mind. Many are lost causes and just here to take up resources and infect others.

> 
> "People are stupid" doesn't really explain it. There's something that's gone terribly, terribly wrong in the way some Americans process information.
