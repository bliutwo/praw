> 6 FEET OF DISTANCE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO STOP SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS. EXPERTS: 90% OF CORONAVIRUS DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. HERE'S WHEN IT'S SAFE FOR YOUR STATE TO REOPEN. ADVERTISEMENT. Fauci put part of the blame on leadership, but said "Sometimes, when the leadership calls out for people to obey certain types of guidelines, they don't do it." Fauci said the problem doesn't lie with guidance from local leaders as leadership has actually given the right guidelines, but says people, for one reason or another, people "Don't believe it or [are] not fazed by it." He noted that there's a type of anti-science trend in the country that may be contributing to the disregard of advice from health experts. "It's the kind of mistrust of science because science is viewed as authority. And there's a lot of anti-authority feeling. I think that's the kind of thing that drives the anti-vaxxers, the people who don't believe the science of vaccination and don't want to get their children vaccinated," Fauci said, calling it "Very disturbing."

> There are no specific definitions for classifying a second wave or a second peak of coronavirus, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, said during a briefing on Friday. "You may have a second peak within your first wave. And then you may have a second wave. It's not either or," Ryan warned. "The second peak depends on how good, how strong and how effective the control you have over the disease at this present moment. If you start to experience a second peak, then the chances are that the disease is spreading in a way that you have not got full control over that," Ryan said.

> NASHVILLE - Kid Rock's bar in Nashville has been hit with a permit suspension by the state for ignoring social distancing rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Metropolitan Beer Permit Board in Tennessee voted to issue a five-day permit suspension to Kid Rock's Big Honky Tonk & Steakhouse and three other bars in downtown Nashville for ignoring distancing guidelines, the Nashville Tennessean reports. Photos circulating social media last week showed the bar seemingly packed with patrons unable to comply with social distancing guidelines and sitting at the bar itself, which is currently banned in the county.
