## Texas hospitals are running out of drugs, beds, ventilators and even staff

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/14/texas-hospitals-coronavirus/):

> The hospitals are nearly out of ventilators and are starting to consider older models and disaster ventilators that are less optimal for treating the virus, he said. Short-staffed West Texas hospitals have been forced to turn away patients from rural areas, where small regional hospitals lack the resources to treat the sickest patients. Disclosure: The Texas College of Emergency Physicians, the University of Texas System, the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals, and Parkland Health and Hospital System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

## Ted Cruz Under Investigation For Not Wearing A Mandatory Mask On Flight

Summary of [original article](https://www.politicususa.com/2020/07/13/ted-cruz-mask-flight.html):

> American Airlines has announced that they are investigating Sen. Ted Cruz after he was caught not wearing a mandatory mask on a flight. I just confirmed that none of the American flight attendants on the flight said anything to Cruz about him not wearing a mask, in clear violation of American's rules. American Airlines has banned other passengers for refusing to wear a mask on a flight, but nothing was done as Ted Cruz violated the policy and flew without a mask.

> It is sickening to see an airlines failure to request him to wear a mask or deny him entrance to the cabin like they would do to anyone else.
> 
> They endangered the lives of 100s other passengers by allowing this to happen.

## This ‘pro-vax’ campaign encourages vaccine-supporting Americans to do more to fight anti-vaxxers

Summary of [original article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90520997/this-provax-campaign-encourages-vaccine-supporting-americans-to-do-more-to-fight-anti-vaxxers):

> A new advocacy campaign is designed to mobilize the majority to speak out to help fight misinformation, at a time when the end of the current pandemic will hinge in part on the public's willingness to be vaccinated. Public health officials haven't always understood how much damage anti-vax groups could do, says Joe Smyser, CEO of Public Good Projects, the nonprofit leading the new campaign. The new campaign aims to activate the majority of the public who do support vaccines, educating them on the latest strands of misinformation that are circulating online and giving them the facts to be able to make persuasive counterarguments.

> Good. I say something when people bring that nonsense to the table. Don’t keep your mouth shut about this subject. It really is insane.

## Texas Teachers Writing Their Wills as State Promises to Open Schools in Fall

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-teachers-writing-their-wills-state-promises-open-schools-fall-1517493):

> After Texas Governor Greg Abbott unveiled a plan in June to reopen his state's schools, some teachers have said holding in-person classes while the coronavirus still poses a threat could place them in danger. In a Monday statement, the Houston Federation of Teachers called the plan for reopening Texas schools "Unacceptably vague and hardly adequate." In El Paso, Texas schools are not expected to open for in-person classes until September due to an order from city-county health authority Dr. Hector Ocaranza.

> Or...they could just not show up. This is *precisely* why unions were born, and precisely when they are needed.
> 
> If no teachers show up, what is Texas going to do? Fire them all? Hire some scabs from across the border?
> 
> Collective Bargaining, people. Illegal to unionize? I'm gonna use the same argument so many Texans love to use in regards to the 2nd Amendment:

> *When they tell you that you can't have* *~~guns~~* *unions, that's exactly when you need them.*

> I've basically sheltering in place for like 3 months already and it looks like there's still no near end to this.
