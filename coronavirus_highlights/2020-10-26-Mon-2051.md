> I had to summon ambulance yesterday in WrocÅ‚aw since I was experiencing probably a stroke, and can confirm: I got admitted to the hospital (on of the bigger), but only after spending 5 hours in ambulance. Then I spent following 12 hours in triage area, occupying one of two non-covid beds, while covid patients were rolling in one after another for the whole night. PPE is missing, equipment is missing, urgent care is not conducted. When a guy arrived with crash leg this morning the trauma docs were louldy considering operating there and then in the hallway, right before our eyes (didn't come to this). Management is shifting blame, and can't be reached. This is a hospital co-run by military - and the commendant was not to be reached. It's a shit show. At one point nurses threatened to step away from patients beds if the management won't offer any measures to manage influx of patients. They seemed to accept their risk but didn't want to accept more patients without being able to help them. From what I overheard on CB radio - this was same in most other hospitals.
