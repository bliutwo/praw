She told me today that she and my stepdad are going to the movies tomorrow. I asked her to please wear a mask and she started spewing every right-wing nonsense Fox News and OANN teach their base. Anyways, it resulted in her saying she doesn't need to wear one because our home city is "fine."

> I asked her if she'd wear a mask if Trump or the governor made them wear one and she paused, eventually saying, "Yeah, I guess." Well mom, now you get to wear a mask.
