## ‘All People’ Should Avoid Cruise Ships, CDC Warns

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/cdc-warning-all-people-should-avoid-cruise-ships.html):

> At the end of October, amid another surge of COVID-19 cases, the CDC lifted its ban on cruise ships sailing in U.S. waters. Earlier this month, cruise company SeaDream reported that the coronavirus had spread on the first cruise ship to set sail in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic. The Miami Herald reports that no government or independent agency is gathering publicly available data on cruise ship outbreaks, but their own analysis indicates that 3,908 people have contracted the virus on a cruise, resulting in 111 deaths.

`/u/flyingpig104` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jzwmfn/all_people_should_avoid_cruise_ships_cdc_warns/):

> I’m fascinated by the idea of who would voluntarily go on a cruise right now.  The Petri dishiness of it all.  The likelihood of ending up in quarantine.  And knowing that you’d be on a boat full of weirdos who decided to go on a mid-pandemic cruise.
