## It’s 2:30 a.m. in Wyoming: ‘You’re holding a smartphone to let a husband say goodbye to his wife via FaceTime after 60 years of marriage’

> COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, started disrupting families and ravaging lives far from the metropolitan counties, especially in the southern and midwestern states such as Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. North Dakota has 167 COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while Wyoming has 140 coronavirus infections per 100,000, followed by South Dakota with 124,000 cases per 100K, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. All of a sudden, it is 2:30 a.m., and you are holding a smartphone to let a husband say goodbye to his wife via FaceTime after 60 years of marriage."

> This has been a public messaging disaster.  We literally watched NYC burn down with the COVID in the Spring, and yet communities across the US were somehow convinced their communities were immune.

## ‘All People’ Should Avoid Cruise Ships, CDC Warns

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/cdc-warning-all-people-should-avoid-cruise-ships.html):

> At the end of October, amid another surge of COVID-19 cases, the CDC lifted its ban on cruise ships sailing in U.S. waters. Earlier this month, cruise company SeaDream reported that the coronavirus had spread on the first cruise ship to set sail in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic. The Miami Herald reports that no government or independent agency is gathering publicly available data on cruise ship outbreaks, but their own analysis indicates that 3,908 people have contracted the virus on a cruise, resulting in 111 deaths.

> I’m fascinated by the idea of who would voluntarily go on a cruise right now.  The Petri dishiness of it all.  The likelihood of ending up in quarantine.  And knowing that you’d be on a boat full of weirdos who decided to go on a mid-pandemic cruise.

## ‘Florida is a hot mess’: Nurses union raises alarm as coronavirus spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/11/23/florida-is-a-hot-mess-nurses-union-raises-alarm-as-coronavirus-spreads/):

> Nurses from six of the country's coronavirus hotspots, including Florida, held a news conference Monday, pleading with hospital administrators, government leaders and the general public to take COVID-19 more seriously. National Nurses United, the country's largest union for registered nurses, has been vocal since the pandemic's start. There are now four full-time nurses on that floor; the rest are contract or travel nurses.

> •••
> >Problems are prevalent in Florida hospitals, including those the Tampa Bay region, said Marisa Lee, a longtime labor and delivery nurse at Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee. Her hospital and others continue to force nurses to reuse disposable face masks and work on floors they don’t have the training for, she said.
> 
> >Hospitals aren’t testing every patient for the virus, Lee added, and they aren’t testing nurses unless they have symptoms. Patients who are awaiting test results are housed near other patients who do not have the virus, and nurses who have been exposed aren’t being told by management. Those who test positive but do not have symptoms are made to come to work, Lee said.
> 
> >Meanwhile, coronavirus patients are pouring in. About a quarter of Florida’s regular and intensive care unit beds were available Monday afternoon, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration.
> 
> >”Florida is a hot mess,” Lee said. “Florida is wide open with no restrictions of any kind. We have already had many COVID patients and yes, those numbers are exponentially increasing.”
> 
> >The unsafe working conditions have caused many nurses to quit, the union said. At Osceola Regional, 15 emergency room nurses have left and 20 quit from the medical-surgical floor, which has become the COVID-19 unit, Lee said. There are now four full-time nurses on that floor; the rest are contract or travel nurses.

## PM says Covid vaccine won't be compulsory but slams anti-vax 'propaganda'

Summary of [original article](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/boris-johnson-says-covid-19-19333253):

> No one will be forced to take the coronavirus vaccine - but people should be encouraged to take the vital new drug despite anti-vaccination propaganda, Boris Johnson has said. "Mr Johnson said:"We think it's a good idea - I totally reject the propaganda of the anti-vaxxers; they are wrong - vulnerable people, people who need a vaccine should definitely get a vaccine. Prof Pollard said that clinical trial results showed the vaccine offered around 70% protection: there were 30 cases of Covid in people who had two doses of the vaccine and 101 cases in people who received a fake control injection.

`/u/rdrunner_74` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k03ce4/pm_says_covid_vaccine_wont_be_compulsory_but/):

> There is a difference between making it mandatory, and requiring it for "certain actions". I am in favor of the later.
> 
> I would love to see the whole school be vaccinated, but thats alomst impossible to implement here (School is mandatory so you cant force vaccine)
> 
> Edit: Last year we managed to get some Kindergärten to "require it", but only private ones.
