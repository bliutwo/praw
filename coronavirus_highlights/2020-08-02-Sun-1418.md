## Dr. Fauci Says Early Results from Coronavirus Vaccine Are 'Very Good News'

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/health/phase-1-results-in-experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-prove-promising/):

> The experimental coronavirus vaccine was "Generally well tolerated and prompted neutralizing antibody activity in healthy adults," according to Phase 1 findings. Early test results from a prospective novel coronavirus vaccine could be a positive sign, researchers say, and Dr. Anthony Fauci calls the Phase 1 trial "Very good news." Dr. Fauci pointed out that "The companies, both Moderna and other companies that are involved with the development of vaccines, promise that as we get into 2021, there'll be an ample supply because they're going to start making the doses imminently. By the beginning of the year we should have the first tens of millions and then hundreds of millions of doses. That being the case, I would think we could vaccinate a substantial portion of the population as we get into 2021 - if the vaccine is safe and effective."

> Half of the participants reported “fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia or pain at the injection site”. The operative word there is *or*..  they did not report *all* of those listed side effects. Regardless, pain at the injection site is very common with nearly every existing vaccine as are most of the other side effects reported here. I will gladly roll the dice any day with the chance of having a headache or a sore arm for possible protection against COVID.

## White House opposes requirement for passengers to wear masks on planes, trains

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airlines-idUSKCN24V3NC):

> WASHINGTON - The White House on Thursday said it opposed language in a bill before Congress that would require airline, train and public transit passengers and workers to wear masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. The White House Office of Management and Budget called the provision in a U.S. House of Representatives spending bill requiring the masks "Overly restrictive." It added that "Such decisions should be left to states, local governments, transportation systems, and public health leaders." Airlines, Amtrak and most public transit systems and U.S. airports require all passengers and workers to wear facial coverings.

> As a teacher, I’m nearly in tears reading this article. I am very thankful to be in an area where the surge has come down - but how long will that last? He is right, so many people are indulging in a fantasy of a “new normal,” because the alternative (another year or more of being stuck at home) is awful. But how are people going to feel when teachers and kids start dying in their districts? My heart goes out to this man. He is in an impossible situation.

## Antibody tests do not pick up people who had mild coronavirus, Oxford study suggests

`/u/Mikezpo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/i29w7u/antibody_tests_do_not_pick_up_people_who_had_mild/):

> I'm an ITU Nurse in a central London hospital that was one the major ones taking the first wave of covid patients.
> I worked non stop during the whole period, full PPE all the time, and I felt fine. Due to the first FP3 mask we were using I got really bruised on my nose, and during the day I couldn't breath through my nose. At the time I did lose sense of smell and taste, but that wasn't classified as a symptom yet, and to be honest, with everything happening around you, it kinda gets unnoticed. Last month we did the antibody test, and voilà it came up positive, so apparently I contracted the virus.
> So after this covid-19 pandemic, not only did I get extremely exhausted, stressed, with constant insomnia (due to the alarms of monitors and ventilators in my head even at home), but I got a bonus of antibodies. And yet, even after all of this, there won't be ANY pay rise for nurses. Gotta love this country ❤️💔

## An anti-mask cult in Illinois might spread coronavirus across the country

Summary of [original article](https://bgr.com/2020/08/02/coronavirus-transmission-outdoors-anti-face-mask-cult-tent-chicago/):

> A cult has been hosting meetings in a tent in Des Plaines, Illinois, ignoring social distancing and face mask mandates despite local laws. Des Plaines has asked the cult to follow state mandates regarding COVID-19, including face masks and social distancing, but the people attending the events have ignored them, Sondergaard included. Without abiding protection guidelines, Sondergaard's cult risks turning into another significant cluster and causing similar outbreaks in other parts of the country where he and his followers plan to travel next.

`/u/RentalGore` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/i2c4yr/an_antimask_cult_in_illinois_might_spread/):

> This guy basically escaped Denmark because they started looking into his illegal dealings and teachings.  
> 
> He believes autism is caused by demons and that homosexuality can be “cured” by being drowned in large trash cans.
> 
> He came here to my state in North Carolina last year and wanted to build a second Noah’s Ark.
> 
> He’s insane...he’s a cult leader and he’s dangerous.
