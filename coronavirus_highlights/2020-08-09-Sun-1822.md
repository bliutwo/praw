## ‘This is unstoppable’: America's midwest braces itself for a Covid-19 surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/covid-19-us-midwest-masks-missouri-iowa):

> Coronavirus deaths in the midwest remain a fraction of the nearly 160,000 recorded during the pandemic across the US. But Missouri is second only to Oklahoma in the number of new positive tests for the virus over the past two weeks. Modeling by the PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia shows that coronavirus cases are likely to rise sharply across the midwest through August. Some in the midwest thought they had escaped the worst of the pandemic as coronavirus leapt across the country from Washington state to New York and the northeast, and then swallowed the south.

`/u/Takatotyme` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/i6kzqp/almost_100_more_babies_test_positive_for_covid19/):

> My mom is from Corpus Christi, and yesterday she went on a huge rant about how children are having their childhoods torn from them because they have to wear masks at school. When I pointed out that wearing a mask is about 1000x better than dying or being so sick you have to go to a PICU on life support (I work in the PICU at Phoenix Children's hospital in AZ, you could say I know what I'm talking about), my entire family jumped down my throat about how we don't protect our kids from pedophiles in this country. It is so frustrating having conservative parents who don't give a shit what science shows. Do I show them this article or nah?
