> More than one-third of the young people, who had gone to Spain for a party holiday with a youth travel organisation, and who tested negative before departure has now tested positive upon arrival in Belgium. Hundreds of young people were brought back earlier by youth travel organisation Summer Bash after various travellers tested positive during several youth vacations in popular Spanish party destinations, and were tested again on Saturday at Ghent University Hospital, where the buses arrived. Following their PCR test in Ghent, the young travellers went into quarantine, usually at their parents' houses, for seven days if they tested negative, after which they will be tested again.

## Canada to reach 55M vaccine doses by week's end, catching up to U.S. on second doses

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/canada-to-reach-55m-vaccine-doses-by-week-s-end-catching-up-to-u-s-on-second-doses-1.5505478):

> Published Monday, July 12, 2021 4:39AM EDT Last Updated Monday, July 12, 2021 4:39AM EDT. OTTAWA - Canada is expecting vaccine shipments to keep rolling in this week as the country inches closer to matching the percentage of people in the United States fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The federal government has promised that it would reach 68 million shots delivered by the end of July and says it's still on track to hit that target.

> Once we finally started getting steady supply of vaccines, the campaign took off like a Falcon 9. All expectations were shattered, we're still on pace to be done with second doses by the end of this month. I got my second dose last week, over 2 months earlier than my original appointment and 3 months ahead of Trudeau's goal. Most provinces are reporting barely a trickle of new cases per day, Quebec only has around 700 active ones and barely 80 people still in hospital; out of a population of 8.3 million. We're rapidly approaching a point where most public health restrictions won't be needed anymore, because any outbreaks can be easily traced back and don't run the risk of spiraling out of control.
> 
> EDIT: adding this since it just got reported, but Ontario (largest province with 14+ million people) reported NO deaths for the first time I can remember, and only 114 new cases. Sunday numbers of course, but still. Things are going exceptionally well across the country. Go team!

## Canada to donate almost 18 million surplus AstraZeneca doses to low- and middle-income countries

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covax-donations-astrazeneca-surplus-1.6099072):

> Canada is donating an additional 17.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to help inoculate people in low- and middle-income countries, federal ministers announced Monday. The program pools funds from wealthier countries to buy vaccines for those countries and ensure that low- and middle-income countries have access to vaccines as well. The federal government also announced it was partnering with UNICEF in a matching fundraising campaign designed to encourage Canadians to donate a vaccine by contributing $10. All donations by Canadians will be matched by the federal government up to a maximum of $10 million.

`/u/Nikiaf` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oitbn3/canada_to_donate_almost_18_million_surplus/):

> The cynic will say that this is coming a little late, but it is what it is. At least we're finally making good on helping the rest of the world. AZ is a highly effective vaccine, and these \~18 million doses will likely save even more lives than that.
