> Using worldmeter, the US has approx 134,000 deaths as of today and Canada 8,700. It's very hard to take solace in our lowering death count with those numbers already in the history books.

His new film, Greyhound, was originally due to be released in cinemas but will now be screened on Apple TV instead. Many cinemas around the world remain closed to slow the spread of infections amid the pandemic, but they are now allowed to open in the UK. "We are all heartbroken that this movie is not playing in cinemas," Hanks told AFP. "But with that removed as a possibility, we were left with this as a reality." In another interview with Reuters, Hanks said Greyhound was made for "a big, massive, immersive experience that can really only come out when you're in a movie theatre with at least 100 other people".

## Fauci says it's a "false narrative" to take comfort in lower coronavirus death rate

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/fauci-coronavirus-death-rate-c763343d-15d2-4bef-bd7f-38109926c229.html):

> Anthony Fauci said at an event with Sen. Doug Jones on Tuesday "That it's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death" from the coronavirus in the U.S., warning: "There's so many other things that are dangerous and bad about the virus. Don't get into false complacency." This has been one contributing factor in the lower death rate the U.S. has experienced during the recent surge in cases, since "The younger you are, the better you do, and the less likely you're gonna get seriously ill and die," Fauci said. Another reason for the lower death rate is that treatments and therapies for those with advanced coronavirus symptoms have improved in the U.S., Fauci said.

> I don't want to be that guy but I have no problem wearing a mask at work. I unload trucks for Home Depot and while it is definitely more uncomfortable, I'm not sure that it's more difficult. I'm not in great shape, I smoke and I feel that if I can wear a mask unloading a truck in South Texas, it cannot possibly be that big of a deal to wear one shopping or at a desk job. My wife, works at a clinic. All of their clients have to wait in a line outside the facility, it's nearly 100 degrees every day here. And people really want to complain about wearing a mask inside an air conditioned building?
