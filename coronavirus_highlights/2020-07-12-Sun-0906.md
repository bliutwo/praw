## Fauci is sidelined by the White House as he steps up blunt talk on pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/11/fauci-trump-coronavirus/):

> During a Fox News interview Thursday with Sean Hannity, Trump said Fauci "Is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes." And when Greta Van Susteren asked him last week about Fauci's assessment that the country was not in a good place, Trump said flatly: "I disagree with him." Fauci no longer briefs Trump and is "Never in the Oval [Office] anymore," said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. People who are close to Fauci say the public undermining of scientists and public health experts has frustrated and saddened him because it adds to the chaos the country is already experiencing from the pandemic.

`/u/Balgor1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hpkfif/fauci_is_sidelined_by_the_white_house_as_he_steps/):

> “Dr. Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public but he has been wrong about everything I have ever interacted with him on,” Navarro said. “Now Fauci is saying that a falling mortality rate doesn’t matter when it is the single most important statistic to help guide the pace of our economic reopening. So when you ask me if I listen to Dr. Fauci’s advice, my answer is only with caution.”
> 
> Hmm, who would you trust an economist (Note: I'm actually an economist, guess what I can interpret a statistical model with the best of them, but T-cells?  Antibodies?  Fauci knows more than 100 economists combined about the behavior of infectious diseases) or a career scientist with hundreds and hundreds of paper on infectious diseases authored or co-authored?  Besides Navarro is an economist he should be conversant with using lagged data and deaths are extremely lagged.
> 
> Right now it appears they have sidelined their most experienced voice and are listening to an Navarro an economist, Jared whose sole qualification is he married Ivanka, Birx who has given up any semblance of scientific objectivity, and Giroir who seems like a decent military guy but is over his head.  A real president would have established a scientific task force of elite infectious disease doctors (like Fauci) and epidemiologists and put them in charge, not a bunch of family members and political hacks.

## CDC documents warned full reopening of schools, colleges would be ‘highest risk’ for spreading coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/cdc-documents-warned-full-reopening-of-schools-colleges-would-be-highest-risk-for-spreading-coronavirus-nyt/):

> Internal documents from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that fully reopening K-12 schools and universities would be the "Highest risk" for the spread of coronavirus, according to a New York Times report, as President Donald Trump and his administration push for students and teachers to return in-person to classrooms. The document was circulated this week, the Times reported, as Trump slammed the CDC guidelines around reopening schools and he, Vice President Mike Pence and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos increased their pressure on schools to fully reopen by the fall. The document, mostly comprised of CDC documents already publicly available, mentions reopening plans from states, districts, and individual schools and universities, identifying some proposals as consistent with CDC guidance and criticizing the "Noticeable gaps" in other plans, the Times reported.
