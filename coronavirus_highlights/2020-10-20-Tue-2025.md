> What's SO infuriating is that some people keep making the false choice of "total 'freedom' vs total lockdown.'  If we would just agree to the relatively small things - mandatory masks, severe limitations on indoor bars and restaurants (and another round of PPP for those bars & restaurants), massive testing - we could live with this.
> 
> Instead the Trumpettes confuse common sense with oppressive-Communism, so they rebel against minor restrictions and keep putting us in a situation where we have to go into major restrictions. To say nothing of all the suffering and death that happens along the way.

## 'People are dying every night': Staff at overwhelmed Wisconsin hospital urge people to take coronavirus seriously

Summary of [original article](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/10/19/aspirus-wausau-hospital-staff-urge-wisconsin-take-covid-seriously/3669849001/):

> As of Friday, a record 1,101 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus in Wisconsin, including 274 people in intensive care units. "We have been adding a lot of beds. We have about 98 beds throughout the system that are COVID-designated and we only have about 18 left, so that means we have about 80 people in COVID right now that are pretty sick," said Matthew Heywood, CEO and president at Aspirus. Seeing people in the broader community not taking the virus seriously is especially difficult for staff members.

> The fact that hospital staff has to repeat the same plea every day for more than half a year is disheartening. Yet people would find themselves surprised facing the virus like "I thought it was a joke".
> 
> And we have a guy with loudest voice be like "everyone can make it, do not worry"
> 
> Edit: can't reply to almost everyone but thanks for sharing your stories! It is unlikely that people will change their mind this far into the pandemic so take care of yourself and stay safe!

> Well, if immunity only lasts a few months, that totally throws any natural herd immunity strategy out the window.  Of course, the people promoting it won't care, it was never about addressing the virus.
