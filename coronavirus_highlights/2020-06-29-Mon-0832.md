## Europeans' trust in US as world leader collapses during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/29/europeans-trust-in-us-as-world-leader-collapses-during-pandemic):

> The report states: "Europeans' trust in the US is gone. Many have been appalled by the [US's] chaotic response to Covid-19; the lack of solidarity it showed with Europeans in the 12 March closure of its border to members of the Schengen area; and its lack of leadership in tackling the coronavirus crisis at the global level - or even engagement with the issue." The ECFR's analysis suggests the shift in European attitudes transcends hostility to Donald Trump or his administration's poor handling of the virus outbreak in the US. Its authors believe there is now a more profound uncertainty about America as a force for good, America's commitment to multilateralism and the US's ability to lead the world. Without the US at the head of the multilateral system, the authors conclude, Europeans want the EU to take more "Ownership" of international challenges such as the pandemic and the climate emergency.

## America and United Airlines will end social distancing. Will now book flights to full capacity. Is this a joke?

Summary of [original article](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/6/26/21305022/american-united-airlines-end-social-distancing?fbclid=IwAR0PZRwEJ3seyHLW53C7AStVi9EAyGrBIKL_AJo8AjUdrIxlLQG4YqOT60w):

> American Airlines will start booking flights to full capacity in the coming week, ending any effort to promote social distancing on its planes even as the United States sets records for new reported cases of the coronavirus. Photos and videos of full flights on American and United have drawn criticism for their lack of social distancing. American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said the airline has been considering booking to full capacity for a few weeks as passenger numbers have risen.

> We do know that Millennials and younger Americans are getting pummeled once again in this crisis. Millennials never recovered from the Great Recession and this economic contraction is hitting them even harder. Another 35.4 percent own stock indirectly through retirement accounts, and finally 13.9 percent directly own stocks.

## Covid-19 Drug Remdesivir to Cost $3,120 for Typical Patient on Private Insurance

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-drug-remdesivir-to-cost-3-120-for-typical-patient-on-private-insurance-11593428402):

> Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD 1.21% detailed its pricing plans for Covid-19 drug remdesivir, saying it will charge U.S. hospitals $3,120 for a typical patient with commercial insurance. The U.S. has been distributing remdesivir donated by Gilead since the drug was authorized for emergency use in May. Under the company's plans, Gilead will charge a higher price for patients with private insurance in the U.S., and a lower price for U.S. government health programs like Medicare and all other developed countries that insure their patients directly. Remdesivir is the first antiviral drug shown to be effective at treating Covid-19 in a major clinical trial, reducing patients' recovery times by four days compared with the placebo group in a large study funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

> From a similar npr article
> 
> If the price is based just on the cost of making the drug, then a 10-day course of remdesivir should cost about $10, according to the ICER report. (Gilead said results of a recently completed study suggest a five-day course of treatment may be just as effective.)
> 
> But if the drug is priced based on the drug's effectiveness, ICER estimates it should cost around $4,500 — assuming the drug is proven to have some benefit on mortality. If it doesn't and the drug only shortens hospital stays, that value-based price goes down to $390.
