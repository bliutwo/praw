> Study: 100% face mask use could crush second, third COVID-19 wave. "We show that, when face masks are used by the public all the time, the effective reproduction number, Re, can be decreased below 1, leading to the mitigation of epidemic spread," the scientists wrote in the paper published Wednesday by the Proceedings of the Royal Society A.The modeling indicated that when lockdown periods are combined with 100% face mask use, disease spread is vastly diminished, preventing resurgence for 18 months, the time frame that has frequently been cited for developing a vaccine.

> My girlfriend went to a party last night in Florida with no masks & an open buffet.       Apparently, she trusts all the party goers are following recommendations, while not following recommendations.     I don't have anything else to add, I just had to tell SOMEONE  because I'm embarrassed to share this with anyone I know

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/cdc-may-reimplement-strict-coronavirus-rules-if-cases-go-up-dramatically.html):

> States may need to reimplement the strict social distancing measures that were put in place earlier this year if U.S. coronavirus cases rise "Dramatically," a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said Friday. Covid-19 has sickened more than 2 million Americans and killed at least 113,820 since the first confirmed U.S. case less than five months ago, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Of the 2,402 people who completed the surveys, 74.3% reported they would feel unsafe if U.S. restrictions were lifted, compared with 81.5% in New York City and 73.4% in Los Angeles, according to the CDC. New York City and Los Angeles have seen some of the largest outbreaks in the U.S. CDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters Friday that it continues to be "Extremely important" that Americans embrace recommendations such as hand washing and wearing a face covering when in public.

> That is not going to happen. I feel like a lot of states are going to continue with reopening on the basis that shutting down will only hurt the economy even more. Then you have people who are not going to listen to any more restrictions after being home for two months.   It is going to be a mess.
