> France is also testing dramatically more than they were in the previous "wave" of the outbreak.  Back when France was getting pummeled in late March through April, they were doing ~10,000 tests per day with a ~15-20% positive rate.
> 
> Lately, France is doing 150,000-200,000 tests per day with a ~5-8% positive rate.
> 
> In all likelihood the scope of the outbreak was much larger back in March/April, there just wasn't enough testing to demonstrate it.  The mortality and hospitalization rates show that pretty clearly.  The prior "peak" was at the tail end of March and beginning of April, averaging about 4,500 cases per day ... and then by mid-April France was averaging some 900 deaths per day.  New cases reached 4,500+ per day again around August 28^th, and now they are averaging ~30 deaths per day.
> 
> Of course, this new "wave" of the outbreak is also probably largely circulating among younger people with schools open again.

## White House abandoned plan to send 650 million face masks across the U.S. in April, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/white-house-abandoned-plan-to-deliver-650-million-face-masks-across-us-report-says.html):

> The U.S. Postal Service had drafted a press release announcing plans to send 650 million masks out across the U.S. early in the coronavirus crisis, but the White House ultimately abandoned the plan, The Washington Post reported Thursday. The plan would have sent a pack of five reusable masks to every residential address in the country, the Post reported, citing one of thousands of internal post office documents obtained by watchdog group American Oversight. An HHS spokesperson told the Post around 600 million masks have been distributed out of the 650 million set aside.
