> Obligatory sticky: I am not qualified to give medical advice. I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

New vaccination numbers from the Centers for Disease Control show approximately 52% of the state's eligible population have been fully vaccinated. State InterAgency Task Force Director Jim Hoyer also urged more younger residents Tuesday to agree to be vaccinated.

## Pfizer says COVID vaccine is highly effective against Delta variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-says-covid-vaccine-highly-effective-against-delta-variant-2021-06-24/):

> JERUSALEM, June 24 - The Pfizer-BioNTech >PFE.N< vaccine is highly effective against the Delta variant of COVID-19, a Pfizer official in Israel said on Thursday. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, said that Israel still lacks enough data to provide insight into vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant. An analysis by Public Health England, where the Delta variant is more widespread, found that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines provide more than 90% protection against hospitalization from the Delta variant.

## Surgeon General warns misinformation is the greatest threat to COVID-19 vaccination efforts

Summary of [original article](https://whdh.com/news/surgeon-general-warns-misinformation-is-the-greatest-threat-to-covid-19-vaccination-efforts/):

> Experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have estimated that 70 to 85% of people in the US will need to become immune to the virus through vaccination or infection in order to control community spread. But after initial surges, vaccination rates have slowed, and only 53.7% of the population has received at least one dose. "The difference between last year and this we have traditional business back we didn't have last year during the initial surge. The demand for beds is higher for both Covid and non-Covid patients. It's definitely a stretch." Two continued to have an abnormal sense of smell a year later - one who couldn't smell much and another who had an abnormal smell sense.
