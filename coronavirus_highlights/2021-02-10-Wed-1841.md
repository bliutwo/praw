> Wait wtf. Did I miss this?

> Edit: i checked around CDC and academic sites. There’s no other mention of it lasting only three months. Just that we don’t know yet. Seems that guesses are for at least a year. This is very poor reporting on CNN’s part.

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-vaccines-cut-infection-rates-after-the-first-jab-by-up-to-two-thirds-study-12214514):

> Vaccines cut infection rates after the first jab by up to two-thirds, according to a British study likely to put pressure on Boris Johnson to lift lockdown faster. Early results of the vast UK study on the impact of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout suggests that the level of protection was about 60% to 65%. The results applied to vaccine recipients of all ages, and protection began after two weeks. WHO scientists issued interim recommendations on the vaccine, saying that the jab could be given to people aged 18 and above "Without an upper age limit".

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/2021/02/ohio-health-department-says-it-underreported-coronavirus-deaths-by-about-4000.html):

> CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Ohio Department of Health announced late Wednesday that as many as 4,000 COVID-19 deaths may have gone unreported by the agency, and said it planned to make the adjustments in the coming week. The state to date has reported 11,856 deaths since the onset of coronavirus in Ohio early last year. The health department statement said: "ODH will continue working with the auditor of state's office, which has been engaged in an audit of COVID-19 data since September of 2020. The issue related to the unreconciled COVID-19 deaths was identified by the Ohio Department of Health during a routine employee training."

> Unpossible.  My high school friend on Facebook said the Covid numbers were all massively inflated due to some vague payment conspiracy.

## US COVID-19 deaths decline as hospitalization, cases drop

Summary of [original article](https://www.reportdoor.com/us-covid-19-deaths-decline-as-hospitalization-cases-drop/):

> The seven-day average for daily COVID-19 deaths in the US has plummeted by more than 15 percent over the last two weeks, data shows. The latest count showed there was an average of 2,787 deaths each day in the week ending on Tuesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. "The trend in reported COVID-19 deaths is improving in every major US region," the group wrote on Twitter.

`/u/IanMazgelis` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lh1u5s/us_covid19_deaths_decline_as_hospitalization/):

> At this point I think the question is when the drop is going to level off. And to be more particular, if the drop will level off at a point where it will be irresponsible to continue easing restrictions. I can honestly say I have no idea.
> 
> I do think we're going to start to see states ease restrictions throughout March, and maybe we'll see more states even drop the mask mandate. I expect it to be incredibly controversial, but I still expect it.
