## Conservative think tank leader says schools should reopen since most Texans dying from COVID-19 are elderly or Hispanic

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/28/vance-ginn-texas-coronavirus/):

> Vance Ginn, the chief economist for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, is facing fierce backlash for a recent racist tweet that said schools should open since most of the people dying from the coronavirus in Texas are elderly or Hispanic. The state's racial and ethnic breakdown of deaths had large gaps, with up to 18% of deaths last month recorded as "Unknown." A revised count of the data released Monday by the Department of State Health Services shows that Hispanic Texans are overrepresented in the state's updated fatality count. Disclosure: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-women-gender-covid19-america-us-symptoms-havent-gone-away-anxiety-a9643041.html):

> Women who have been suffering from prolonged coronavirus symptoms have hit back at doctors who they say fail to recognise their suffering and dismiss it as a psychological condition or stress.

Dr Jessica Dine, director of the advanced consultative pulmonary section at Penn Medicine and a pulmonologist who has been treating patients with persistent symptoms, told NBC News that "The first step is to recognise that these symptoms are real".

> My brother had covid 5 months ago. He was a "mild" case but is still suffering hard. Any activity and he gets exhausted immediately. And chest pains. So far the doctors have found nothing unusual. Still awaiting results from a cardiologist now. 
> 
> In the Netherlands there are government doctors that give advice to the workplace. His advice currently is that he should reduce stress and start working little bits. Because he has a burn-out... This is absolutely not the case, but he's just going with it. Since starting to work a few hours a day is what he wanted and all he can do for the time being.
