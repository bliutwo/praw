## With No End in Sight to the Coronavirus, Some Teachers Are Retiring Rather Than Go Back to School

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5864158/coronavirus-teachers-school/):

> About 20% of teachers said they aren't likely to return to teaching if schools reopen in the fall, according to a USA Today/Ipsos poll conducted in late May. EdWeek Research Center surveys conducted around the same time found that more than 10% of teachers are more likely to leave the profession now than they were before the pandemic, and 65% of educators said they want school buildings to remain closed to slow the spread of the virus. In Connecticut-where a union survey found that 43% of teachers think they're at higher risk for severe illness if they contract COVID-19 because of their age or an underlying medical condition-Andrea Cohen, who is over 65, decided to retire as an elementary school social worker. In the middle of an economic crisis that has left millions unemployed, including public school employees, many teachers aren't looking to flee the profession, despite their concerns about this fall.

> "Our churches have followed protocols - masks, go in one door and out the other, social distancing," said Cynthia Fierro Harvey, a bishop with the United Methodist Church in Louisiana, where three churches closed again over the last week. There were just six recorded cases of the coronavirus in Union County, in rural northeastern Oregon, when the Lighthouse United Pentecostal Church announced its reopening on May 22 in an Instagram post that also cited Mr. Trump's remarks about reopening churches. The church's pastor, Dustin Zarick, said in a video posted to Facebook that the church had canceled all youth activities because "Several families had been affected by Covid-19." He said the church had made the "Proactive decision" in order to keep members safe.

## Top Pediatrician Says States Shouldn't Force Schools To Reopen If Virus Is Surging

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/08/888853601/school-reopenings-should-keep-public-health-in-mind-pediatric-group-says?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=national):

> Doctor Pushes Back On Trump's Coronavirus School Reopening Efforts : Coronavirus Live Updates The American Academy of Pediatrics says children are better off in school but that the decision to reopen cannot ignore spiking infection rates. President Trump issued a forceful call this week for America's K-12 schools to reopen full time for all children in the fall, suggesting that Democrats want to keep schools closed ahead of the November election and even threatening to cut off federal funding to schools if they don't fully reopen. So all decisions really have to be made with public health and the school officials looking at that as part of their decision-making on whether they can reopen safely.

Canada - with a population one-tenth the size of the United States - has so far recorded 8,711 deaths and 106,167 cases and Trudeau said the situation was stabilizing, although some hot spots remained. Canada and the United States have blocked nonessential travel between the two nations since March and are discussing whether to extend the ban when it expires on July 21.
