## Teacher creates national database of COVID-19-related school closings, cases and deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/education/2020/08/15/dedicated-educator-creates-budding-national-database-coronavirus-related-school-closings-cases-and-d/5591124002/):

> A dedicated educator's local project, initiated out of anticipation of the upcoming academic year, has grown into a national database that tracks coronavirus-related school closings, cases and deaths. Alisha Morris, who teaches theater in Kansas' Olathe School District, was scouring the internet for news reports about COVID-19 issues surrounding K-12 school re-openings across the country when she became overwhelmed with information. Morris said she discovered more than 2,000 students, faculty, administrators and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide since the beginning of last month, with the cases being traced to myriad events including in-person schooling, staff meetings, extracurricular activities, summer camps, extended school year programs, graduation ceremonies and others.

> It's incredible to me that states/governments aren't collecting this information. It's so important that people can make informed decisions about opening schools and the impacts of various mitagation measures. 
> 
> I'm not only talking about the US here, I live in the UK and I would be very surprised if my government made this sort of information available to school and local authorities, let alone the general public. If you had asked me 6 months ago I would have simply assumed that governments would collect and share this as a matter of good public health policy, but 2020 has shaken any vestiges of faith i may have have had that politicians have the peoples interests at heart.

## Children are very contagious, should wear masks to school to prevent COVID spread: Swedish researchers

Summary of [original article](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2020/aug/16/children-are-very-contagious-should-wear-masks-to-school-to-prevent-covid-spread-13899.html):

> A group of 26 Swedish researchers suggested that children should wear face masks in schools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it was reported. According to the researchers, there is now data from South Korea, the US and Israel that proves that the children are contagious - and data from Sweden that proves that the children can become seriously ill. On its website, the Swedish Public Health Agency, which offers national guidance for the pandemic, writes that the current state of knowledge shows that few children and young people are infected with Covid-19 - and that school activities have not been shown to be a driving force in the spread of infection.

## Quarter of a million cancer referrals missed due to Covid, says report

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/16/quarter-million-cancer-referrals-missed-due-covid-says-report/):

> More than a quarter of a million urgent cancer referrals were missed due to coronavirus, a new report suggests, which predicts a drop in survival chances. GPs made 339,242 urgent cancer referrals in England between April and June, down from 594,060 in the same period last year. Just before lockdown was introduced on March 23 the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, which decides what services the NHS must offer, advised cancer patients, many of whom have compromised immune systems, to balance the risk of delaying treatment with that of catching Covid whilst in hospital.

`/u/kavieng` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ib1gue/quarter_of_a_million_cancer_referrals_missed_due/):

> With less people being screened for cancer due to covid related factors such as a shift in focus of the healthcare system, fear and lockdowns means that cancer is less likely to be picked up at crucial periods which would increase survivability, unfortunately. Whereas last year around 600,000 referrals were made between April and June, this year the number has been less than 340,000, around a quarter of a million less. Moreover, treatment as well may be delayed, with resources directed toward the pandemic, and cancer research losing much funding.
> 
> The report was put together by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), with the associate director, Harry Quilter-Pinner claiming that “Our analysis shows that thousands could die early of conditions such as cancer as a result of the lockdown.”
> 
> EDIT: This **isn’t** worldwide numbers, just the UK or England. The worldwide number would be alarming.
