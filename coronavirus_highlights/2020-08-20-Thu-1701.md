## Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Jump to Over 1.1 Million: Live Updates

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/08/20/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus):

> Mr. Leske, 52, said that work began to dry up in March and that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program - which covers independent contractors, self-employed workers and others who don't qualify for regular state benefits - had been crucial to keeping him afloat, especially with the $600 weekly federal supplement that expired at the end of last month. Only people who already qualify to receive at least $100 in unemployment benefits each week are eligible for the federal funds, which are retroactive to Aug. 1.The program gives states the option to contribute $100 in additional funds, increasing the weekly benefit to $400. But some states are nervous about chipping in, citing severe budget shortfalls. Congress sweetened the program's appeal during the pandemic, promising as part of the CARES Act that the federal government would pick up the cost from the states through the end of the year, without an overall cap, but nearly half of all states still don't have such a program.

`/u/evil420pimp` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/id9j3c/jobless_claims_unexpectedly_jump_to_over_11/):

> Unexpectedly?
> 
> Sorry, but has anything actually happened? Has anything changed? Where is this magical place that jobs are supposedly being created? Has the government done anything in months? Has the virus gone away or changed?
> 
> No. Nothing has changed. These numbers are useless. I've been unemployed for about 5 months now, and we're no closer to opening many parts of society. This is reality for another 6-12 months. When you've still left 10% of previous jobs virtually illegal, and nobody is creating new ones, *thinking anything is going to change is total foolishness*.
> 
> But it's cool, let's keep changing the narrative based on nothing.
