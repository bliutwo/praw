> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

## Fauci says he will take new Pfizer vaccine if FDA approves it

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fauci-idUSKBN27Q2SU):

> 1 Min Read.WASHINGTON - U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he will take Pfizer Inc's new coronavirus vaccine if the Food and Drug Administration approves it and that he has confidence in the company and the government agency. Asked on MSNBC if he would take the vaccine, Fauci said: "I'm going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer. I trust the FDA. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists. If they look at this data, and they say this data is solid, let's go ahead and approve it, I promise you, I will take the vaccine, and I will recommend that my family take the vaccine."

> This is the best-case scenario.  Get Fauci, Trump/Pence/Biden/Harris/whatever, Redfield, Pelosi, McConnell, etc. to verifiably receive the vaccine as a vote of confidence.  That would be the way to get the largest number of Americans to buy into it.

## ‘We’re being left behind’: Rural hospitals can’t afford ultra-cold freezers to store the leading Covid-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/11/rural-hospitals-cant-afford-freezers-to-store-pfizer-covid19-vaccine/):

> Large urban hospitals across the U.S. are rushing to buy expensive ultra-cold freezers to store what's likely to be the first approved Covid-19 vaccine. Asked about the challenges of distributing the vaccine to rural areas, a Pfizer spokesperson said the company "Is committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to have access to our vaccine working closely with local government." Pfizer is practiced at distributing and storing the vaccine as part of its Phase 3 clinical trial, the spokesperson added. Not only do they help with Pfizer's shot, but ultra-cold freezers are also an asset for distributing Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which must be stored at -20 C. Though many medical and pharmaceutical freezers get that cold, an ultra-cold freezer will expand the availability of cold storage for those that don't have access to one.
