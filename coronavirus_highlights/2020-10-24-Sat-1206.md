> Honestly I think a national mask mandate would change very little. It might increase mask usage slightly (maybe it’s worth doing even just for that) but it would require an unprecedented degree of enforcement to get enough people to comply, and that’s almost impossible when so many authorities themselves are anti-mask or apathetic. My state has had a mask mandate since April and not only do tons of people simply ignore it, authorities do not consistently enforce it. I’ve seen large groups of teens just casually emerge from McDonalds with only like a quarter wearing masks. There are complaints in my area of staff at *doctor’s offices* not wearing masks. legitimately idk what to do.

## 'Mom code': Parents reportedly avoid testing kids to keep Utah COVID-19 numbers artificially low

> SALT LAKE CITY - Some parents in Utah have reportedly created a "Mom code," an unwritten agreement to avoid testing their children for COVID-19 in an effort to keep schools open. Some of the posts read: "Stay home, don't get tested!" and "If your child shows COVID symptoms please keep them home but do not test." "Frequent testing can actually start to contain outbreaks and move to opening more schools and keeping them open."

## Belgium cancels non-urgent surgery as full COVID lockdown looms.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/23/belgium-cancels-non-urgent-surgery-as-full-covid-lockdown-looms):

> Belgium has inched closer to a second national lockdown with new "Harsh measures" as all non-urgent surgeries were suspended for a month from Monday to give hospitals breathing space in the face of spiralling coronavirus infection rates. In a notable moment in the country's crisis, Belgium's prime minister said he believed it was still within the power of the Belgian people to avoid a second full national lockdown involving the shutting of schools and non-essential shops. The average number of daily infections in Belgium between 13 and 19 October was 10,454, an increase of 69% on the previous week.

> I wonder when next person brings up the Ioannidis study to tell us all, that the c/ifr is actually very low and we don't have to worry. Full ICU's tell us the opposite.
> Thank god. Someone has to tell the doctors and nurses that the situation is completely normal. Maybe they forgot about a room or two with empty beds left in their hospital.

## Despite restaurant reopenings, indoor dining is still a big COVID risk

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnet.com/health/is-it-safe-to-eat-at-indoor-restaurants-during-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know/):

> "Several risk factors are coming together with indoor dining: being indoors, prolonged conversations and frequent mask removal. Until someone invents a mask that you can eat in, while still capturing respiratory droplets, that risk remains." Even if you're dining with people you live with, you will also likely come into contact with others outside your household during the dining experience. "Specific spreading events have been linked to indoor dining, so viral transmission with indoor dining is likely contributing to cases, to some degree. In addition, people who dine indoors at restaurants may also be less risk-averse in their behavior beyond restaurants, compared to people who are avoiding indoor restaurant dining entirely right now," Dr. Liu says.

> The most enormous mistake that has been made in this pandemic (in most countries, not just the US) was the decision to put customers and employees on one side against businesses on the other by forcing everyone to make a choice between normal life and lockdown or earning a living vs. lockdown. There are alternatives. Sometimes you pay a business to stay closed for a while. Sometimes you pay people to stay home. You have to be creative and forget about the way things have always been done, not just for a little while but for as long as it takes. Communities in situations like this need to make sure everyone shares the sacrifices that need to be made for everyone's sake and to determine how to target the sacrifices intelligently so that they are not a blunt instrument. The way communities get this done, unfortunately for anyone who doesn't want to accept this reality, is government. You can see very starkly the contrast between outcomes in societies where this sense of community exists- Asia, and where it doesn't- mostly European and American countries. This pandemic is a preview for how a lot of other similar crises are going to play out and its nothing less than natural selection in action. "Natural selection" is a pretty sterile term that belies its meaning: lots and lots of people dying, and their way of life dying along with them.
