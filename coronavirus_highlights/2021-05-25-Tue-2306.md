## Soldier who called on troops to refuse vaccine distribution faces mutiny related charge

Summary of [original article](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/soldier-who-called-on-troops-to-refuse-vaccine-distribution-faces-mutiny-related-charge/):

> A soldier who called on his fellow military personnel to refuse helping with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been charged with an offence related to mutiny. Kenderesi, who had a civilian hunting knife strapped to his Canadian Forces uniform and was carrying a non-Canadian helmet, questioned the safety of the vaccine. Ottawa lawyer Michel Drapeau said the laying of a charge related to mutiny is unheard of in the Canadian Forces in modern times.

## Why it’s time to stop wiping down groceries and other COVID-19 cleaning measures that don’t reduce transmission risk

Summary of [original article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-should-we-stop-wiping-down-the-groceries-its-time-to-cut-covid-19/):

> Experts say that it's time to move past "Hygiene theatre" - or cleaning behaviours that give people a sense of security and protection, but are actually unlikely to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission. The environmental impact of disposable wipes, the cost of disinfecting supplies, and the burden on restaurant and retail employees to maintain strict COVID-19 cleaning measures, are further reasons to start being pragmatic - and stop wiping down groceries and mail. Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said that in public spaces and community settings outside of households, the risk of surface transmission is relatively low and can "Easily be addressed through conventional cleaning - without deep cleaning, deep disinfection, and [by using] hand disinfectant."

> I know the article is about groceries but wiping down gym equipment has always been common practice. As a pre-covid gym user I hope people don't forget that
