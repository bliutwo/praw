> I think people aren’t caring anymore, 1. Becuase they think just because the vaccine is here everything it solved, or 2. People keep hearing that even if you get a vaccine, nothing changes for you. You still wear a mask anywhere you go and still have to social distance. I know this is exactly why my own dad won’t get it. It’s tough. I know the reasoning behind keeping the precautions going even when vaccinated, but it has to be frustrating for certain people who feel like there’s no point in a vaccination if it doesn’t change anything.

## Partnership with Black churches increases COVID-19 vaccine delivery among historically at-risk population

Summary of [original article](https://news.llu.edu/research/partnership-with-black-churches-increases-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-among-historically-risk-population):

> Incorporating Black churches and clergy in COVID-19 vaccination education and distribution has been found to be an effective model in helping to increase vaccination delivery to historically at-risk populations in San Bernardino County, a study says. The study, A three-tiered approach to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccine delivery in the Black community, illustrates a method of partnership among Black faith leaders, public health officials, and Black medical professionals that has led to more COVID-19 vaccinations in the Black community. In the United States, particularly in California, the delivery of COVID-19 vaccinations to Black individuals continues to lag significantly behind that of their non-Hispanic white counterparts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and COVID-19 death rates among Black, Hispanic and Native Americans are three times higher than the rate of white Americans.

> I live in Baltimore. The hood does not care about covid restrictions at all. That in addition to the skyhigh rates of obesity means higher mortality.

## Covid: 'Young medics have seen more deaths than some do in a career'

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-56286593):

> "For young nurses and doctors, who let's say have graduated last year, they come into the job and have seen so much sickness and people dying in front of their eyes. It can be psychologically traumatising. I have seen staff members cry in silence because they have seen so much death." "If you spent a year of your training as a doctor looking after Covid patients and not looking after your relevant speciality, you miss that period. So people are going to have to gain a lot of experience very quickly in the normal stuff and non-Covid stuff." Patients were initially being transferred by people wearing hazmat suits, Dervla recalls.

`/u/Natoochtoniket` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mb6f7c/covid_young_medics_have_seen_more_deaths_than/):

> We will have to provide PTSD treatment for a lot of people, for a long time.     Counseling and/or support groups will be needed for a lot of people -- not just ICU workers.   There has been lots of trauma in the last year, and it is still ongoing.
