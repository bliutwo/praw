Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/):

> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

## Elvis Presley Received a Polio Vaccination on Live TV — Here's Why Public Vaccinations Matter

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/health/elvis-presley-polio-vaccination-live-tv-why-public-vaccinations-key/):

> After the singer received the polio vaccine on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956, many young people chose to get immunized. During a period when polio plagued the country, he received a polio vaccine on live TV on The Ed Sullivan Show. While most children were getting vaccinated at that time, many teens and young adults didn't think they were at risk from polio and were reluctant to get the vaccine.

## Doctor’s licence is suspended over dismissal of Covid as a ‘common cold’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/oregon-doctor-licence-suspended-coronavirus-b1766782.html):

> An Oregon doctor who was against wearing masks had his medical licence revoked after his public refusal to acknowledge the coronavirus as anything more than the "Common cold". Dr LaTulippe reportedly told the patient that asymptomatic people should not get a test or wear a mask as there was little proof it would prevent transmission of the novel virus. The medical board also found the staff at Dr LaTulippe's clinic refused to wear masks and also encouraged patients to remove their masks.

`/u/banditta82` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k7c8b1/doctors_licence_is_suspended_over_dismissal_of/):

> I wonder how many other required medical practices he has refused to follow over the years do to not liking them and just never got caught.

## Oregon doctor’s license revoked over refusal to wear mask during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-doctor-s-license-revoked-over-refusal-wear-mask-during-n1250092):

> The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a "Common cold." The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.

`/u/shinygingerprincess` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k76rig/oregon_doctors_license_revoked_over_refusal_to/):

> Good. We need to see real consequences for this bullshit.
