## Study: Temperature checks, symptom screenings not very effective in detecting COVID-19 infections

Summary of [original article](https://abc13.com/temperature-checks-covid-coronavirus-symptoms-screenings/7922615/):

> A study of Marine recruits found that despite these measures and strict quarantines before they started training, the recruits spread the virus to others even though hardly any of them had symptoms. None of the infections were caught through symptom screening. Another 35 - an additional 2% - tested positive during the two-week military quarantine and only four had symptoms.

In the city, 335 people have died as of Thursday afternoon and about 35,300 have tested positive since March 1.Against that backdrop, a city proposal to increase the penalty for violations of Health Department orders from $500 to between $500 to $5,000 was unanimously approved by the city's Public Safety and Health Committee Thursday. The Journal Sentinel reported last month that Milwaukee health officials were overwhelmed and struggling to reach people who tested positive for the virus and their close contacts.

## It’s Time to Hunker Down | A devastating surge is here. Unless Americans act aggressively, it will get much larger, very quickly.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/lock-yourself-down-now/617106/):

> If fewer people can be admitted to hospitals because of lack of space, patients won't benefit from our improved clinical management of COVID-19. We may also see deaths rise from other causes: Fewer nonurgent but important surgeries, more overworked medical staff, and overburdened emergency rooms could all contribute to worsening health outcomes for many other viruses that peak in winter months, like influenza, as well other ordinary medical conditions. Only a few weeks later, we are already at about 1 million cases a week, with no sign of slowing down.
