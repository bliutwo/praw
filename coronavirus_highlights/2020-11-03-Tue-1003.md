## More Americans approve of Fauci's handling of coronavirus than POTUS, new poll finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/2020-election-polls-voters-approve-more-of-fauci-than-trump-on-coronavirus.html):

> Trump's presidential election rival, Democrat Joe Biden, aimed to leverage Fauci's popularity during his final string of campaign stops. "I've got a better idea: Let's keep Dr. Fauci on the job and fire Donald Trump," he said. Trump could face difficulties in trying to directly fire Fauci, a civil servant whose career has spanned decades.

`/u/grimace24` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jn0w4e/more_americans_approve_of_faucis_handling_of/):

> This is the reason Trump can't stand Fauci. Fauci is more trusted and more liked than the president. In Trump's eyes Fauci is up staging him and you can't do that to him.
> 
> Fauci is knowledgeable and tells it like it is. He isn't sugarcoating it or lying thought his teeth.

## Charlie Baker orders people to wear masks in public, no matter how far they are from other people

Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/02/nation/charlie-baker-orders-people-wear-masks-public-no-matter-how-far-they-are-other-people):

> The order applies to both indoor and outdoor public places. Like the previous order, which went into effect on May 6, it covers, among other things, grocery stores, pharmacies, and retail stores; public transportation, taxis, livery, and ridesharing vehicles. "We're basically saying, 'If you go out in public, wear a mask,'" Baker said.

`/u/_MentosTheFreshmaker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jmxugj/charlie_baker_orders_people_to_wear_masks_in/):

> > “The new order requires everyone above the age of 5 to wear a face covering in public. We’re making this clear for everyone. No more exceptions —and no exemptions for when you can maintain social distance,” Baker said at a State House news conference.
> 
> > “It’s our hope that this simpler, more straightforward rule becomes easier for the public to follow and easier for local officials to enforce this mandatory order this way,” he said.
> 
> Well, it *is* a lot easier to enforce now.

## Up to 15 Percent of LA’s COVID-19 Cases Come From Dining at Restaurants

Summary of [original article](https://la.eater.com/2020/10/29/21536567/morning-briefing-restaurant-news-los-angeles-dr-ferrer-coronavirus-cases-10-percent-dining-out):

> Dr. Ferrer said that "Particularly indoors it becomes easier for this virus to spread." Currently only outdoor sit-down dining is allowed at restaurants in Los Angeles County, though state officials could soon grant the county the ability to move a reduced percentage of diners indoors after meeting several health metrics, if it so chooses. Already neighboring counties Orange and Ventura have allowed indoor dining at a reduced capacity. Riverside County had granted indoor dining at 25 percent capacity but was then forced to close it off due to an upstick in COVID-19 cases.

`/u/sunflower53069` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jnbasu/up_to_15_percent_of_las_covid19_cases_come_from/):

> Another big percentage from churches. Anywhere indoors with lots of people will spread it.
