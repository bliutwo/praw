## Vaccine FAQ: Variants, Chronic Conditions, NSAIDs, and more

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids/):

> Due to the more limited supply of the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech worldwide, the Moderna vaccine has not had as many large, nationwide studies specifically aimed at determining efficacy of the vaccine for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, though it is highly likely that given their highly similar mechanisms of action, properties found of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely hold for the Moderna vaccine. Per the CDC guidelines, the only absolute contraindications to vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine are a known and documented history of severe and/or immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or a component of the vaccine. Though not all regulatory bodies or jurisdictions have made firm indications, the US FDA has indicated that minor updates to approved vaccines to cover future variants of SARS-CoV-2 would not need to undergo a separate three-phase trial; rather, an expedited immunogenicity trial can be conducted to verify that the vaccine produces an immune response against the variant of the virus, and the vaccine could be quickly authorized and distributed as an amendment to the previous authorization or approval.

> This surprised me but I had an interaction at work a couple days ago re this. Asked someone if he'd gotten it yet and I said "nah, I can't afford that shit." Told him it was free and he was legit surprised. Couldn't believe he hadn't heard that, but then I guess you can't underestimate how many people just aren't exposed to the news or other channels of information.

Summary of [original article](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-04-14-tv-2-erfarer-astrazeneca-vaccine-droppes-helt):

> Vaccinen fra AstraZeneca droppes nu helt i Danmark og er skrevet ud af det samlede vaccinationsprogram. Han understreger samtidig, at det ikke alene sammenhængen mellem vaccine og bivirkninger, der gør, at AstraZeneca-vaccinen droppes. Det har den, mens undersøgelser om en mulig sammenhæng mellem vaccinen og sjældne, men alvorlige blodpropper har stået på. Det Europæiske Lægemiddelagentur fortsatte længe med at anbefale brugen af AstraZeneca på trods af, at flere lande i Europa satte vaccinen på pause.

## Denver moving to 100% capacity for restaurants, gyms, with social distancing still enforced

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-moving-to-100-capacity-for-restaurants-gyms-with-social-distancing-still-enforced):

> DENVER - Colorado's largest county will also move to 100% capacity levels for restaurants on Friday, Denver officials announced on Wednesday, pointing to a lower mortality rate with more residents getting vaccinated. Denver on Friday will move to "Level Blue," which allows restaurants and gyms to operate at 100% capacity, though six-foot social distancing will still be in place, limiting capacity somewhat. While case counts in Denver and across Colorado have ticked up in recent weeks, Denver has reported five COVID-19 deaths since March 28.

> I don't see how social distancing is going to be enforced if you go back to 100% capacity. The genie is out of the bottle at 100%.

## COVID Hospitalizations Cut In Half Among Older New Yorkers Thanks To Vaccines

Summary of [original article](https://gothamist.com/news/covid-hospitalizations-cut-half-among-older-new-yorkers-thanks-vaccines):

> New York City is beginning to see the "Real world" effect of COVID-19 vaccines. The drop is nearly twice the reduction in hospitalizations among New Yorkers younger than 65, which has decreased by 29%. Chokshi pointed to COVID-19 vaccines, which were prioritized for older people through senior center programs and age requirements to reach the most vulnerable in the early days of the vaccine rollout. "The vaccines are life-saving, and here in New York City, we are starting to see them have the real world benefit that has been observed in Israel, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere," Chokshi said during a press briefing on Wednesday.
