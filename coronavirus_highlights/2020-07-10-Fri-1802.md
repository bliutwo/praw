Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/10/eminem-criticises-non-mask-wearers-on-new-rap-track-kid-cudi-covid-19):

> Eminem has entered the debate about face masks in a collaboration with Kid Cudi, tackling an issue that is the subject of fierce disagreement in the US and UK. The single, The Adventures of Moon Man and Slim Shady, is the first time the two rappers have joined forces. The president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said on Monday that refusing to wear a mask in indoor public settings should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt. The collaboration between Eminem and Kid Cudi was announced on Twitter on Wednesday by Kid Cudi's daughter, Vada.

## Fauci: “I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately”

> The president flouts his advice - refusing to wear a mask and holding rallies - and, Fauci tells me, hasn't even met him for more than a month. Fauci may have developed a fan base that is snapping up Fauci T-shirts, mugs and bobblehead dolls - but he has also been disparaged and even received death threats from people who believe coronavirus is a con. Fauci has a fine line to tread. In an interview with Science magazine in March, he said that when Trump makes a mistake, he prefers to get Trump's advisers to correct him for next time.

> Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd died June 26 after testing positive for COVID-19.She taught first grade in the Hayden-Winkelman Unified School District in a small eastern Arizona community. Before she tested positive, Byrd and two other teachers taught a summer school class virtually from the same classroom. The teachers who survived also say Byrd's death is a stark reminder of the risks teachers will face if school reopens too soon.

> I am a third grade teacher in Texas - I love my job and love my students.  This will be my tenth year in public education, all my experience in title 1 schools because I want to be where I can make a difference.  I made the mistake of posting about my worries for my health (cancer survivor with compromised immune system) and was shocked at the hate that spewed all over me.  I spend about half my salary and 80 hours a week in my classroom.  I feel like also sacrificing my life is just too much to ask of me.  I was told to “just quit” and others told me if I don’t like it I can “just get out.”  I am saddened by the state of our country.

## ‘All the hospitals are full’: In Houston, overwhelmed ICUs leave COVID-19 patients waiting in ER

> In a statement, HCA spokeswoman Debra Burbridge said hospital officials have taken steps to reduce the impact on patients, including sending staff members who would normally be performing or assisting with elective surgeries - which have been suspended under an order by the governor - to treat patients with COVID-19.Dr. Kusum Mathews, an assistant professor of critical care and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said hospitals can take steps to reduce the risks of overcrowded ERs, including some of those described by Memorial Hermann and HCA officials. "Those things are not like a switch-key type of activity," said Porsa, the Harris Health System CEO, noting that his hospitals have had to send patients to hospitals outside of Houston to make room. With most Texas businesses still open and no mandatory stay-at-home order, hospitals in Houston and other COVID-19 hot spots face the added challenge of making room for COVID patients while still dealing with a steady flow of patients seeking care for other medical emergencies.

> By the time Governors get the courage to act it will be far too late. The worst weeks of this virus are always going to be the weeks after we lock down- that means a lockdown today will still have 3 weeks of increasing hospitalizations with no hospital beds. 
> 
> The governors who are deferring to the interests of the corporate class now are going to be very surprised when the corporate class does not come to their aid when the citizens come knocking.
