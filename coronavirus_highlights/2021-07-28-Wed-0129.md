## Experts back CDC change on masks as delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/experts-back-cdc-change-masks-delta-variant-spreads-rcna1526):

> The change was met with relief from experts who said masking up again is essential to combat the highly contagious delta variant. The change in guidance was driven by the delta variant's higher transmissibility and new evidence from the CDC that in rare cases, fully vaccinated individuals who get infected with the variant can spread the virus just as easily as unvaccinated people. Some experts have been critical of the CDC, saying the agency was premature in lifting its mask mandate for fully vaccinated people in May. Mokdad has been vocal on Twitter, saying the agency needed to reimpose its masking guidance earlier, particularly before the delta variant became the predominant strain circulating in the country.

> I think Italy is on the right track.   Making vaccinations mandatory for certain activities essentially gives more  freedoms to the vaccinated.   
> The unvaccinated are the ones who have been accusing the rest of us of "hiding at home in fear"..........let's see how they feel when the shoe is on the other foot!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/washington-post-mandate-covid-19-vaccinations-reporters-staff-2021-07-27/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=twitter):

> July 27 - All Washington Post employees will be required to present proof of full COVID-19 vaccination by mid-September as a condition of employment, with exceptions for medical and religious concerns, Publisher Fred Ryan announced on Tuesday in a memo to staff. The newspaper, owned by billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos, plans to reopen its offices for all employees for three days per week on Sept. 13, and employees must show vaccination proof by then, Ryan said. "Even though the overwhelming majority of Post employees have already provided proof of vaccination, I do not take this decision lightly," Ryan said in the memo.
