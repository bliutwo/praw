## 80 Percent Of LA County Restaurants And Bars Are Not Following Coronavirus Guidelines

Summary of [original article](https://laist.com/latest/post/20200627/80-percent-of-LA-restaurants-not-following-coronavirus-guidelines):

> Today in disturbing news: most restaurants and bars in Los Angeles County are not following COVID-19 precautions, according to the Public Health Department. On June 15, the county found that half of restaurants inspected since reopening weren't in compliance with new guidelines. Maybe if the Public Health Department had given restaurants more advanced notice to prepare for reopening ... or didn't rely on the honor system for safety precautions, this could have been avoided.

## Risk of never fully recovering after coronavirus ‘very real,’ scientists say

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7111094/coronavirus-scientists-health-problems/):

> Scientists are only starting to grasp the vast array of health problems caused by the novel coronavirus, some of which may have lingering effects on patients and health systems for years to come, according to doctors and infectious disease experts. While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization, but are still suffering months after first becoming infected. Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine, reviewed current scientific literature and found about half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had neurological complications, such as dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness and muscle pain.

> This is a hugely important point. Imbeciles are still doing their damnedest to minimize and downplay the severity of the situation: it's not a live/die deal. Viral infections can have serious consequences decades down the road, look at Viral Parkinsonism and all the viruses that produce similar symptoms.

> You don't want this virus, no matter how small and insignificant you think the mortality rate is.

## COVID-19 has not surged in cities with big protests, but it has in states that reopened early. Here are some possible reasons.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-no-spike-cities-despite-protests-big-surge-in-states-that-reopened-20200627.html):

> Those "Other things" are the main driver of the renewed outbreaks in states including Arizona, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi and Florida - states that had largely reopened. While expanded testing accounts for some of the soaring case numbers, the proportion of positive tests suggests increased transmission. In Arizona, 23% of tests over the last week came back positive.

> Contradicting this conclusion, a California state health official stated that protests were a contributing factor to that state’s coronavirus surge: [The link is here. ](https://deadline.com/2020/06/california-coronavirus-200000-cases-flood-of-new-infections-1202971077/amp/)

> “Asked about the protests in Friday’s news conference, a state health official responded, “We do know from speaking with our counties that it is a contributor. We will not be able to distinguish exactly where someone was when they were exposed. But..staying out of those larger crowds is what keeps us safe.””

## Delta Airlines will ban passengers who refuse to wear a mask

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/delta-airlines-will-ban-passengers-who-refuse-wear-mask-1513424):

> Delta has become the latest major U.S airline to say it will ban passengers from future travel if they refuse to wear a face covering while on board the aircraft. As of May 11, all passengers and crew members are required to wear a face covering when flying with any of the five major U.S airlines. Delta has now joined United Airlines and American Airlines in stating that they could place travelers on internal travel restriction lists if they violate safety policies, taking away their privilege of using the airline in the future.

> Reminds me that Japan never shut down, but instead, a majority of their people just wore masks and their COVID death toll is less than 1000 after all this.

> That should tell you something about masks and how effective they are...and also how many lives here could have been saved if everyone just wore masks from the beginning.
