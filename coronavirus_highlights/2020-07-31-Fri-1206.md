## Fauci to testify before U.S. House COVID-19 panel after being blocked by White House

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fauci-idUSKCN24W1GS):

> WASHINGTON - Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, will testify on Friday before a coronavirus subcommittee in Congress, weeks after President Donald Trump's administration first refused to let him address the panel. Democrats said the Trump administration initially prevented Fauci from testifying to the panel by saying he was unavailable for the entire month of July and relented only after House Majority Whip James Clyburn wrote to Vice President Mike Pence. A veteran of six Republican and Democratic administrations, Fauci has become the most familiar face of the administration's coronavirus task force.

> Myself [and others have noticed some "irregularities" in reported case counts recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/hzg8y5/the_white_house_and_hhs_may_be_cooking_the/).  It appears to have started right around the time the White House insisted that hospitals report numbers to HHS rather than the CDC -- around July 13-16.  
> 
> Trends for states suddenly changed right around that time, and reported daily cases that were rapidly increasing suddenly went flat for multiple days and often dropped afterward.  The shape of the case curve doesn't fit what we've seen before: usually public health measures gradually bend the curve, they don't suddenly change trends overnight. [This change is most visible when looking at the 7 day averages for new daily cases](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&highlight=California&show=us-states&y=both&scale=linear&data=cases-daily-7&data-source=jhu&xaxis=right-12wk#states-normalized).  Additionally there are discrepancies in the before vs. after behavior for specific states depending on the political affiliation of the states.   **To people familiar with how real-world data behaves, this looks suspicious, and it seems to reduce the number of reported cases vs what we'd expect from the trend before this.  The timing is also suspicious.**
> 
> I wonder if they'll ask the public health experts about the switch in reporting cases to HHS rather than the CDC?   I hope someone has enough experience working with data to question them about this... what could it mean?

## Bill Gates on Elon Musk’s controversial coronavirus comments: Stick with electric cars and rockets

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-on-elon-musks-coronavirus-comments-he-should-stick-with-electric-cars-and-rockets-2020-07-28):

> That's Microsoft MSFT, -0.43% co-founder Bill Gates explaining to CNBC why Tesla TSLA, -3.34% boss Elon Musk should perhaps focus on his job and let the experts focus on theirs. Musk has courted controversy ever since the coronavirus first broke out across the U.S., having suggested deaths have been overcounted and lockdowns were unnecessary. Gates pointed out that facts travel slowly across social media compared with misinformation, which poses a challenge to Facebook FB, +7.67% and Twitter TWTR, -1.41%. "When you let people communicate, you have to deal with the fact that certain incorrect things that are very titillating can spread very rapidly compared to the truth. And we've always seen that with vaccines," Gates, who's been the subject of conspiracy theories, told CNBC. "To the degree to which these media companies can see what's being said on their platform and take things that are absolutely wrong and get rid of those things or slow those things down, that's very tough."

> Elon Musk was a loud voice for anti stay-at-home orders folks when they were in place and has been spreading all kind of BS theories about COVID. He doesn't give a fuck about the virus or his workers as long as he keeps making money. Dude's a hack.

## COVID-19 hospital data is a hot mess after feds take control

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/covid-19-hospital-data-is-a-hot-mess-after-feds-take-control/):

> The Trump administration issued a directive to hospitals and states July 10, instructing them to stop submitting their daily COVID-19 hospital data to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-which has historically handled such public health data-and instead submit it to a new database in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services. Some larger hospital systems have been working to write new scripts to automate new data mining, while others are relying on staff to compile the data manually into excel spreadsheets, which can take multiple hours each day, according to a report by Healthcare IT News. The COVID Tracking Project-which collects data on a variety of COVID-19 pandemic metrics-wrote in a blog post July 28 that US hospitalization data is no longer reliable.

## 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now “nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/30/mj-hegar/how-many-texans-cant-access-health-insurance-cover/):

> In May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace tax credits. The report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic. Hegar said 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now "Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don't have access to health care insurance."

`/u/StoopidN00b` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/i1722k/1_in_5_texans_did_not_have_health_insurance/):

> This is going to be another major blow to the economy that I almost never hear anyone talking about. A lot of Americans are going to have to throw a lot of their marginal income on health care costs. That's money that is not going to be going to other stuff, and will further stall the economy.
