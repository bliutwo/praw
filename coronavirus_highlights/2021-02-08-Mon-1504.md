## Ron Wright: Republican congressman dies after contracting Covid

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ron-wright-covid-texas-republican-b1799276.html):

> Texas Republican representative Ron Wright, who previously battled cancer, has died at the age of 67 after testing positive for coronavirus. At the time of his diagnosis, Mr Wright confirmed that he was experiencing "Minor symptoms", but his campaign announced on Monday that he had died following his battle with Covid-19. "Congressman Wright will be remembered as a constitutional conservative. He was a statesman, not an ideologue," a statement released by Mr Wright's office on Monday read. "Ron and Susan dedicated their lives to fighting for individual freedom, Texas values, and above all, the lives of the unborn," it added.

Some report hair loss, rashes, blood clots, and organ damage in the heart, lungs or brain.

## BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine should work against virus variants: Study | Jab prompted strong antibody response to South African and UK variants.

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.eu/article/biontech-pfizer-vaccine-should-work-against-virus-variants-study/):

> The BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine should grant protection against both the South African and British variants, according to an article published in Nature Medicine Monday. The researchers tested the blood sera of participants who had been given the vaccine against virus samples that were genetically modified to resemble the variants, finding that the antibodies responded to these viruses. In South Africa, a study suggesting the jab isn't effective in preventing mild to moderate illness caused by the variant originating there has prompted the government to halt plans to roll out the vaccine for front line health workers.

`/u/DonnyMox` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfb4pv/biontechpfizer_vaccine_should_work_against_virus/):

> After hearing that the Oxford one is only 10% effective against the South African variant, this is refreshing to hear.
