Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/n-j-gov-says-u-s-needs-national-pandemic-strategy-n1232924):

> WASHINGTON - Two governors from opposite parties issued warnings Sunday to Americans celebrating the Independence Day holiday as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage across the country, stressing the importance of wearing masks to curb the spread.In an interview with "Meet the Press," Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., whose state saw one of the earlier coronavirus spikes, recounted the "Enormous price" the state has already paid - more than 13,000 dead from the virus. Murphy said Americans should continue to follow public health guidelines but also called for a national strategy that he said is imperative to controlling the virus' spread. The White House has repeatedly deferred to state and local officials, instead offering unenforced guidelines and sending mixed messages on things like masks. While masks were available to attendees, neither masks nor social distancing were required, something Gov. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., lamented on "Meet the Press."

> I am terrified what will happen to some of my family members who are teachers and in their 60s. These school systems just sent them out to die. We don't even have mandatory masks in Georgia. I don't know what to do. We have this petition that needs to pick up steam - change.org/masksforgeorgia. That's really it. Leadership fucking sucks here.
