## Tom Hanks on surviving coronavirus: 'I had crippling body aches, fatigue and couldn't concentrate'

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/tom-hanks-on-surviving-coronavirus-i-had-crippling-body-aches-fatigue-and-couldnt-concentrate):

> "Welcome to the future, Hadley!" Tom Hanks says from my computer screen, as he makes a quick glance to the right of his own to check my name. On the day Hanks and I speak, the infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci is warning that, unless current US outbreaks are contained, the rate of coronavirus infections could reach 100,000 a day. If, at the end of the 80s, you were asked who THE big star of the 90s would be, your answer would likely have been Eddie Murphy or Tom Cruise - but it was Hanks.

## No, the Americans With Disabilities Act doesn't say shop owners have to let maskless people into their stores

Summary of [original article](https://respectfulinsolence.com/2020/07/06/americans-with-disabilities-act-mask-lie/):

> The politicization of public health mandates is not new, but what is unprecedented is the level of politicization we are seeing now, including the Americans With Disabilities Act that the same politicization has infected the response to COVID-19, in particular, the discussion over whether mandates requiring mask wearing as a strategy to slow the spread of coronavirus. As noted by the Department of Justice, the card may include a message suggesting that exemption from face mask rules is allowed because of the Americans with Disabilities Act - but it's all a sham. The Department of Justice has been made aware of postings or flyers on the internet regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act and the use of face masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which include the Department of Justice's seal.

> In this case, there is a “**direct threat**” exception to the ADA where a disability that poses a threat to others’ safety does NOT need to be accommodated.
> 
> It hasn’t been litigated, but I am 100% certain the ADA doesn’t allow these idiots to refuse to wear face masks.

> A meeting with Trump is pointless- the man will not honor any agreement or deal he makes and his inner circle is infested with coronavirus- Trudeau doesnt need to put his staff at risk so Trump can have a photo op standing next to a halfway competent adult.
