> Thank you for making this thread. Even though I’m not working tomorrow, which is unusual (I’m a critical care doc at a hospital - will not say more for anonymity), I’ll be spending the holidays alone. I haven’t seen my family since March, and I don’t have the heart to take a chance and potentially expose all of them given my higher risk occupation and their ages, as desperate as I am to see all of them in person. 
> 
> I plan to celebrate by making nachos incorporating some home-grown veggies and chilies, and watch a movie or two before I get back to work Friday! And in the evening, I’ll get on FaceTime and get nostalgic with close family. I realize this might sound depressing, but I choose to stay optimistic with vaccinations and more rational national leadership around the corner. I also recognize as a physician, I need to live by the example I preach to others. 
> 
> In the spirit of the holiday, I’d like to take a moment and say thank you to all of my fellow community members. Thank you for your enlightening comments, your dedication to sharing vital news and information about the ongoing pandemic, and your advocacy for sanity - masks, social distancing, and empathy for your fellow citizen. Please stay safe out there!
