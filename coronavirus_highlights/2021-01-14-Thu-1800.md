> Tbh Iâ€™m so burned out that Iâ€™ve started filtering it out and focusing on what I can do: wear a mask, wash my hands, socially distance, and wait for my turn to get the vaccine.
> 
> Otherwise, itâ€™s just extra stress for something I canâ€™t control more than I already am.

> I live in LA and this is bone chilling to hear.  More and more friends are getting sick but even still I hadnâ€™t a sense of it being THIS bad.
> 
> This just really feels like weâ€™ve failed now.  Certainly the USA lost the battle early on but now it really feels like the part where the raiders are coming in to sack the village.  Weâ€™re fucked.

## Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s single-shot coronavirus vaccine on track for March, exec says

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7575582/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-rollout-march/):

> Johnson & Johnson is on track to roll out its single-shot coronavirus vaccine in March, and expects to have clear data on how effective it is by the end of this month or early February, the U.S. healthcare company's chief scientific officer said. EXPECTATION FOR HIGH EFFICACY. Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser for the U.S. Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, said on Wednesday the vaccine could show efficacy at or above 80%. That would be below the efficacy of about 95% achieved in trials of already authorized vaccines from Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc, but well above the 50% benchmark for approval set by regulators. Canada has signed a deal with Johnson & Johnson to receive up to 38 million doses of its vaccine if it is approved for use.
