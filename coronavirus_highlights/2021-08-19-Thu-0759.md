> I am a teacher in Washington state! Happy to hear this. I can’t read the article, but if anyone is interested here are some notes from educators union: 
> 
> - ~90% of educators are already vaccinated according to National Educators Association
> 
> - By October 18th means in effect by then, so really the last day to get the shot is October 4th 
> 
> - Medical and religious exemptions will be allowed. The state has not yet defined the protocol for claiming those exemptions 
> 
> - Educators who don’t get a shot by October 4th will be released from employment and be ineligible for unemployment benefits
> 
> - Precedent has been set, there is no legal grounds to fight the vaccination mandate 
> 
> - Local teachers unions can’t fight mandate, but they can bargain the impact of this requirement
> 
> EDIT: Been reading comments from other WA educators in a Facebook group, so take the following with a grain of salt. It seems how to do religious exemption is going to be up to local control, so it seems very possible educators will just need to fill out an attestation form to be approved for exemption. Some are hopeful that a religious leader may need to sign off on the religious exemption and school may consult religious experts if necessary.
