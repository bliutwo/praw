> >One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%. All results were statistically significant (p<=0.0001).

## Rural Areas Send Their Sickest Patients To The Cities, Straining Hospital Capacity

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/23/933843172/rural-areas-send-their-sickest-patients-to-the-cities-straining-hospital-capacit):

> As Rural COVID Patients Are Moved To Nearby Cities, Hospitals Struggle To Cope : Shots - Health News In Kansas City, hospitals are treating local COVID-19 patients as well as patients transferred from rural counties in Missouri and Kansas, where there's no mandate or culture for wearing masks. Critically ill rural patients are often sent to city hospitals for high-level treatment, and as their numbers grow, some urban hospitals are buckling under the added strain. In an email, Dave Dillon with the Missouri Hospital Association agreed that rural patients might be contributing to hospital crowding in cities, but argued the strain on hospitals is a statewide problem.

> >Although the Texas Department of Criminal Justice reported Johnson’s death as being in the line of duty, the state Office of Risk Management has denied his family’s workers’ compensation claim. 
> 
> >In a letter denying the claim, the agency said it was “currently unable to accept this claim as a compensable injury that occurred in the course and scope of employment.” Johnson’s widow is appealing the denial. 
> 
> This sounds sort of similar to how all disability claims are initially denied to try and get people to give up and go away.  This is the sort of thing that lawyers will eventually sort out.  It is just incredibly infuriating that this grieving family will have to jump through hoops to get what they are due.

## Vitamin D can help fight COVID-19, Belgian researchers say

Summary of [original article](https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-11-21/Vitamin-D-can-help-fight-COVID-19-Belgian-researchers-say-Vynl5roIXS/index.html):

> Researchers in Belgium have discovered a "Clear link" between low levels of vitamin D and the severity of COVID-19 cases. Studies consistently show that at least 40 percent of the Belgian population has inadequate levels of vitamin D, known as the "Sunshine vitamin." But scientist from AZ Delta hospital in West Flanders, who analyzed blood samples from 186 people during the first wave of the pandemic, found that severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted for care showed much higher rates of vitamin D deficiency. "At this moment it's a bridge too far to say that vitamin D is a therapeutic for COVID-19, but for sure it makes a call for maintaining your body at optimal form and making sure you're not vitamin D deficient," he said.

> Meanwhile, my jaw hit the floor today...
> 
> HUGE spike in people searching for: Covid test, Covid testing, and Covid symptoms on Google this morning. Largest yet by a long shot. Top states, in order:
> 
> New York, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Iowa, New Jersey, Nebraska, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Maine, Virginia, S. Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, S. Carolina, Texas...
> 
> Expect to see huge numbers as far as positive tests within the next 2-3 weeks and grow from there.
> 
> I’d be willing to bet the farm that this week will go down in history as the largest spreading event in history with all the travel and Thanksgiving. It will take about 4-6 weeks to see the beginning of the spike on top of the spike.
> 
> This is what exponential growth looks like. This is just the beginning. So frustrating watching all this happen in real time - it’s been easy to track what places will become the next hot spot weeks in advance. And lately it’s pretty much nationwide.
> 
> In the past 4 hours, every state in the US except 4 leads with the google search: Covid testing
> 
> We are going to absolutely explode in cases and hospitalizations in about 4 weeks - on top of everything that is happening.
> 
> If there was a worse case scenario outline I needed to draft back in March, as far as what would Nov need to look like to create the ultimate nightmare for year end, this is it.
> 
> I can’t believe we are still wide open. If some random dude can access this data and see what’s happening in real time and track everything, I can’t imagine the data the Gov has, yet they choose to stay open.
> 
> At this point, I see every warning sign there is that would point to an immediate full stop lockdown. This is going to be beyond bad. Shit.
