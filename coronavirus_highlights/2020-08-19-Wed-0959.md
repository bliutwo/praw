## 'They put us all in danger': UNC-Chapel Hill students outraged after quick shift to virtual learning

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/they-put-us-all-danger-unc-chapel-hill-students-outraged-n1237200):

> The university, which disregarded concerns from faculty members, staff workers, Black student leaders, student campus leaders and local county health officials to become one of the largest campuses in the country to reopen for students amid the coronavirus pandemic, announced Monday that it was shifting to fully remote learning after reporting 135 new COVID-19 cases and four clusters. The flagship campus at UNC has close to 30,000 students, including graduate students. The University of Notre Dame on Tuesday suspended in-person classes after 146 students and one staff member tested positive for COVID-19, while Ithaca College announced it was extending remote learning and not welcoming students back for the fall semester.

## Most Americans embarrassed by U.S. response to coronavirus, CNN poll finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/most-americans-embarrassed-by-u-s-response-to-coronavirus-cnn-poll-finds-1.5070410):

> Nearly 7 in 10 Americans say the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak makes them feel embarrassed, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, as 62% of the public says President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak. The poll finds a decline in the share of Americans who say they would try to get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine became widely available at a low cost: 56% say they would try to do so now, while 66% felt that way in May. The dip comes across several demographic divides but seems to be concentrated among Trump supporters, 51% of whom said they would seek out a vaccine in May compared with 38% who say the same now. In one positive note for Trump in these findings, his approval rating for handling the economy has ticked up to 51%. But Americans don't yet see much improvement in the economic downturn caused by th4e coronavirus.

`/u/OrionBell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/icoy8o/most_americans_embarrassed_by_us_response_to/):

> It's more than embarrassing. It's infuriating how selfish and unpatriotic a portion of our society is, and how they are being encouraged by bad leadership. Yes, I am embarrassed by the response of the American government, but I am ashamed and outraged by the minority of our citizens who just don't care about anybody except themselves. Shame on you people who act like that. If you had enough self-awareness to be embarrassed, we wouldn't have to shun you and shame you and cut you from our social circles and look upon you with disgust for the rest of your lives.

## We could end the coronavirus by winter if we switch to rapid tests

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/08/17/rapid-coronavirus-testing-pcr/):

> More rapid tests are under development that could help get the epidemic under control, even though they aren't as accurate as the ones that take longer. Testing is not only a means of diagnosis for an individual - it is a critical lever for preventing spread to others, and so far, it's been badly underused in the response to the pandemic here. The same "Warp speed" push that's accelerating vaccine development should also help encourage rapid testing platforms that can be configured to new pathogens as they arise so that we are always a step ahead of future threats.

`/u/Kuzkuladaemon` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/icmefu/we_could_end_the_coronavirus_by_winter_if_we/):

> Wait, testing doesn't guarantee anything. The people with the anti-science rhetoric won't be corrected by tests.
