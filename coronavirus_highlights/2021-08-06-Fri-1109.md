## FAQ: Recent CDC Guidance, Vaccine Data, and the Delta Variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/owyf0w/faq_recent_cdc_guidance_vaccine_data_and_the/):

> Combined with the Indian report showing an association between the Delta variants and larger transmission cluster sizes, this data all supports the transmission dynamics estimate of R0 to support the notion that the Delta variant is markedly more transmissible than are ancestral strains. All of the above studies observed a decrease in vaccine efficacy in preventing infection with the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant. Though the sample sizes and relatively distinctive circumstances of the outbreak preclude generalization about vaccine efficacy, the RT-qPCR data here appears to corroborate the concerns raised by the Indian report and the internal CDC tracking of breakthrough cases, suggesting that vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections are likely as capable of transmitting the Delta variant as are unvaccinated infected individuals.

Those who provide proof by Sept. 20 will receive a full day’s pay, excluding pilots and flight attendants who have already received a union-negotiated bonus for getting vaccinated. So far, about 90 percent of United’s pilots and 80 percent of its flight attendants have been vaccinated, the airline said.

## 11-month-old with COVID sent to hospital 150 miles away due to lack of bed space in Houston

Summary of [original article](https://abc7ny.com/baby-with-covid-treated-at-hospital-150-miles-away-cases-us-pediatric-capacity/10934562/):

> HOUSTON - In a sign that the delta variant is affecting more children on a daily basis, an 11-month-old Texas girl had to be airlifted to a hospital 150 miles away because no local pediatric hospitals would accept her as a transfer patient. "The emergency rooms at the major children's hospitals here in Houston, the largest medical center in the world, are extremely crowded," she said. Respiratory Syncytial Virus is also increasing in the area, sending more children to hospitals.

## Delta Tops 80% of All NYC COVID Strains, Entire City Now a “High Transmission” Area

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/delta-tops-80-of-all-nyc-covid-strains-entire-city-now-a-high-transmission-area/3205680/):

> The highly transmissible delta variant continues to burn through New York City, now accounting for 83% of all positive samples - and every key indicator in the city is moving in the wrong direction. It took only 14 days for delta to vault from the fourth most common COVID strain in the city to the first, overtaking first the so-called New York City strain that initially emerged in Washington Heights before spreading elsewhere, as well as other fast-spreading variants that first emerged in the UK and Brazil. The Delta variant of COVID-19 is in New York City - and Staten Island is seeing a higher caseload than any other part of the city.

> New York City’s current hospitalization rate of 0.82/100,000 is 85% below the winter peak.

> I’m not saying that everything is over, but some perspective is needed.
