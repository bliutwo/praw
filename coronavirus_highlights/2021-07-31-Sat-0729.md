## Germany could make unvaccinated pay for COVID tests

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-could-make-unvaccinated-pay-for-covid-tests-report/a-58713602):

> The government will stop paying for rapid antigen tests after sufficient numbers of German residents have been fully vaccinated, according to the Bild newspaper. Scholz reportedly supported the measure because progress in getting people vaccinated meant that public funds shouldn't be used to test those who are unvaccinated for free. Free tests are costing the government €3.4 billion, according to Bild.

> That’s a horrible idea. Then they just won’t get tested and go spreading it around.

## Extroverted, self-centred men less likely to comply with Covid restrictions, study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/31/extroverted-self-centred-men-less-likely-to-comply-with-covid-restrictions-study-suggests):

> People who do not comply with Covid-19 pandemic restrictions are mostly male, more extroverted and more likely to put their own self-interests above those of others, suggests a new study of behaviours internationally. People who complied with restrictions were more likely to cope positively using strategies including self-distraction, while rule flouters tended to resort to "Denial, substance use, and behavioural disengagement", the researchers found. The non-compliant group was also more likely to perceive restrictions as a threat to individual freedoms.

## Texas just passed New York in COVID deaths, despite once trailing by 29,000. Here's how.

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Texas-New-York-COVID-deaths-case-numbers-16352409.php):

> Texas has passed New York to become the state with the second-most COVID-19 deaths, a feat experts say was driven by an inability to control transmission of the virus here. Texas reached the milestone Wednesday, hitting 53,275 deaths, despite trailing New York by more than 29,000 fatalities last summer. Spencer Fox, associate director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, said he was surprised Texas had not passed New York in mortality sooner, since the northeastern state did a far better job limiting the spread of virus after it endured a horrific surge last spring.
