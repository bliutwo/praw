## Fauci says he would be ‘astounded’ if Pfizer, Moderna and J&J Covid vaccines don’t get full FDA approval

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/fauci-says-he-would-be-astounded-if-pfizer-moderna-and-jj-covid-vaccines-dont-get-full-fda-approval.html):

> Some people have argued that full approval of the vaccines would convince Americans on the fence to get the shots and give businesses more confidence to implement vaccine mandates. Fauci's appearance on CNBC comes one day after U.S. health officials, including Fauci, met with representatives from vaccine maker Pfizer to discuss the potential need for Covid booster shots. Fauci described Monday's talk with Pfizer has mostly "a courtesy meeting." However, he emphasized that the discussion around booster shots "Has absolutely nothing to do with the effectiveness of the vaccine."

## California to bar K-12 students from campus if they refuse to wear a mask under new rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-12/california-k-12-students-mask-rules):

> The complications of managing COVID-era education took a dramatic turn Monday, when state officials issued a rule barring unmasked students from campuses, and then, hours later, rescinded that rule - while keeping in place a mask mandate for all at K-12 schools. At 7:25 p.m., the California Department of Public Health tweeted out a change of direction: "California's school guidance will be clarified regarding masking enforcement, recognizing local schools' experience in keeping students and educators safe while ensuring schools fully reopen for in-person instruction." "There are 50k maskless Dodger fans drinking, eating and shouting: no testing, masking, screening or vaccination mandate. But schools aren't safe?" said Christie Pesicka, an elementary school parent in Los Angeles and a leader of the local parents group California Students United.

This is kindergarten level stuff too, if you're not willing to be a part of the solution why should we accommodate you.
