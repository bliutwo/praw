> >About  one in eight (13%) Americans will travel for Christmas this year.  Almost twice as many (24%) say they would normally travel but won’t this  year because of the pandemic. Another 5% say they would usually travel  but are skipping the trip this year for reasons unrelated to the  pandemic.    
> >  
> >This  suggests that in a normal year, 42% of Americans would be traveling for  the holiday. The fact that just 13% still intend to do so indicates a  69% reduction in participation.

## Despite mistrust, Native Americans’ participation in vaccine development proves vital

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistrust-native-americans-participation-vaccine-development-proves-vital/story?id=74879531):

> Christensen is developing the Navajo Nation's vaccine plan and is helping distribute and administer the shot to health care workers like EMS, medical practitioners and medicine men in the initial phase of the process. Gwen Livingston, a Johns Hopkins American Indian Health research nurse, has been working with Pfizer and partner BioNTech on their COVID-19 vaccine trials in the Navajo Nation amid a second, deadlier wave. In 2002, the Navajo Nation banned genetic research on its territory in order to prevent unethical medical experiments on Native Americans.

## Schools "may need to close to control new variant"

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55437283):

> There is still much uncertainty and the study uses mathematical modelling to analyse trends in the variant's spread. It said data on people's movements, from surveys and Google, could not explain the variant's surge. Dr Nick Davies, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said rapid vaccination should blunt the impact of the new variant. There is no evidence to suggest the variant is itself more dangerous or able to cause more severe disease.

## Tel Aviv research: 99.9% of COVID-19 germs dead in 30 seconds with UV LEDs

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/health-science/tel-aviv-research-999-percent-of-covid-19-germs-dead-in-30-seconds-with-uv-leds-653315):

> Now, researchers from Tel Aviv University have proven that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can be killed efficiently, quickly and cheaply using ultraviolet light-emitting diodes at specific frequencies. These ultraviolet wavelengths, which are what Tel Aviv researchers were examining, are especially effective in disinfection using UV-LED bulbs. "The disinfection systems based on LED bulbs can be installed in the ventilation system and air conditioner, for example, and sterilize the air sucked in and then emitted into the room."She added that, "We are also developing, together with a scientist in North Western University a transparent coating that can be dipped or sprayed on surfaces and can kill viruses using visible light LEDs that are not dangerous and are used everywhere, providing another application for regular LEDs."In her team's research, they managed to kill the virus using cheaper and more readily available LED bulbs - 285 nm vs. 265 nm bulbs - which consume little energy and do not contain mercury like regular UV lamps.
