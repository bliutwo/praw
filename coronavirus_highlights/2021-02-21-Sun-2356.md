## Glasses-wearers up to three times less likely to catch coronavirus, study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/glasses-coronavirus-covid-contacts-study-b1805314.html):

> People who wear glasses could be up to three times less likely to be infected by coronavirus, a study from India has suggested. Researchers in India say people who wear glasses rub their eyes less and are therefore at less risk of contracting Covid-19. The researchers found participants touched their face up to 23 times each hour on average and their eyes an average of three times per hour.

> >People who wear glasses could be up to three times less likely to be infected by coronavirus , a study from India has suggested. One way the virus can enter the body is by people touching their eyes, nose or mouth after coming into contact with it. However, researchers in India say people who wear glasses rub their eyes less and are therefore at less risk of contracting Covid-19 .

> Edit: I wear glasses all day and caught coronavirus in July. Mama always said I’m special.

## Pandemic's mental health burden heaviest among young adults

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/pandemics-mental-health-burden-heaviest-young-adults/story?id=75811308):

> "The mental health impact of the pandemic is much larger on younger adults," said Dr. Shekhar Saxena of The Harvard School of Public Health and a professor for the practice of global mental health courts. Experts fear many of those affected are not seeking the professional help they need, and Dr. Sarah Lipson, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Law Policy and Management at the Boston University School of Public Health and co-principal investigator of the Healthy Minds Network study, told ABC News experts are trying to quantify that. Mental Health America found that between April and September of last year 70% of people reported that loneliness or isolation was the top contributing factor to mental health issues.

## Coronavirus latest: US cases show encouraging trend as hospital admissions decline for 40th day

Summary of [original article](https://www.ft.com/content/741090f3-5023-3a78-a9d3-0d7b394f2616):

> The World Health Organization has pleaded with Tanzania to take more measures to control the coronavirus pandemic as more than nine months have passed since the east African nation provided any update on cases. Tanzania has reported 509 cases with 21 deaths among its 58m people, but has not released any data since May 2020. "I renew my call for Tanzania to start reporting Covid-19 cases and share data."

`/u/IanMazgelis` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lpcyvt/coronavirus_latest_us_cases_show_encouraging/):

> I can't find an article on it, but the rolling average of daily deaths is down by about forty percent since Valentine's day. It dropped by forty percent in one week. That's obviously mirroring the dramatic case drop we've been seeing for about six weeks now, but if it were to continue mirroring that decline, we'd be in an outstanding position.
