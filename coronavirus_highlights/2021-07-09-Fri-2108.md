> I am so freaking angry right now. No this is not only to blame on the Deltavariant. This is the fault of our goverment. Fully responsable for this wave of infections. With just one vaccin and no waiting time people were allowed to go to the club and hug eachother. Also the masks are not manditory anymore. All decided on one day. Well how can you not expect this to happen? Its stupidity at its finest. I am a 24 young person not fully vaccinated and waiting for my second not fully protected. A lot of my friends got corona the last week and I am back in isolation. If we just calmed down a bit and not make fast radical descisions on opening up again like the rest of the world (except UK ofcourse, sorry) we are good. But wait for the biggest descisions when youve reached a good level of herd immunity. Urghhh!!!

## U.S. vaccination campaign prevented up to 279,000 COVID-19 deaths

Summary of [original article](https://news.yale.edu/2021/07/08/us-vaccination-campaign-prevented-279000-covid-19-deaths):

> The coordinated and rapid COVID-19 vaccination campaign launched in the United States late last year has saved some 279,000 lives and prevented 1.25 million hospitalizations, a new study led by the Yale School of Public Health finds. In their model, they also compared health trends with two hypothetical scenarios - one in which no vaccination program was administered and one in which only half as many daily vaccinations were given. If only half as many vaccinations had been administered there would have been more than 120,000 additional deaths and 450,000 additional hospitalizations, according to the researchers.

> 'Just like the flu. You know how many times I've heard idiots say that...too many. 30-60k in normal flu related deaths don't compare to over 600K dead people.

## Delta variant said to be far more widespread than federal estimates

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/08/delta-coronavirus-variant-widespread-498787):

> The CDC has offered to help several states battling the Delta variant speed up the sequencing process, multiple state public health officials told POLITICO. The Biden administration also is sending top health officials like Anthony Fauci, the president's chief medical officer, to communities to help convince unvaccinated people to get the shot. "It is far more infectious than the original strain that hit back in 2020. It is far more infectious than the Alpha variant. It is really important people understand this is a different situation we're in. If you are unvaccinated there is a very good chance you are going to become sick [with Delta]." Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis asked the CDC to help investigate the proliferation of the Delta variant in the western part of his state.

`/u/Argos_the_Dog` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oh2ya8/delta_variant_said_to_be_far_more_widespread_than/):

> Sounds like a great reason to go get vaccinated if you have not already.
