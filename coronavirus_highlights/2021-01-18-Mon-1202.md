## ‘I’ve never seen so many nurses cry’ – the mental health of NHS workers is on the brink

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nhs-nurses-medical-staff-covid-mental-health-b1788864.html):

> "The extra support we had in the first wave, with free food, transport, and extra pay for additional shifts has been scrapped. Many of us are not from the UK, feel isolated and drained, and haven't seen our families for eight or nine months. I have never seen so many nurses cry during shifts. Every shift is a struggle." A study of 2,707 healthcare workers identified several factors associated with staff burnout during the Covid-19 pandemic. The support provided to staff during the first wave, such as free parking, food, accommodation, access to psychologists and wellbeing hubs, is no longer in place at most trusts, at a time when the staff need it the most.

> Mental health of people in most workplaces is on the fucking brink. If we lose nurses and hospital staff gonna be no one left to take care of us. Look after them.

Summary of [original article](https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/coronavirus/covid-19-cases-have-been-on-the-decline-in-36-states-and-territories-in-last-week-group-says):

> The COVID Tracking Project reports that in the past week, new cases of COVID-19 have been falling in 36 states and territories across the U.S. In another 12 states and territories, cases are holding level, while cases are only rising in three. According to the COVID Tracking Project, the seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases has plummeted by about 30,000 in the past week. Health experts say that deaths lag behind trends in new cases and hospitalizations by a week or two, meaning that there could still be a surge in COVID-19 deaths this week.

> SAN ANTONIO - The Val Verde County Judge said someone from the Del Río area may have knowingly exposed hundreds of people to COVID-19 at a country music event in San Antonio. In the post, Owens was specifically calling out a girl from the Del Río area who he said went to a Cody Johnson concert at Cowboys Dancehall this past weekend, knowing she was positive for COVID-19."There's Snapchat pictures evidently that y'all took with your mask on your wrist and y'all having a good time. You're positive, lady. You should've never left," Owens said in the post. The girl Owens was referring to was issued a citation, and the judge said he plans to release her name as soon as possible to make an example out of her.
