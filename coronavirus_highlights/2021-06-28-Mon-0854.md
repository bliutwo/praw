## A study finds that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines could offer protection for years.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/28/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask/a-study-finds-that-the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-could-offer-protection-for-years):

> Administering the vaccines in either order is likely to provide potent protection, Matthew Snape, a vaccine expert at the University of Oxford, said at a news conference on Monday. The AstraZeneca vaccine has won authorization in 80 countries since last December but is not approved for use in the United States, which already has more than enough doses of its three authorized vaccines to meet demand. Professor Pollard said the study would compare the effects of a third dose of the original vaccine against those of boosting volunteers with the new Beta-targeted vaccine.

## Gottlieb says parts of U.S. could see "very dense outbreaks" as Delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gottlieb-covid-19-delta-variant-face-the-nation/):

> Washington - As the U.S. continues to navigate its way through the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said areas of the country could experience "Very dense outbreaks" with the concerning Delta variant continuing to circulate. Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a state where hospital admissions are up 30%, expressed concern about the Delta COVID-19 variant and low vaccination rates in his state. "The Delta variant is a great concern to us. We see that impacting our increasing cases and hospitalizations," Hutchinson said on "Face the Nation." The governor also noted that vaccine hesitancy is high in his state, which he attributed to conspiracy theories, the pause in Johnson & Johnson's one-shot regimen in April and individuals simply not believing in the efficacy of the virus.
