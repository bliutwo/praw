## Dr. Fauci: Coronavirus Was ‘Allowed’ to Perpetuate in the U.S. Because ‘Only About 50 Percent of the Country Locked Down’

Summary of [original article](https://www.mediaite.com/radio/dr-fauci-coronavirus-was-allowed-to-perpetuate-in-the-u-s-because-only-about-50-percent-of-the-country-locked-down/):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States is facing a resurgence of the coronavirus because the country didn't take lockdowns far enough during the first wave of the pandemic. "What we've seen over the last several days is a spike in cases that are way beyond the worst spikes that we've seen," Fauci said. "In the United States," Fauci said, "Even in the most strict lockdown, only about 50 percent of the country locked down."

> >“You’ve been losing this battle, haven’t you?” the BBC host asked Fauci regarding that sentiment.
> 
> >“Admittedly yes, we have,” Fauci said. “We cannot give up because it appears that we’re losing the battle.”
> 
> I agree we can't give up but with 50,000 cases a day and a complete lack of a federal track and trace program it seems we already have given up. At this point it is hard to imagine how we can ever get this back under control...

> Great move. If it's not enforced by law and penalty, it won't matter.

## In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can’t Have Both.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/covid-economy-parents-kids-career-homeschooling.html):

> The sadder flip side - the friend who told me that if their school reopens, her children are going back whether it's safe or not because she cannot afford to not work - edges closer. Despite our own financial strain, we've continued to pay the nanny who used to help shuttle the kids around while we worked, even though she hasn't worked for us since March. Allowing workplaces to reopen while schools, camps and day cares remain closed tells a generation of working parents that it's fine if they lose their jobs, insurance and livelihoods in the process.

`/u/Dfiggsmeister` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hjuklw/in_the_covid19_economy_you_can_have_a_kid_or_a/):

> Depends on your job/company. But for essential workers and those that work in blue collar or in service industries, they’re right. You have to choose between watching your kid and making sure they do their work online or going to work to earn money. 
> 
> For single parent households, this is an impossibility. For dual parent households, one or both parents will have to sacrifice.
