## Alabama doctor says he won’t treat unvaccinated people: ‘COVID is miserable way to die’

Summary of [original article](https://www.al.com/news/2021/08/alabama-doctor-says-he-wont-treat-unvaccinated-people-covid-is-miserable-way-to-die.html):

> An Alabama doctor is taking a bold stance in the efforts to get more people vaccinated against COVID-19.Dr. Jason Valentine, a physician at Mobile's Diagnostic and Medical Clinic Infirmary Health, posted a photo on his Facebook page showing him posed next to a sign that says "Effective Oct. 1, 2021, Dr. Valentine will no longer see patients that are not vaccinated against COVID-19.". Since posting the sign, Valentine wrote that three unvaccinated patients asked where they could get a vaccine. "We do not yet have any great treatments for severe disease, but we do have great prevention with vaccines. Unfortunately, many have declined to take the vaccine, and some end up severely ill or dead. I cannot and will not force anyone to take the vaccine, but I also cannot continue to watch my patients suffer and die from an eminently preventable disease," the letter said.

Unfortunately, many have declined to take the vaccine, and some end up severely ill or dead. I cannot and will not force anyone to take the vaccine, but I also cannot continue to watch my patients suffer and die from an eminently preventable disease,” the letter said. “Therefore, as of October 1st, 2021, I will no longer see patients that have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. If you wish to keep me as your physician, documentation of your vaccination will suffice. If you wish to choose another physician, we will be happy to transfer your records.”

> He said 3 people have already asked where to get vaccines. Enough carrots, time for sticks.

`/u/CarpeVinum` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5yj23/new_zealand_to_enter_nationwide_lockdown_after_1/):

> This is not the long term strategy for NZ but is the best one at the moment until we hit higher vaccination levels. 
> 
> For huge portions of the last 1 and a half years we have been able to live almost as if there was no pandemic. Life here has been normal. It is a privilege of our isolation, luck and consistent policies as well as large scale compliance by the population. 
> 
> We are so privileged that this is even an option for us and that a lockdown is still (fingers crossed) an effective means to get to zero cases. Obviously this still has a huge impact on people’s mental health, education, employment and I don’t mean to down play that. 
> 
> We do need to ramp up vaccinations as that is the most sustainable way out of this pandemic for us but lockdowns are still a good step until we get those levels up.
