Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/):

> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

> "I don’t socialize. It’s my wife and I and the federal agents. We’ve sort of become like a new family unit," Fauci told HuffPost. "I have federal agents that protect me. So they drive me to work, they stay here, they make sure that nobody tries to break in [to my home] and, as Steve Bannon would like, have somebody behead me."

## Would you be willing to get a Covid vaccine in exchange for a $1,500 stimulus check? How one bold proposal would work

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/1500-stimulus-checks-for-covid-19-shots-how-one-plan-would-work.html):

> Tying stimulus checks to vaccinations would actually be the most effective strategy to stop the virus, and thus curtail the need for other forms of aid, Delaney said. The stimulus checks do not necessarily have to be $1,500, Delaney said. More time would also have to be added on in general for the Treasury Department to verify that people have had their vaccines and cross reference that with other requirements they must meet in order to get stimulus checks.

## Face masks considerably reduce COVID-19 cases in Germany - 20 days after becoming mandatory face masks have reduced the number of new infections by around 45%. Economic costs are close to zero compared to other public health measures.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/02/2015954117):

> Eventually, face masks became mandatory in all federal states between 20 April and 29 April 2020.We quantify the effectiveness of face masks by employing the synthetic control method. While there is a growing consensus from clinical studies that face masks significantly reduce the transmission risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and COVID-19, nonclinical evidence on the effectiveness of face masks is still largely missing. While treatment effects of face masks turn significant after roughly 1 wk for the overall sample, the emergence of a reduction in the subsample of larger cities is fast and points to early anticipation effects of face masks in urban areas, particularly during the period when local economies were gradually reopened after 20 April.
