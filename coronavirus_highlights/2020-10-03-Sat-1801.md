## Negative Covid-19 tests not a substitute for 14-day quarantine

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/negative-covid-19-tests-not-substitute-14-day-quarantine-n1241864):

> Oct. 2, 2020, 6:01 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 2, 2020, 7:32 PM UTC. By Lauren Dunn.The list of close contacts of President Donald Trump who have tested negative for Covid-19 continues to grow, but experts say it doesn't mean they are off the hook: A single negative test doesn't mean a person doesn't have the virus. A White House spokesperson tweeted Friday that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who both attended Tuesday's debate with Democratic nominee Joe Biden, had tested negative. In May, the FDA put out an alert warning doctors that people testing negative with the Abbott ID NOW test may need a second lab-based test.

> Does this means Joe Biden could be infected as well even as he tested negative?
> 
> Srsly 2020 could throw another curve ball where none of the D and R candidate can take part in the election. Very off topic I know.
