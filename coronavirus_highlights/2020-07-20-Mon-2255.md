## BBC News - Coronavirus: Oxford vaccine can train immune system

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53469839):

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford appears safe and trains the immune system. This means the vaccine resembles the coronavirus and the immune system can learn how to attack it. Much of the focus on coronavirus so far has been about antibodies, but these are only one part of our immune defence.

## Unlike the United States, more and more countries are making masks mandatory

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/20/mandatory-face-mask-requirements-global-coronavirus/):

> As countries around the world reopen their economies amid ongoing novel coronavirus outbreaks, governments are increasingly embracing what remains in some places a divisive public health measure: mandatory masks. Although it is difficult to isolate mask use as the key factor in a country's success so far, or draw a direct line between mask mandates and outcomes, many countries where masks were in wide, early use have fared better than those that resisted the broad adoption of face coverings. "We're gathering all this new information and evidence about how effective masks are and it is adding up more and more in favor of masks every day."
