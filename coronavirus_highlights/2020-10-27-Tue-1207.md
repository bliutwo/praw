## Not wearing a mask linked to antisocial traits, study finds. Those who don’t comply with Covid-19 containment measures were found to be more callous, hostile and deceitful

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/mask-wearing-anti-social-personality-traits-study-brazil-b1347252.html?amp):

> The antisocial profile was linked to higher scores in the personality questions related to "Callousness, deceitfulness, hostility, impulsivity, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and risk-taking", antisocial traits which, the study notes, "Are typically present in people diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder". The empathy pattern profile showed higher scores in affective resonance and lower scores in the traits associated with ASPD. The team who conducted the study said they hoped the findings would help to persuade health officials to do more to educate people and influence their policies. While worldwide protests have taken place surrounding mask wearing, their effectiveness continues to be proven in a growing number of studies.

## A 7-hour flight has been linked to 59 coronavirus cases in Ireland, researchers say

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/10/26/ireland-flight-covid/):

> A seven-hour international flight to Ireland this summer has been linked to 59 coronavirus cases in the country, Irish researchers said in a report. Researchers did not clarify where the flight originated but said the cases and their subsequent spread show that "Restriction of movement on arrival and robust contact tracing" can limit travel-linked transmissions of the coronavirus. Symptoms began to appear in the earliest cases two days after the flight, and the latest case linked to the plane experienced symptoms 17 days after the flight.

> I've flown a few times during the pandemic and I treat it as if I'm treating Covid patients.  N95+surgical mask+ glasses+ shield and personal hand sanitizer from the second I enter the airport , until the second I get to my destination.  I'll only fly delta or jet blue since they block the middle seat.   I wipe down the surfaces by my seat as well as create a little barrier with the air vents.  I will not take off my mask to eat or drink.  While not fun, I'm used to it since I work EMS.   I'll also get tested before and after landing.

> EDIT: Apparently from a commenter below jet blue is only blocking seats on certain routes now, I'd recommend checking with them before you book.

## More than 80 per cent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had vitamin D deficiency: study

Summary of [original article](https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/health/2020/10/27/1_5162396.html):

> TORONTO - More than 80 per cent of COVID-19 patients at a hospital in Spain had a vitamin D deficiency, according to a new study. The researchers found that 82 per cent of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were vitamin D deficient, while 47 per cent of the control group had the same deficiency. While the researchers reported a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to the control group, they did not find an association between vitamin D levels and the severity of the disease, such as the need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or even death.

> Had to make a trip from Austin to the pan handle of Texas a few weeks ago. Everyone pretty much masked up in Austin. When I got outside of town everyone was looking at me like I was crazy for wearing a mask. It’s unfortunate that the messaging over masks has been so screwed up on all levels of government.
