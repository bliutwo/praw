Officers are issuing them a civil citation for $100," said Miami Police Deputy Chief Ron Papier, "And we're also giving them a mask as well, so they can put it on immediately." Miami Mayor Francis Suarez discussed the mask mandate and the stepped-up enforcement with Fox News Channel on Thursday.

## Fauci tells MarketWatch: I would not get on a plane or eat inside a restaurant

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anthony-fauci-tells-marketwatch-i-would-not-get-on-a-plane-or-eat-inside-a-restaurant-2020-07-24):

> If September looks bad, with flu season approaching and coronavirus is still not under control, isn't January likely to be as bad or even worse for students? Are parents and children facing the possibility of a full year with no in-person schooling? "It's unpredictable. Things could change pretty rapidly. But it doesn't look like we'll be facing a full year with no in-person schooling," Fauci said. Fauci discussed air travel and why he's avoiding it, eating out and why he's avoiding that, the price of a coronavirus vaccine and who should be first in line, the mixed success of mask mandates from Dublin, Ohio to Dublin, Ireland, and lessons from his first pandemic - the HIV/AIDS crisis that eventually killed more than 32 million people worldwide. Larry Kramer, the playwright and activist who once called Fauci a "Murderer" and "Incompetent idiot," ended up a respected and beloved friend of Fauci.
