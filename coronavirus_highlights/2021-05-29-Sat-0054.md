> If people have not yet vaccinated, that's now on them. The science deniers will no longer be able to depend on conscientious, masked people to keep them safe. I hope that's the takeaway from the much needed relaxation of mandates.

## Nearly half of Americans have at least one vaccine shot as Covid case counts fall further

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/covid-19-cases-deaths-vaccinations-daily-update.html):

> About 1.6 million vaccine shots have been reported administered each day on average over the past week, CDC data shows. The seven-day average of daily U.S. Covid cases was 23,033 as of Thursday, down more than 6,000 from a week ago, according to Johns Hopkins data. The latest seven-day average of daily U.S. Covid deaths is 667, JHU data shows, though the release of backlogged data from multiple states in recent days obscures the latest trend.

> about 62.2% of adults have had at least 1 shot too, so 7.8% from hitting that 70% goal

> NEW YORK - As Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported just one coronavirus-related death, the state reported its lowest daily positivity rate since the start of the pandemic. The state reported a statewide positivity rate of 0.59% as of Thursday, the lowest since the crisis began, according to Cuomo. New York City has made great strides in mitigating the COVID-19 spread. About 390 new positive cases and a 0.59% seven-day positivity rate in the city were reported Thursday.

`/u/cancer171` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nn1syk/governor_nyc_reports_1_covid19_death_state_sees/):

> Hawaii and Gov Ige have been doing this since the beginning of time - lowest infection and death rate across 100+ islands and large elderly population. 
> 
> Why are we commending a man, who let our grandmothers die in retirement homes while he sexually harassed young women and promoted his “look at me! How I did it” book (laughable given how much federal help was actually behind NYC’s turnaround).

> California to offer $116M in coronavirus vaccine prize money. Californians will be eligible for $116.5 million in prize money for getting coronavirus shots, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday, a windfall aimed at getting millions of additional Golden State residents vaccinated before the nation's most populous state fully reopens next month. California isn't the first state to offer vaccine prizes, though its pot of money is the largest and so is the most valuable single prize: $1.5 million.
