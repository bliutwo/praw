> Its the same story everywhere.  Even in the USA its remarkable how much the steps taken for COVID-19 has decimated the spread of normal influenza.  It has nothing to do with categorization either; there are actually more tests for influenza a/b this year than previously.
> 
> Here's a comparison between last year and this year for 'regular' influenza on week 47 (a couple weeks back).  In 2019 they tested > 32,000 samples and ended up with more than 2,600 positives for influenza A and B.  This year they tested > 37,000 and ended up with 62.  We're testing more samples and getting less than 1% of the positives.

> It also shows just how much more dangerous COVID-19 is to regular influenza as it continues to spread in these conditions even though influenza has been completely halted in its tracks.

> EDIT: I just changed the 47's in the URLs to 49's to get updated data. Week 49 is still being collected but week 48 should be mostly done. 
> 
> Week 48 was even more stark than week 47.  36 positives this year against well over 3000 last year on almost the same number of tests.  I'm doing this on my phone or I'd give a better analysis.

## Gym defying COVID-19 orders being fined nearly $10K per day

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/1e7e5762087bc5781e8fcd180c351360):

> Owner Michael Knick is operating the business and vows to keep it open, despite the fines which amount to nearly $10,000 per day. The fines issued Friday cover Nov. 30-Dec. 7."He had employees and continued to be open, putting them at risk," Church said Friday. On Dec. 6, Knick posted on social media that employees are no longer working at the gym, which he said Friday means he doesn't fall under L&I's jurisdiction.

> I feel bad for these businesses.  It really is a catch 22.  They are asking them to shut down for good reasons but not helping them out either.  You see countries in Europe are giving businesses 70% of their income from the previous year during shut downs.  Makes it easier to shut down that way.
