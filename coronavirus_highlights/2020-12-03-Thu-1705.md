> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

## Would you be willing to get a Covid vaccine in exchange for a $1,500 stimulus check? How one bold proposal would work

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/03/1500-stimulus-checks-for-covid-19-shots-how-one-plan-would-work.html):

> Tying stimulus checks to vaccinations would actually be the most effective strategy to stop the virus, and thus curtail the need for other forms of aid, Delaney said. The stimulus checks do not necessarily have to be $1,500, Delaney said. More time would also have to be added on in general for the Treasury Department to verify that people have had their vaccines and cross reference that with other requirements they must meet in order to get stimulus checks.

> But, isn’t this vaccine supposed to be available to the public in spring? There has to be some financial help for people between now and then. A lot of people are struggling and can’t wait that long.

## Obama, Bush, Clinton volunteer to get COVID-19 vaccine on camera

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/obama-bush-clinton-volunteer-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-on-camera-651011):

> Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to get the COVID-19 vaccine on camera to promote confidence in the vaccine's safety for the public, CNN reported on Wednesday. Obama told SiriusXM host Joe Madison that, when the vaccine is available, he plans on getting it and may even get it on camera if that will help people to trust it. The possibility that many citizens will refuse to take the vaccine has worried health officials in recent months, although more and more Americans have become willing to accept the vaccine since Pfizer and Moderna released efficacy updates last month.
