> Jesus if you actually read the article you’d see how many people in these comments clearly didn’t and are going off the headline alone. 
> 
> Here’s the full quote of what he actually said, ya know for context:
> 
> “If you want to go the extra mile of safety even though you’re vaccinated when you’re indoors, particularly in crowded places, you might want to consider wearing a mask,” Fauci said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC.
> 
> 
> “It’s suggested that you wear a mask when you are indoors in a situation where you have a level of dynamics of virus in the community that’s high,” Fauci said.
> 
> Here’s what he has to say about a national mandate:
> 
> Despite the surge in new cases, Fauci said he doesn’t believe U.S. officials will renew calls for a nationwide mask mandate “because there will be a lot of pushback on that.”
> 
> And just for fun, here’s his thoughts on any possible lockdowns:
> 
> Fauci said he doesn’t see lockdowns making a comeback anytime soon.
> 
> “I don’t see that on the horizon right now,” Fauci said. “What I do see is increased testing and increased local mandates and a big push to get people vaccinated.”

> This just proves that the lies have taken root so deep that it's almost like we're looking at people who are living a different world from reality. Not going to lie, whenever I see people like this out in the wild, I always wonder what's it like to be so detached from reality, from the world around them. What's it like to not care for other people?

## COVID cases are up 55% across the U.S.

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/covid-pandemic-cases-unvaccinated-vaccines-3d5ac3b0-78fb-473b-ae0b-0f8382d0501b.html):

> The big picture: Some "Breakthrough" infections are happening to vaccinated people, but this rising tide of cases and hospitalizations is mainly a threat to those who aren't vaccinated. "Breakthrough infections" - people who have contracted the virus even after being vaccinated - are getting a lot of attention as cases mount. There will be people in the other 5-6%. That does not mean the vaccines don't work; those cases are noteworthy precisely because they are rare.

`/u/Crott117` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/opaokp/covid_cases_are_up_55_across_the_us/):

> It's of course important to understand the context of some of these increases.  It's very easy to look at a glance and go - "oh look obviously New England is doing bad"
> 
> The actual cases per 100k is very important here (and I wish is was more easily accessible).  Mass is technically up 101% and FL is only up 57% (i used 7/14 vs 7/21 so my numbers are slightly different than theirs)
> 
> HOWEVER
> 
> MA went from 2.4 per 100k to 4.8 per 100k in the last week (7 day daily average per 100k)
> 
> FL went from 24.1 per 100k to 37.7 per 100k in the last week.
