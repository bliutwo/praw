> Saving you a click,
> 
> *"A couple who insisted on having 100 guests for their wedding have contracted coronavirus, alongside eight of their friends.*
> 
> *The wedding, that took place in early July, was held at the SS Peter and Paul’s Church, which overlooks Washington Square Park in San Francisco, California.*
> 
> *The couple* ***also held a rehearsal dinner the night before the event****, which more than 40 guests attended, according to the San Francisco Chronicle."*
> 
> *" As the guests were arriving at the venue, an official from the city showed up and told them that it* ***could not go ahead as planned****, because the amount of guests involved violated an executive order in the state.* 
> 
> *The couple, alongside eight of their guests tested positive for the virus, after they started showing symptoms of Covid-19 within five days of the ceremony.*
> 
> *The guest list at the wedding included* ***people travelling*** *from all over the US, including Texas and Arizona, which have both struggled with the pandemic and recorded record cases in the last six weeks."*
> 
> So 10 people mainly from the rehearsal dinner, would have probably been worse if the Wedding had gone ahead as scheduled.

## Anti-mask US senator who called coronavirus a hoax tests positive for Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jason-rapert-coronavirus-hoax-face-mask-arkansas-asa-hutchinson-a9640156.html):

> An Arkansas senator who shared an article that described the coronavirus pandemic as a "Hoax" has contracted Covid-19. Republican senator Jason Rapert, who unsuccessfully introduced a bill to ban gay marriage in the US in 2017, was hospitalised with coronavirus and pneumonia on 24 July. Although the senator has been pictured wearing a mask previously, he has also been critical of Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson's executive order that made wearing a face covering mandatory in the state when people are outside and when social distancing is not possible.
