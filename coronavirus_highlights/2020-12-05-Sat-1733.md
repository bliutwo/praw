Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/):

> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

## COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in the U.S. this week, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-leading-cause-of-death-united-states-this-week/):

> COVID-19 was ranked as the leading cause of death in the U.S. this week, with 11,820, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In Illinois, the seven-day average death toll is higher than any other state - up nearly 14 percent over two weeks ago, according to the COVID Tracking Project. A new report shows that their trial participants still carried those protective COVID antibodies three months after their second dose.

`/u/plazmablu` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k76mol/covid19_was_the_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us/):

> And this is ONE VIRUS. The other major killers are vague, wide-ranging categories like heart disease, various cancers, and so on. Even the flu isn't a single virus but a number of different ones. This is insane.
