## Fauci worries Thanksgiving may be the start of a dark holiday season if COVID-19 cases continue to soar

> My family gathered from all over the country for Thanksgiving yesterday. When they video called me, they weren’t socially distancing, weren’t wearing masks, and getting ready to eat over the same food. They called me to make fun of me that I was taking the virus seriously. I was “missing out” on my mom’s food (who could end up in the ICU if she catches COVID). Mind you, they believe that somehow they can’t get it from family. Part of me wants them to get the virus as karma, but another part doesn’t because of our healthcare workers and because I don’t actually want them to be sick. I feel bad thinking it, but I’m just so angry and disappointed in them.

## As Americans prepare to gather for Thanksgiving, the world watches with dread and disbelief

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/11/25/covid-world-reaction-us-thanksgiving/):

> Foreign observers are watching with trepidation - and at times disbelief - as coronavirus cases surge across the United States, and scores of Americans are choosing to follow through with plans to visit family and friends for this week's Thanksgiving holiday anyway. Decisions over whether to gather have turned divisive, as experts warn that Thanksgiving includes the key ingredients - a shared, indoor meal and inter-household mixing - that could spark an even worse surge in cases in the coming weeks. Mackay compared large numbers of Americans traveling for Thanksgiving to China's Lunar New Year celebrations in early 2020 that inadvertently helped spread the virus at a crucial early stage.

`/u/SquadronLadder` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k1r8rn/as_americans_prepare_to_gather_for_thanksgiving/):

> The silver lining is that (according to airline data) only 7 million people traveled, when last year 17 million did.
> 
> That’s a 59% drop.
> 
> Over half of Americans are doing what needs to be done. Though I’ll agree far too many are not.

## Evictions have led to hundreds of thousands of additional Covid-19 cases, research finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/evictions-have-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-extra-covid-cases-.html):

> Expiring state eviction bans have led to hundreds of thousands of additional coronavirus cases, new research finds, raising alarm about what will happen when the national eviction moratorium lapses next month. During the pandemic, 43 states, plus Washington D.C., temporarily barred evictions, which at one point estimated the move would displace as many as 40 million people. The researchers, from the University of California Los Angeles, University of California San Francisco, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University and Wake Forest University School of Law, found that lifting state moratoriums and allowing eviction proceedings to continue caused as many as 433,700 excess cases of Covid-19 and 10,700 additional deaths in the U.S. between March and September.

## Hospitals in England told to prepare for Covid vaccine rollout in 10 days' time | Society

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/27/hospitals-england-told-prepare-early-december-covid-vaccine-rollout-nhs):

> Hospitals have been told to prepare for the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine in as little as 10 days' time, with NHS workers expected to be at the front of the queue, the Guardian has learned. NHS bosses said hospitals in England could expect to receive their first deliveries of a vaccine produced by Pfizer/BioNTech as soon as Monday 7 December, with regulatory approval anticipated within days. According to sources at several hospitals across the country, NHS England said they should expect to get stocks of vaccine on 7, 8 or 9 December.

`/u/FatOrangeCat42` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k27afy/hospitals_in_england_told_to_prepare_for_covid/):

> One thing I’m really hoping to see - as a Canadian - is a steady drop off in cases/deaths/hospitalizations and a steady return to normal as the vaccine gets administered to 5 -> 10 -> 20->50 percent of the English/US population over the coming months. Even if we don’t get any vaccines ourselves until March/April (Thanks Trudeau...) just to look at other countries and see a glimpse of the future will be so motivating.
