> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

> On its website, the North Fork Country Club boasts about being the setting of "Peace and relaxation, tranquility and togetherness." But New York state health officials said it was also the backdrop of a COVID-19 "Super-spreader" wedding, at which dozens were infected and more than 100 others were forced to quarantine. Once the U.S. epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic, when new COVID-19 hospitalizations reached nearly 19,000 per day, New York had reduced that figure to just above 400. In recent weeks, hospitalizations in New York rose from 410 on Sept. 5 to 1,444 on Nov. 7, according to the state health department.

> This is the best-case scenario.  Get Fauci, Trump/Pence/Biden/Harris/whatever, Redfield, Pelosi, McConnell, etc. to verifiably receive the vaccine as a vote of confidence.  That would be the way to get the largest number of Americans to buy into it.

Saying he expects it to be within the first 4 months of the year? Really is looking like summer 2021 might be the massive party to end all parties.
