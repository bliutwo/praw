What is the delta variant? Proteins on the outer spikes of the delta variant are "Stickier," making it more transmissible than other variants, said Dr. Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Dallas. Where is the delta variant in Texas? The delta variant has already planted itself in several cities across the state, including Houston and Dallas, according to the Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News.
