Summary of [original article](https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/12/20/news/coronavirus_variante_positivo_in_italia-279229115/?ref=RHTP-BH-I278887413-P1-S4-T1):

> "Il Dipartimento scientifico del Policlinico militare del Celio, che in questa emergenza sta collaborando con l'Istituto superiore della sanità, ha sequenziato il genoma del virus Sars-Cov-2 proveniente da un soggetto risultato positivo con la variante riscontrata nelle ultime settimane in Gran Bretagna". La nuova variante  stata identificata in Gran Bretagna: per la sua rapidità di trasmissione, che sarebbe fino al 70 per cento più elevata del virus finora dominante, il governo britannico ha deciso nella giornata di sabato 19 dicembre una serie di nuove misure di contenimento. Come ha detto il ministro Roberto Speranza, la nuova variante non sarebbe più letale di quella finora conosciuta e i vaccini predisposti contro il coronavirus dovrebbero mantenere la loro efficacia.

> Do they check for mutations in the U.S.? Seems like they should be doing this regularly, but my expectations for what the governments here in the U.S. do have been too high throughout all of this mess.

## 'This is deadly serious' - New coronavirus variant 'out of control', health secretary warns

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-in-tier-4-everybody-needs-to-behave-as-if-they-already-have-coronavirus-matt-hancock-says-12168124):

> The new strain of COVID-19 is out of control and people need to behave as if they already have the virus, especially in the new Tier 4 areas of England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned. Mr Hancock said cases have "Rocketed" during the last few days and warned keeping the new variant under control until a vaccine has been rolled out would be "Very difficult". British Medical Association council chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said the planned five-day Christmas relaxation had not followed the science on the new variant, which he said "Was spreading week-on-week" when the five-day rules were announced by the PM. He told Ridge: "Last Wednesday, before the new variant was announced, it was obvious that the infection was spreading at a dangerous level, the NHS was in a dangerous state."

`/u/AlienApricot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kgstau/this_is_deadly_serious_new_coronavirus_variant/):

> Please be aware - The UK government's advisers believe that this new variant (discovered in September) is more able to transmit than other variants. 
> 
> Whether it is more deadly remains to be seen. 
> The title should, at this stage, not be taken literally, rather as a figure of speech.

> Così il ministro della Salute, Roberto Speranza, ha spiegato la decisione di fermare i voli da e per il Regno Unito dalla mezzanotte di domenica fino al 6 gennaio. "Proteggiamo l'Italia" - Ad annunciare il blocco dei voli  stato il ministro degli Esteri Luigi Di Maio, che su Facebook ha scritto: "Il Regno Unito ha lanciato l'allarme su una nuova forma di Covid che sarebbe il risultato di una mutazione del virus. Come Governo - ha continuato - abbiamo il dovere di proteggere gli italiani, per questa ragione, dopo aver avvisato il Governo inglese, con il Ministero della Salute stiamo per firmare il provvedimento per sospendere i voli con la Gran Bretagna. La nostra priorità  tutelare l'Italia e i nostri connazionali". Ma l'ultimo arrivato in Italia dalla Gran Bretagna dopo lo stop  un Ryanair per Pescara con a bordo 136 passeggeri.

`/u/takatu_topi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kgw1rh/italy_bans_flights_tofrom_uk_effective_immediately/):

> Getting strong February/March vibes here. The bans won't come fast and stringent enough in most places. I'd be willing to wager a princely sum that most European countries already have the new strain, and that they themselves are spreading it to third locations, including the US, right now.
