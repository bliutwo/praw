## NHL suspends Evander Kane for using fake vaccination card

Summary of [original article](https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/nhl-suspends-evander-kane-for-using-fake-vaccination-card/):

> SAN JOSE, Calif. - The NHL has suspended San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane for 21 games for submitting a fake COVID-19 vaccination card. Kane had previously been cleared by the NHL in an investigation into allegations made by Anna Kane that he bet on hockey games, including some against the Sharks. A person familiar with the investigation said earlier this month that the league was looking into allegations that Kane submitted a fake vaccination card.

> This is hilarious. He gave up a job that pays a  $2 million base salary and can get up to $3 million a year over not getting a vaccine and perhaps experience some side effects for a couple of days. The Washington State  football program also isn't doing that terribly and still is in positive territory with wins/ losses so there doesn't seem to be a reason that WSU would have been that eager to be looking for a new coach had he not been idiotic about Covid vaccines.
