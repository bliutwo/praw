> WASHINGTON - Two governors from opposite parties issued warnings Sunday to Americans celebrating the Independence Day holiday as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage across the country, stressing the importance of wearing masks to curb the spread.In an interview with "Meet the Press," Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., whose state saw one of the earlier coronavirus spikes, recounted the "Enormous price" the state has already paid - more than 13,000 dead from the virus. Murphy said Americans should continue to follow public health guidelines but also called for a national strategy that he said is imperative to controlling the virus' spread. The White House has repeatedly deferred to state and local officials, instead offering unenforced guidelines and sending mixed messages on things like masks. While masks were available to attendees, neither masks nor social distancing were required, something Gov. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., lamented on "Meet the Press."

With a line of customers to the door, some waiting outside, online orders dinging on a tablet, the phone ringing off the hook — and then have a customer throw a temper tantrum in the store calling the girls ‘paranoid’ or ‘anti-American’ or even worse – CUSS AT THEM! (Does it feel good to make a 16 year old girl cry in the bathroom? Or sob on her way home from work? Does that make you feel better about Covid? How would you feel if someone did this to your child?)” Mootown Creamery wrote.

We are stressed out, worried, and frustrated. However that is no excuse to take out your frustrations on teenage kids serving ice cream! (Most of which this is their first job!) Are you serious?! What control do they possibly have over the situation?”
