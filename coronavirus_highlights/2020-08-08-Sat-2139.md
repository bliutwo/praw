## Bill Gates is spending $150 million to try to make a coronavirus vaccine as cheap as $3

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/8/21359227/bill-gates-foundation-coronavirus-vaccine-serum-astrazeneca-novavax):

> Gates on Friday said that he and his foundation would spend $150 million to distribute vaccines, if they are found, to some of the world's poorest people. Gates has been among the foremost leaders on vaccine production over the last two decades, spending $4 billion on the global vaccine development effort known as Gavi. Gates is already working with other vaccine researchers - like Johnson & Johnson, which is also pursuing a low-cost vaccine - to secure doses for the developing world.

> This would be excellent but a sizeable faction of the US won't take it because they think random twitter and facebook accounts are far more trustworthy than actually experts on the subject. The silver lining is me and my family shouldn't have a problem getting vaccinated. I may not agree with everything Bill Gates has done in his career but I definitely don't buy into all the stupid stuff floating around. His motivation and goals are far from sinister.

## “Nationwide, 200,700 more people have died than usual from Mar 15 to Jul 25, according to CDC estimates, which adjust current death records to account for typical reporting lags..54,000 higher than the official count of coronavirus deaths for that period.”

`/u/Duncotron` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/i5wqzc/nationwide_200700_more_people_have_died_than/):

> Excess death is really the only way to measure the scale of the impact a pandemic like this has, as it strips out all the argument of cause of death and simply looks at what was likely to be the human toll. 
> 
> The studies we get in the years following the pandemic about the likely mortality numbers and also potential increases in covid related illnesses such as heart and lung disease in survivors are how we can gauge the true impact. 
> 
> This unfortunately does little to quiet those shouting about low death rate and day to day changes. The best we can do in the interim is keep good records and analyse as swiftly as possible in shorter term studies.

> Sadly, I'm sure they won't be able to contact trace this at all, because they will refuse to cooperate and even lie about being there.
