## Tweaking COVID vaccines to fight variants won’t require big trials, FDA says - The regulatory agency is drawing on its experience with annually tweaked flu shots.

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/tweaking-covid-vaccines-to-fight-variants-wont-require-big-trials-fda-says/):

> The FDA emphasized this last point, writing, "To be clear, while we continue to develop an understanding of and address any impact of variants on FDA-regulated products, at this time, available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19.". "We will utilize our experience with influenza to help inform a path forward if SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge against which currently authorized vaccines are not sufficiently effective." Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech have all said they are looking into tweaking their current vaccines to better protect against emerging variants.

## This is shaping up to be the winter nobody got sick – unless you got COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-this-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-winter-nobody-got-sick-unless-you-got/):

> "This is the mildest winter we've had for illness," Ms. O'Dwyer-Manuel says of her family, which includes a baby and a five-year-old who, in prepandemic times, picked up the usual array of viruses at daycare every winter. Over the past four years, his hospital has admitted an average of 234 children every winter for bronchiolitis and pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections frequently touched off by viruses. Extra precautions might not be enough to forestall a rebound of the flu and other viruses next season, said Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist and disease modeller at Princeton University.
