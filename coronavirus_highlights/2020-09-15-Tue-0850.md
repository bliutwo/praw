## Ab8 COVID-19 Drug Breakthrough: Tiny Antibody Component Completely Neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Virus

Summary of [original article](https://scitechdaily.com/ab8-covid-19-drug-breakthrough-tiny-antibody-component-completely-neutralizes-the-sars-cov-2-virus/):

> This antibody component, which is 10 times smaller than a full-sized antibody, has been used to construct a drug - known as Ab8 - for potential use as a therapeutic and prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2. The tiny antibody component is the variable, heavy chain domain of an immunoglobulin, which is a type of antibody found in the blood. In February, Wei Li, Ph.D., assistant director of Pitt's Center for Therapeutic Antibodies and co-lead author of the research, began sifting through large libraries of antibody components made using human blood samples and found multiple therapeutic antibody candidates, including Ab8, in record time.

> According to Diederik Gommers, this is most likely due to better treatments. This would result in less ICU capacity needed for the same number of infections. Also, the survival chances are higher than before. There is no sign of the virus getting less severe.

## If You've Just Had Covid, Exercise Can Cause Serious Complications, Including Heart Disease

Summary of [original article](https://www.wired.com/story/if-youve-just-had-covid-exercise-might-not-be-good-for-you/):

> Evidence is emerging that the virus can cause heart damage even in people who've had mild symptoms or none at all, especially if those people exercise while they're infected. Strenuous activity while the heart is weakened can cause swelling in the legs, dizziness, shortness of breath, and-in serious cases-irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Just last month, former Florida State basketball player Michael Ojo died of apparent heart complications while playing in a pro league in Serbia, shortly after the 27-year-old had recovered from Covid-19.

All four counties had practically returned to pre-summer levels but still account for the majority of hospitalizations in the state.
