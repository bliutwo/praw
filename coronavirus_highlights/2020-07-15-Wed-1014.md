## Arizona student describes "unacceptable" 26-day wait time for COVID-19 test results: "People are dying"

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-arizona-covid-19-test-results/):

> The average wait time for a non-priority patient receiving results on a coronavirus test in Arizona is now seven days, though some, like graduate student Elliot Truslow, are forced to wait nearly a month to hear whether they have the virus as cases balloon in the hard-hit state. Truslow, who studies at the University of Arizona, said they waited 26 days to get their COVID-19 test results. While Arizona is scrambling to build up its testing infrastructure to meet soaring demand, Koeneman admits the week-long wait time for results is a problem.

> A 26 day wait?  That’s insane.  And if you test positive, as an asymptomatic person, that’s a long time to spread it.

## People who social distance may be more intelligent, study says

Summary of [original article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90527258/people-who-social-distance-may-be-more-intelligent-study-says):

> 1 minute Read. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that people who comply with social distancing guidelines have better working memory capacity, which is an indicator of intelligence. The correlation between working memory and social distancing behavior is so strong that individuals' working memory predicts their social distancing behavior-even when controlling for education, moods, personality, and income levels. The aim is to identify why some people do not social distance, and to facilitate strategies to improve overall social distancing compliance.

> Wait wait you're telling me people who intentionally try to limit their exposure to a deadly disease are smarter than people who take absolutely no safety measures?

## 2 Stylists Had Coronavirus, but Wore Masks. 139 Clients Didn’t Fall Sick.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-hair-salon-masks.html?):

> In May, the people interacted with two hair stylists with confirmed coronavirus infections, but none ended up showing symptoms of Covid-19.The team behind the study, which includes members of Missouri's Springfield-Greene County Health Department, cannot be certain of all the factors that helped avert what might otherwise have been a disastrous outbreak. Follow-up interviews with 104 of the clients revealed that, in accordance with guidelines, patrons and stylists alike had worn masks for the duration of almost all the encounters documented by the study. A majority of people in the study, including the two stylists, opted for cloth coverings or surgical masks - loosefitting accessories that don't form an airtight seal around the face.

## As Trump’s rocky relationship with Fauci deteriorates, America’s top infectious disease doctors say: ‘We will not be silenced nor sidelined’

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-trumps-rocky-relationship-with-fauci-deteriorates-americas-top-infectious-disease-doctors-say-we-will-not-be-silenced-nor-sidelined-2020-07-14?mod=newsviewer_click):

> With a rise in COVID-19 cases in most U.S. states, particularly Texas, Arizona, California and Florida, and reversals by some of their plans to reopen, the White House appears to have acknowledged that there is no immediate split in the relationship between Trump and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three decades and a leading expert on pandemics in the U.S. for four decades. Brett Giroir, the testing coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, told NBC's "Meet the Press" that Fauci was not correct in his advice to states to slow down the opening of businesses: "I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right, and he also doesn't necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public-health point of view," Giroir said. On April 13, when reporters questioned Fauci about possible tension between him and the administration, Fauci said he made recommendations to Trump to restrict travel.

> I hope that is true. But the news media tends to stay focused on Trump while all those people he has thrown under the bus in the past, while having valuable things to say, are soon ignored by the media. By now there must be hundreds of these casualties. They are usually silenced and sidelined by the media after Trump ousts them, right?

## Fauci says COVID-19 could reach level of 1918 Spanish flu, the 'mother of all pandemics'

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/fauci-covid-19-level-1918-spanish-flu-mother-all-pandemics-1517867):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert, said on Tuesday we "Can't deny the fact" that the COVID-19 pandemic could reach the level of the Spanish flu, which killed millions of people around the globe between 1918 and 1920. "If you look at the magnitude of the 1918 pandemic where anywhere from 50 to 75 to 100 million people globally died, that was the mother of all pandemics and truly historic. I hope we don't even approach that with [COVID-19] but it does have the makings of, the possibility of approaching that in seriousness," Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said during a Georgetown University Global Health Initiative webinar, according to CNN. There have been more than 13.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the current pandemic, and over 578,000 recorded deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Resource Center. Despite the severity of the pandemic, Fauci also said last week that he was cautiously optimistic a COVID-19 vaccine with some level of effectiveness could be developed by the end of thus year or the beginning of next year.
