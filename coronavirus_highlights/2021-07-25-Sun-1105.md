## Vaccines work, and are safe.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2vtx/vaccines_work_and_are_safe/):

> Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about clotting or growing a third arm. Clotting is rare from the vaccines and common in Covid; clotting as a vaccine side effect is not nearly as common as it seems from media reports, and is mostly in younger people. The vaccines are FREE in the US. FREE FREE, not like "Copay free", like frickin FREE. You don't need insurance.

## Germanys chancellery minster: "vaccinated people will definitely have more freedoms than unvaccinated people. This may also mean that certain offers such as restaurant, cinema and stadium visits would no longer be possible even for tested unvaccinated people because the residual risk is too high."

Summary of [original article](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/freiheiten-geimpfte-kanzleramt-103.html):

> Die Impfung schütze zu 90 Prozent vor einer schweren Corona-Erkrankung. "Daher ist für mich ganz klar: Eltern, Lehrer, Hausmeister und Schulbus-Fahrer müssen sich impfen lassen. Wenn diese Gruppen alle geimpft sind, ist die Gefahr für die Kinder geringer." Das Virus könnte aus seiner Sicht noch einmal genauso gefährlich zurückkommen wie im vergangenen Herbst, als die Infektionszahlen plötzlich drastisch anstiegen.

> As soon as COVID tests won't be paid by the government anymore and people will have to pay for themselves IMHO vaccination rates will rise significantly.

## 80% of vaccinated COVID carriers didn't infect anyone in public spaces -- report

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/80-of-vaccinated-covid-carriers-didnt-spread-virus-in-public-spaces-report/):

> Health Ministry data indicates that 80 percent of vaccinated individuals who recently contracted breakthrough infections of COVID-19 have not infected others in public places, according to a television report on Saturday. Public health chief Sharon Alroy-Preis said on Saturday that officials were debating whether to offer a third booster shot to Israelis, or to wait for a vaccine that is specifically tailored for the Delta variant of the coronavirus. "We are checking if we should give a third dose, or whether we should wait for a vaccine against Delta," the head of public health at the Health Ministry told Channel 12.

> I need to vent.
> Today my girlfriend had her anti-vaxer brother and his family come to town to visit. It would be fine if I was going to dinner or just around them as long as we all had masks on. 
> Well this is where the trouble started. 
> Her brother who "is really careful" just had the plague about 2 weeks ago. He knows how I feel about not getting vaccinated and proceeds to invite himself over to my house. 
> I tell my girlfriend that I don't want them in my place and she goes crazy. We are both vaccinated and she tells me that I'm a idiot because I'm protected and it's his decision not to get the shot. I then tell her that it is my decision not to be around people who don't get the jab and she should respect my decision. 
> Am I wrong?

> It seems that a missing discussion point is the development of therapeutics. Covid will become/is already endemic. If there are going to be seasonal outbreaks of covid, then there needs to be therapeutic treatments to prevent severe illness and death.

## People who believe in science are more likely to wear masks in public to battle COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/people-who-believe-in-science-are-more-likely-to-wear-masks-in-public-to-battle-covid-19-61579):

> Those with a greater belief in science were also more likely to agree with statements such as "Face masks provide protection from the possibility of transmitting COVID-19.". "Our data suggest that people who believe in science broadly more readily acquire knowledge about the importance of engaging in the preventative behavior of mask wearing, and are therefore more likely to partake in this preventative behavior." "We suspect that increasing science education, requiring researchers to participate in open science practices, and encouraging political figures, business leaders, and celebrities to speak more openly and honestly about the importance and impact of scientific findings may contribute to an increase in public trust and belief in science as an institution."

`/u/FlintBlue` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/or8bfk/people_who_believe_in_science_are_more_likely_to/):

> Small point. We don’t “believe in” science. We accept evidence-based findings. Science is not faith-based.
