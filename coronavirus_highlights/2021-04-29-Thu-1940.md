## Flu Has Disappeared Worldwide during the COVID Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic/):

> The U.S. saw about 600 deaths from influenza during the 2020-2021 flu season. Because each year's flu vaccine is based on strains that have been circulating during the past year, it is unclear how next year's vaccine will fare, should the typical patterns of the disease return. The WHO made its flu strain recommendations for vaccines in late February as usual, but they were based on far fewer cases than in a common year.

> But yes, otherwise I was absolutely fine when I got covid... except for being half delirious with fever, coughing so hard it felt like my diaphragm was about to disintegrate... and the curious experience of waking up in the middle of my sleep choking on pink, foaming, blood filled sputum every night for 16 days, trying to decide if it is serious enough to call for an ambulance despite the hospitals being overwhelmed and officials pleading with people not to go to hospital unless it is life-threatening.

## German Intelligence Puts Coronavirus Deniers Under Surveillance

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-deniers-surveillance.html):

> April 28, 2021.BERLIN - Germany's domestic intelligence service said on Wednesday that it would surveil members of the increasingly aggressive coronavirus denier movement because they posed a risk of undermining the state. The movement - fueled in part by wild conspiracy theories - has grown from criticizing coronavirus lockdown measures and hygiene rules to targeting the state itself, its leaders, businesses, the press and globalism, to name a few. "Our basic democratic order, as well as state institutions such as parliaments and governments, have faced multiple attacks since the beginning of the measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic," the Interior Ministry said in a statement confirming that parts of the denier movement would be under observation.
