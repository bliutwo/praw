## Let’s gather this holiday season and collect the one good thing this year brought us. That’s right, COVID memes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/):

> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

## Bryan Cranston says he still hasn’t recovered sense of taste or smell after coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bryan-cranston-coronavirus-taste-smell-recovery-b1766673.html):

> Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston has revealed that he has still not fully recovered his sense of taste or smell after contracting coronavirus. Appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Cranston has now said that the only symptom that lingered is that "I have lost a percentage of my ability to taste and smell". He said of his sense of taste and smell: "I think about 75 percent has come back, but if someone was brewing coffee and I walk into a kitchen, I cannot smell it," he said.

> As several people have pointed out when reporting this post, the headline is misleading; Mr. Cranston indicated that he has recovered approximately 75% of these senses. Thank you to those who brought that to our attention.

> And this is ONE VIRUS. The other major killers are vague, wide-ranging categories like heart disease, various cancers, and so on. Even the flu isn't a single virus but a number of different ones. This is insane.
