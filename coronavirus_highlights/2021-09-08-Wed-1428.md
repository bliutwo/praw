## Misinformation is bad. Good information is good.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/):

> Here are some good sources of information about COVID-19 that are written to be accessible to the general public. For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

> The moderators of this sub support efforts to more strongly combat COVID-19 misinformation on Reddit. We believe our sub is one of the best places on Reddit, and maybe the internet, to get accurate and timely information on the pandemic, and we take a strong stance against misinformation. In our opinion, it would be counterproductive to make one of the most accurate subs on Reddit private in order to combat misinformation on Reddit. If you would like to discuss the current happenings in regards to subs going private, please do so on this sticky. Feel free to share this post with others who are seeking accurate information. All other meta-drama comments will be removed. Thanks!

## ‘Joe Rogan Is Getting This Completely Wrong,’ Says The Scientist Who Conducted The Vaccine Study

> This post had been locked as the comments are veering off topic - we hear you loud and clear folks, Joe is not a scientist! The article is fact checking one of Joe Rogans claims about “leaky” vaccines. 
> 
> Andrew Read is a professor of biology and entomology at Pennsylvania State. His 2015 vaccine study was misrepresented by Joe Rogan and has since gone viral. 
> 
> “Read responds: “We're talking a very different virus and very different vaccines. The details in biology really matter a lot. The chicken vaccines we worked with, the first-generation vaccine, definitely reduced disease, severity and death.” But unlike the COVID mRNA vaccines, the chicken vaccine “didn't stop transmission at all.” And this is one of the key differences between what was being studied in Read’s paper and our current situation with the global pandemic. “Those [vaccinated] chickens just kept churning out the virus for weeks and weeks and weeks.” Again, this is a key difference. “It’s a very different virus from SARS-2. A key issue here is transmissibility.”
> 
> More transmission increases the likelihood of mutation. Thankfully, COVID-19 Vaccines reduce transmission and reduce opportunity for mutation.
> 
> “Think about what's happening with evolution,” offers Read. “Mutations can occur anytime the [virus] replicates. So the more replication, the more variants are generated. At the moment, the vast majority of the replication is happening in unvaccinated people. You can tell that because the majority of cases in the hospital are unvaccinated individuals. That is where the evolutionary action is happening at the moment.” 
> 
> Are mRNA vaccines ‘leaky’?
> 
> Rogan seems to think that mRNA vaccines are quite leaky because of breakthrough infections. Read points out that no vaccine is 100% effective. Although we still need more data to determine how leaky they are, the rate of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people remains statistically low enough to consider the mRNA vaccines highly effective at preventing infection.
> 
> “We don't know at the moment how leaky these things are. It's conceivable that they are actually close to non-leaky. I'm amazed how good these mRNA vaccines are. They're incredibly good.”
> 
> Read’s very concerned that misrepresentation of his research is causing vaccine hesitancy.
> 
> “The study was tweeted a thousand times last night, according to our metrics,” says Read. “I had a physician in England reach out to me on Friday asking me to [clarify] because his patients are using my paper to argue against vaccination.” Calling into question the effectiveness of vaccines was never the intention of his 2015 study. “I am genuinely shocked. I've been doing work for 20 years now on how vaccines might drive the evolution of viruses. There's nothing in any of that 20 years work that argues in favor of withholding lifesaving vaccines. It's just shocking to me.” He adds, “There are 600,000 Americans dead so far. The vast majority of those deaths are vaccine-preventable. There's not a single scenario that would argue in favor of not using [vaccines] to save the next hundred thousand. Not one scenario.”

## 3 Vermont state troopers resign after alleged fake covid vaccination card scheme

`/u/rabbidrascal` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbyip/3_vermont_state_troopers_resign_after_alleged/):

> Those three lost a pretty sweet gig.
> 
> Vermont is drowning under its pension obligations. The top pension recipients are Judges and State Troopers. State troopers retire at 50, with a pension that is 50% of their top 2 years salary. If they don't get promoted ever, that's a 50k lifetime pension starting at 50 years old. If you do a good job and get promoted, you can retire with more than double that. Based on the pensions VT currently pays, many troopers retire young and with significant pensions.
> 
> On top of that, despite all the thin blue line bullshit, VT state trooper is a very safe job. They rarely die on the job, and if they do, it's because they crash their cruiser, not because they got shot. It's far safer than, say, farming in Vermont.
> 
> Lot's of law enforcement jobs are actually quite safe, and offer great benefit packages. VT State Trooper is certainly an example of that.

> 
> For the record, I have always been incredibly regular my entire menstruating life. For me to be weeks early is not something that’s happened before.
> 
> It only happened the once and then was back to normal. I had a strong reaction to dose 2 that knocked me on my ass for 4 days, so I figured the stress my body was under kicked my period into starting early.

> I can relate. I have nonverbal autistic twins with chronic lung issues. Can't afford to catch Covid and can't understand how to protect themselves, so our only option is to keep them home until they can get vaccinated. Sadly, their development has suffered, but at least they are safe.
