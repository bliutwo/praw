> Microsoft founder Bill Gates blamed social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter for the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 during the pandemic. "Can the social media companies be more helpful on these issues? What creativity do we have? Sadly, the digital tools probably have been a net contributor to spreading what I consider crazy ideas," Gates said in an interview with American business magazine Fast Company. "We need to make it [a vaccine] without just focusing on one country, we need to make it for the entire world, including for countries that don't have the resources to pay for vaccine research or vaccine factories," said Gates.

NEW - Kim Guilfoyle, girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. and a top campaign official, tested positive for coronavirus in SD ahead of attending Mt Rushmore event, according to a person familiar w what happened. The positive test from someone deep within Trump's personal inner circle presents an embarrassing and inconvenient contradiction for Trump, who earlier this week downplayed the pandemic and said it would "Just disappear" and it comes amid a massive spike in Covid-19 cases across dozens of states that fueled the country to a single-day record of more than 55,000 new coronavirus cases.

## Rick Wilson Mocks Administration's Covid Response: Like Roosevelt Dismissing Pearl Harbor Attacks, Saying Japanese Will ‘Just Go Away Tomorrow’

Summary of [original article](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/rick-wilson-mocks-trump-covid-response-like-roosevelt-dismissing-pearl-harbor-attacks-saying-japanese-will-just-go-away-tomorrow/):

> Former Republican strategist and Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson mocked President Donald Trump's Covid-19 response, analogizing it to President Franklin Roosevelt ignoring Japanese attacks after Pearl Harbor and expecting them to "Just go away tomorrow." "Donald Trump every day continues to believe things like 'It's just going to disappear,'" Wilson continued. The president, who has never publicly been seen wearing a face mask, recently said he's "All for masks." "I don't know if you need 'mandatory' because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance," Trump said on Wednesday.
