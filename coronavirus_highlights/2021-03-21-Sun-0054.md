Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56454701):

> Protecting themselves for a shift on the Covid ward is a process the medics at Perm Regional Hospital have fine-tuned over months of practice. "In Covid, you choose between the economy and people's lives - mostly older people's lives," is how Alexei sees the government's rationale. Perm Regional hospital hasn't stopped admitting Covid cases, though.

`/u/akirodic` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/m96xqw/excess_deaths_in_russia_suggest_covid_death_toll/):

> Same issue is observed in Serbia. The official count of deaths is significantly lower than the rise of average death toll. Moreover the daily distribution of covid-19 deaths is statistically impossible.

> This is what happens when data is not open to public and governments decide how many people died from covid-19.

Minnesota over the past week has seen a slight increase in infection numbers, the positivity rate of diagnostic testing, and hospitalizations. Vaccine access continues to broaden, with the state adding another permanent vaccination site in St. Cloud and distributing more doses to pharmacies and clinics across Minnesota.

`/u/Knows-something` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/m9oa9o/minnesota_nears_80_covid19_vaccination_rate_in/):

> Shall we guess their political leanings based on their acceptance of the vax?  Like in Ireland, drank the soup, or didn't.   It's so difficult to be objective and honest.  This seems to be such an aberration from what we understand.  Bully for them.  Wishing them 10% more or even higher.
