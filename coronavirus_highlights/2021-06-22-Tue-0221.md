I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-reports-53256-new-covid-19-cases-2021-06-21/):

> BENGALURU, June 21 - India gave out a record 7.5 million vaccine doses on Monday under a federal campaign to inoculate all adults for free after weeks of criticism that a chaotic rollout had worsened a second wave that killed hundreds of thousands. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government would buy 75% of all vaccines from drug makers and distribute them for free to states, which along with private hospitals had earlier been buying shots for people aged 18-45.India's previous record of 4.5 million doses was on April 5, followed by a sharp decline with average daily inoculation falling below 3 million. "If supply remains consistent, we will be on course to innoculate most of our population by the end of the year, D N Patil, a senior health official in the country's richest state of Maharashtra, told Reuters.Maharashtra has a population of more than 125 million.Earlier this month, the government said India could have as many as 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines available per day in July and August.Government adviser Vinod Kumar Paul said on Monday that administering 10 million shots per day was not a"set goal".

## WHO says Delta is the fastest and fittest Covid variant and will ‘pick off’ most vulnerable

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/covid-delta-who-says-variant-is-the-fastest-and-fittest-and-will-pick-off-most-vulnerable-.html):

> The highly contagious delta variant is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain yet, and it will "Pick off" the most vulnerable people, especially in places with low Covid-19 vaccination rates, World Health Organization officials warned Monday. A variant can be labeled as "Of concern" if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments, according to the health organization. The delta variant now makes up more than 60% of new cases in the U.K. WHO officials have said there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions.

## 25% of young adults most likely won't get COVID-19 vaccine, CDC survey shows

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/06/21/coronavirus-vaccine-refusal-cdc/3141624285738/):

> June 21 - One in four adults age 18 to 39 in the United States "Probably or definitely" will refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to survey data released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Through Monday, 65% of U.S. adults age 18 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, though just under 56% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. In April, the U.S. was vaccinating about 5% of its adult population each week, and that figure was well under 2% by mid-May. "Despite expanded eligibility to all adults in the United States by April 19, vaccine initiation among persons aged 65 years has not increased at the same rate observed in earlier periods among persons aged 65 years [and older]," the CDC researchers wrote.

> I thought younger people would have been more willing to get the vaccine.

>  I still don't understand why someone wouldn't want to take vaccine that prevents them from getting sick.  Facebook is truly a terrible resource.

## For the first time since the pandemic started, Maryland reported no covid deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/zero-covid-deaths-maryland-dc/2021/06/21/7e4e6512-d2a6-11eb-ae54-515e2f63d37d_story.html):

> Both the District and Maryland reported no new deaths for two days in a row this week, although Virginia is still reporting at least one death per day and as many as 14 one day last week. Lilian Peake, the state epidemiologist for Virginia, cautioned against reading too much into day-to-day reporting of deaths because the numbers reflect deaths that have happened in the past, not necessarily what is happening with the pandemic in real time. In the national ranking of cases per 100,000 residents, in the week ended June 10, Maryland had the sixth fewest cases; Virginia ranked seventh, and the District ranked 11th.For deaths per 100,000 residents, in the same week, Virginia had the 27th fewest deaths; Maryland ranked 29th. D.C. had the third fewest deaths, the CDC data shows.
