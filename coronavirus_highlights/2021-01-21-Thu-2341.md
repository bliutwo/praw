## Biden signs order requiring masks on planes, buses, trains and at airports

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/biden-mask-mandate/2021/01/21/5867d7ee-5bf9-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html):

> President Biden signed an order Thursday mandating masks in airports and on many planes, trains, ships and intercity buses. Together, the two orders come as close to a national mask mandate as his federal powers may allow, leaving it to states and municipalities to require residents to wear masks at a local level. Biden had said before his inauguration he would require masks for "Interstate travel on planes, trains and buses," and CDC officials had indicated that interstate travel is where their existing authority lies.
