In May, a Dallas fire marshal shut down the crowded Harris House of Heroes location off McKinney Avenue after a disagreement over whether it should be classified as a bar or restaurant. Police said the shooter went to the back of the sports bar, where he was "Confronted by armed partrons," and they exchanged gunfire.
