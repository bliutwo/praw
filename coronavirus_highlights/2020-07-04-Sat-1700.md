> Microsoft founder Bill Gates blamed social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter for the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 during the pandemic. "Can the social media companies be more helpful on these issues? What creativity do we have? Sadly, the digital tools probably have been a net contributor to spreading what I consider crazy ideas," Gates said in an interview with American business magazine Fast Company. "We need to make it [a vaccine] without just focusing on one country, we need to make it for the entire world, including for countries that don't have the resources to pay for vaccine research or vaccine factories," said Gates.

> Nothing surprises me anymore. Literally people vote to have their rights removed and rejoice to it, love it, and won't see the fact of what they are doing.
> 
> Same as people choosing to danger themselves and others by fighting against the social distancing measures as if wearing a mask will some how damage your rights.
> 
> Social media has a lot to answer for.

## Lake Tahoe (California) expecting 77,000 visitors over 4th of July weekend

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/tahoe-expecting-77000-visitors-over-fourth-of-july-weekend/103-51bf3b02-a702-4533-a7b0-02e0b44d4327?repost):

> Calif. - Tahoe draws millions of visitors from around the world year-round, especially during the Fourth of July, one of the hottest weekends for Tahoe tourism. "Our population is about 23,000 full-time residents and we'll probably see close to 100,000 people in South Lake Tahoe this weekend," said South Lake Tahoe Mayor Collin. Having visitors is a fine line for the Tahoe region, as they want to maintain their economy's health - which heavily relies on tourism - while also protecting the physical health of residents and visitors alike.

> Please upvote this post, we need some attention. I am a full-time resident of Lake Tahoe (there aren't many of us, ~19,000) and we have been completely abandoned by local and state governments. The past three weekends have been insane, and I have been in genuine shock at the amount of people coming here. Every single casino, bar, restaurant, hotel is open, and while they all say "masks required" I would say maybe 1 in 100 are wearing masks. There are huge crowds at every beach, worse than those photos of Lake of the Ozarks, but on a massive scale. And, again, NO ONE is wearing masks.
> 
> We will never know how much COVID impacted Lake Tahoe. People will be coming here, getting sick, going home, and getting tested in their home communities. High profile tourist restaurants have had employees testing positive after reporting "thousands" of patrons served in a single day, and that was weeks ago, not even 4th of July. 
> 
> In Gov. Newsom's plan to close restaurants etc. in 19 counties yesterday, we were not on it, despite having insane tourist numbers. Our mayor, Jason Collin, rolled over for business owners like a coward.

## Researchers find fans of apocalyptic movies may be coping with pandemic better

Summary of [original article](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-fans-apocalyptic-movies-coping-pandemic.html):

> A small team of researchers from the University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, and Aarhus University has found that people who are exposed to end-of-the-world movies may be more resilient when dealing with the real-life ongoing pandemic. To find out why, and whether watching the movie helped viewers, the researchers turned to Prolific-an online recruitment tool that allows researchers to connect with volunteers virtually. The researchers found that people who had recently watched what they describe as "Prepper" movies showed signs of higher levels of resilience to the real-world pandemic.

`/u/tahlyn` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hl9951/researchers_find_fans_of_apocalyptic_movies_may/):

> I mean... it kinda makes sense.  If you are emotionally and mentally desensitized to the idea of end-of-days scenarios, or if you have a cynical/realistic understanding of how things could be so much worse... the current pandemic is a lot like "a boring dystopia."  It's easy mode.
> 
> Instead of a zombie plague where we all fight  for our lives against a violent horde with total societal collapse... a nuclear war where humanity will die out from nuclear winter... a world war where we're asked to all become Rosie the Riveter in a wartime manufacturing effort... catastrophic climate change leading to mass crop failure and worldwide starvation and untenable heat...
> 
> All our governments asked us to do for the end of days was to *just stay home.* Our apocalypse: watching movies, playing video games, ordering carryout, spending time with our families.  *The horror*!
> 
> In the proper perspective, a perspective honed from horror movies of how it could (realistically or not) be so much worse, this really isn't that bad.

## NY partygoers get subpoenas after stonewalling COVID-19 contact tracers

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/ny-partygoers-get-subpoenas-after-stonewalling-covid-19-contact-tracers/):

> In New York, public health officials are struggling to convince some residents to work with contact tracers as a new cluster threatens to turn into a flare-up. Contact tracing in general has been a struggle in the US. Several cities and states have reported difficulty in contacting people and convincing them to help trace the virus. For the people who were at the earlier party: "We're asking them nicely now,"Day said, "They'll be getting subpoenas later."

> If we can't even get people to consistently wear masks, what makes anyone think we will be able to get adequate contact tracing from same population?  I guess mandatory mask laws and subpoenas it is....
