## White House seeks to block funds for coronavirus testing and tracing in relief bill, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/18/white-house-seeks-to-block-funds-for-testing-in-coronavirus-relief-bill-report.html):

> The White House is trying to block billions of dollars for coronavirus testing and contact tracing in the upcoming stimulus relief bill, according to a new report in The Washington Post, even as infections surge across the country and Americans face long wait times to receive test results amid high demand. President Trump has publicly called coronavirus testing a "Double-edged sword" and even suggested at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that officials should slow testing down. The Times report portrayed a president who feels boxed in by testing because cases counts inevitably increase as more people are tested, jeopardizing the reopening of the economy and potentially damaging his re-election chances.

## Fauci holds up New York as model for fighting coronavirus — 'They did it correctly'

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/18/fauci-holds-up-new-york-as-model-for-fighting-coronavirus-they-did-it-correctly.html):

> Less than 1% of New Yorkers tested for the virus were positive Thursday, down from a high of more than 40%. Gov. Andrew Cuomo instituted some of the strictest reopening requirements in the country, insisting that stay-at-home orders remain in place and many businesses remain closed far longer than states that are now seeing surges such as Texas and Florida. More than 400,000 New Yorkers have been infected by the virus since the pandemic began and at least 32,463 people have died in the state. Last Sunday, Florida reported more than 15,000 new infections, more than New York during the peak of its outbreak.

> The real problem is, other states almost learned nothing from New York.

## Fauci: Young people are "propagating the pandemic" by "not caring"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/fauci-young-people-coronavirus-surge-49f057f9-3662-4588-b3f2-b624e7a4644f.html):

> Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with WebMD's chief medical officer on Saturday that young people are driving the uptick in coronavirus cases by "Not caring" whether they get infected. "Because by allowing yourself to getting infected or not caring if you do get infected, you are propagating a pandemic. Because it doesn't end with you. You get infected and have no symptoms. The chances are you're going to infect someone else, who will then infect someone else." "And then someone who's vulnerable to severe consequences will get infected. That could be father, mother, or grandmother. It could be a sick child who's an immunodeficient child. It could be a woman who's on chemotherapy for breast cancer."

> The problem is not also in the US. 
> I noted it in Italy too.
> Too much adolescents are not caring about it.

## Older Children Spread the Coronavirus Just as Much as Adults, Large Study Finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html):

> The researchers traced the contacts only of children who felt ill, so it's still unclear how efficiently asymptomatic children spread the virus, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "The questions about the role of children are more around whether children who don't have symptoms are infectious." These older children are frequently as big as adults, and yet may have some of the same unhygienic habits as young children do.
