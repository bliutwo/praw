## Soldier who called on troops to refuse vaccine distribution faces mutiny related charge

Summary of [original article](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/soldier-who-called-on-troops-to-refuse-vaccine-distribution-faces-mutiny-related-charge/):

> A soldier who called on his fellow military personnel to refuse helping with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been charged with an offence related to mutiny. Kenderesi, who had a civilian hunting knife strapped to his Canadian Forces uniform and was carrying a non-Canadian helmet, questioned the safety of the vaccine. Ottawa lawyer Michel Drapeau said the laying of a charge related to mutiny is unheard of in the Canadian Forces in modern times.

> In Germany, he would already face charges for being in uniform at a rally: ["The soldier must not wear uniform at political events."](https://www.buzer.de/gesetz/2246/a31651.htm) Is there a similar law in Canada?

## Why it’s time to stop wiping down groceries and other COVID-19 cleaning measures that don’t reduce transmission risk

Summary of [original article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-should-we-stop-wiping-down-the-groceries-its-time-to-cut-covid-19/):

> Experts say that it's time to move past "Hygiene theatre" - or cleaning behaviours that give people a sense of security and protection, but are actually unlikely to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission. The environmental impact of disposable wipes, the cost of disinfecting supplies, and the burden on restaurant and retail employees to maintain strict COVID-19 cleaning measures, are further reasons to start being pragmatic - and stop wiping down groceries and mail. Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said that in public spaces and community settings outside of households, the risk of surface transmission is relatively low and can "Easily be addressed through conventional cleaning - without deep cleaning, deep disinfection, and [by using] hand disinfectant."

> I know the article is about groceries but wiping down gym equipment has always been common practice. As a pre-covid gym user I hope people don't forget that

## Wisconsin Catholic pastor who preached against Covid-19 vaccine ordered to step down

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wisconsin-catholic-pastor-who-preached-against-covid-19-vaccine-ordered-n1268352):

> The pastor of a Roman Catholic parish in Wisconsin who told his congregation to shun the Covid-19 vaccine and preached right-wing politics from the pulpit has been asked to step down by his bishop. The Rev. James Altman, of the St. James the Less Roman Catholic Church in La Crosse, made the announcement during his sermon at Sunday Mass, calling himself a victim of the "Cancel culture." In an earlier interview, Catholic theologian Jason Steidl said Callahan does have the power to oust an "Alt-right priest" like Altman but risks antagonizing the ultraconservative parishioners who are drawn to his message.
