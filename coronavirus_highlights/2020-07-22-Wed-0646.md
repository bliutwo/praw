> My co worker just told me his buddy tested positive. Got his results 13 days after he tested. In the time in between he still had to go to work like nothing was going on. By the time he got his results he was over it already and had to keep working. This shit is fucked man. I just assume anywhere I go people have it, and I stay the fuck away from anyone.

## LabCorp CEO says coronavirus in U.S. is spreading faster than it can add testing capacity

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/labcorp-ceo-coronavirus-is-spreading-faster-than-testing-expansion.html):

> Testing for Covid-19 in the U.S. has been beset by challenges since the early days of the pandemic, including strains on the supply chain. In the last 7 days, the U.S. has averaged nearly 763,000 diagnostic tests per day, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Covid Tracking Project. The national average in April was about 174,000 diagnostic tests per day, per a CNBC analysis.

> See, that's the thing, a couple of months ago people were saying we'd need at least half a million tests a day in the US. That was because they didn't anticipate the virus surging in so many places at once, the experts assumes that we would learn after NYC.

## Narcissistic personalities linked to defiance of coronavirus prevention guidelines and hoarding

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/07/narcissistic-personalities-linked-to-defiance-of-coronavirus-prevention-guidelines-and-hoarding-57230):

> "Collective narcissists do not engage less in preventive behaviors, while dark triad personalities do. Dark personalities engage less in prevention only because they do not believe in the utility of preventative measures. They do not believe in effectiveness of such behaviors and they see more barriers to adopt them," Zemojtel-Piotrowska said. "So being 'dark' is important for behaviors during the pandemic, but 'dark' people engage in hoarding mostly because of their personality, while their preventative behaviors are conditioned by their beliefs about the coronavirus." "We do not know why exactly people with dark personalities tend to buy more supplies - because they are more greedy or they are more competitive than others or they more take care about their personal comfort due to their feelings of entitlement."

## 94-year-old 'Rosie the Riveter' once made warplanes and red bandannas. Now she makes face masks with the same cloth

Summary of [original article](https://www.inforum.com/newsmd/coronavirus/6583530-94-year-old-North-Dakota-native-Rosie-the-Riveter-once-made-warplanes-and-red-bandannas.-Now-she-makes-face-masks-with-the-same-cloth):

> For many years, Krier has paid tribute to her beloved Rosie the Riveters by making red bandannas with white polka dots - a style shown in J. Howard Miller's iconic Rosie the Riveter "We Can Do It!" poster for Westinghouse Electric. Since the war against the novel coronavirus started, Krier shifted her energy from making Rosie bandannas to Rosie face masks, cut from the same cotton cloth. Krier, a great-great-grandmother, makes the masks as gifts for people who request them - including teachers, who said they will gladly wear the masks in the classroom and explain to students the history of their foremothers.

> Where’s school? Meets all the risk index criteria and is most similar to probably a theater situation or church? But yeah, let’s just get the 20-21 year rolling like NBD.
