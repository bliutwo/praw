## J&J Covid-19 Vaccine Was 66% Effective in Late-Stage Study

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-j-covid-19-vaccine-was-66-effective-in-late-stage-study-11611925201):

> "The availability of the J&J vaccine will be a terrific asset," said William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University who serves as a liaison to a federal vaccine advisory committee. The U.S. government agreed last year to buy 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine for $1 billion, or $10 a dose, and provided $456 million of additional funding for clinical trials and other vaccine development activities at J&J. The government, which has options to acquire additional doses, would oversee the allocation and distribution of the J&J vaccine, which will be free to anyone who receives it. In late October, the company decided to resume the large U.S.-based study after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the illness.

> The good side of this being a less effective vaccine is that it suggests that mRNA vaccines just slap. 
> 
> If this was equally effective it would suggest that the high effectiveness of Pfizer/Moderna is due to the coronavirus itself rather than the new technology. But this and Astrazeneca suggest that mRNA vaccines are genuinely an improvement and could conceivably be used to improve the world in all sorts of other ways in the near future.
> 
> EDIT: Just editing this to mention some responses have some good points about the new variants and single dose regime being potential confounding factors.

> 1 shot, and you don’t die. That should be the focus, that’s enough to get this out there ASAP, we’ll figure out logistics and booster shots along the way.

## Tyler Perry Gets Covid-19 Vaccine on TV to Reassure Black Skeptics

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/arts/tyler-perry-reassures-vaccine-skeptics.html):

> In 1956, at the behest of health officials, Elvis Presley received his polio vaccine in front of press photographers backstage at "The Ed Sullivan Show" to help overcome public suspicion about the vaccine. Skepticism about the Covid-19 vaccine among Black people has been deeply concerning to health officials. A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in three Black people was hesitant about vaccine - making them one of the groups most reluctant to get it, along with Republicans, rural residents and people in their 30s and 40s. A recent CNN analysis found that Black and Latino Americans were getting the vaccine at significantly lower rates than white people.

> All the support staff of hospitals go unnoticed and unappreciated, even before the pandemic. It's not just the value of their primary duties.
> 
> Both my father and sister went through prolonged and uncertain hospital stays. In both cases, the support staff would show genuine caring. My father, a physician, remarked that even brief conversations with non-medical employees were sometimes the only time he'd have conversations completely free of his condition. They gave him a chance to feel free of his leukemia, if only for a few moments. He was more than a little embarrassed that even working in the same building, he'd never noticed or appreciated it before.
