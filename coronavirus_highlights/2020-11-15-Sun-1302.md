> In an attempt to rejuvenate the Daily Discussion thread, users have requested that a section for frequently asked questions be added. I've actually been wanting to do this for a while, so I'm excited to see there's an interest. I can tell you how an mRNA vaccine works, but I can't tell you how vaccine development will go.

## The impact of a new Covid vaccine will kick in significantly over summer and life should be back to normal by next winter, one of its creators has said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54949799):

> Last week, BioNTech and co-developers Pfizer said preliminary analysis showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. In an interview on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Prof Sahin said he was confident the vaccine would reduce transmission between people as well as stop symptoms developing in someone who has had the vaccine. Asked if the vaccine was as effective in older people as it is in younger people, he said he expected to have a better idea in the next three weeks.

> Fauci is an expert. I trust him far more than any redditor dipshit who "well actually"s the transition. This doctor has been around for multiple presidents.

> Stop thinking that just because a thought is contrary that it's valid.

## Study: Temperature checks, symptom screenings not very effective in detecting COVID-19 infections

Summary of [original article](https://abc13.com/temperature-checks-covid-coronavirus-symptoms-screenings/7922615/):

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/pluscell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ju9roi/study_temperature_checks_symptom_screenings_not/):

> I work in a place that has a couple thousand people come in every day, I'd guess.  We've been getting temperature screened every time we come in since probably July or August.  I recently found out that no one has ***ever*** been turned away (101+).  I guess it's okay in that it's telling people "Yo if you feel warm, don't even bother coming in", but it also seems like a waste of time and resources.
> 
> We've had 19 cases in total, also, so it's never caught them.

## London to be locked down until at least Spring

> The email refers to Tier 2 restrictions, which would not entail the closure of non-essential shops or outdoors dining or drinking. Lockdown is not an accurate term. Besides, the publication seems rather biased, but someone from the UK might have a more informed opinion about that.

## Fauci Says Pfizer Vaccineâ€™s Trial Success May Boost Acceptance

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/IanMazgelis` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/junqkk/fauci_says_pfizer_vaccines_trial_success_may/):

> Most people I talk to about the vaccine think it'll be fine, but the one thing I hear brought up in every conversation is long term side effects. Which, despite what people on this subreddit keep saying, is a pretty understandable concern. I think health officials need to start talking about that conversation seriously, because right now normal people who might be on the fence about this don't really have a means to learn more about it without being treated like a conspiracy theorist.
> 
> mRNA vaccines are very new. Most people don't even know what mRNA is and have as much reason to believe claims that it's safer than a conventional vaccine as they do to believe it's more dangerous than a conventional vaccine. It's important that these things are actually explained beyond the scope of "Do what you're told," because when there's a vacuum of information it's quickly filled with misinformation. Sometimes it seems to me like Fauci doesn't consider that, which is upsetting to me. He's a brilliant man but he seems to have a hard time with the human element, even if that's something I think we can all relate to. He talks a lot about messaging, but so far his idea of messaging seems to be reiterating that the vaccine is safe without explaining *why* it's safe and why the claims that it isn't don't make sense. That's bad messaging and it's arguably making the situation worse.
> 
> It's a big, huge problem that every time I see someone simply ask a *question* about vaccine safety on Reddit, they're absolutely dog piled with people accusing them of "Spreading conspiracy theories" and insisting they must "think Bill Gates is trying to chip" them. Maybe this stuff is funny to joke about with your friends, but if you're a normal person who doesn't really understand it, and reaching out for information gets people *furious* at you, it's not exactly conducive to the learning process, and I might even go as far as to say I can understand how someone might become even more of a vaccine skeptic after reading some of the comments made by vaccine supporters on this subreddit.
