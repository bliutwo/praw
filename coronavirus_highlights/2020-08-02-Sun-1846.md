## Dr. Fauci Says Early Results from Coronavirus Vaccine Are 'Very Good News'

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/health/phase-1-results-in-experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-prove-promising/):

> The experimental coronavirus vaccine was "Generally well tolerated and prompted neutralizing antibody activity in healthy adults," according to Phase 1 findings. Early test results from a prospective novel coronavirus vaccine could be a positive sign, researchers say, and Dr. Anthony Fauci calls the Phase 1 trial "Very good news." Dr. Fauci pointed out that "The companies, both Moderna and other companies that are involved with the development of vaccines, promise that as we get into 2021, there'll be an ample supply because they're going to start making the doses imminently. By the beginning of the year we should have the first tens of millions and then hundreds of millions of doses. That being the case, I would think we could vaccinate a substantial portion of the population as we get into 2021 - if the vaccine is safe and effective."

> Half of the participants reported “fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia or pain at the injection site”. The operative word there is *or*..  they did not report *all* of those listed side effects. Regardless, pain at the injection site is very common with nearly every existing vaccine as are most of the other side effects reported here. I will gladly roll the dice any day with the chance of having a headache or a sore arm for possible protection against COVID.

## Yale Epidemiologist pens letter denouncing White House attacks on Anthony Fauci

Summary of [original article](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/07/31/yale-epidemiologist-pens-letter-denouncing-white-house-attacks-on-anthony-fauci/):

> The letter defends Anthony Fauci - Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - and his evidence-based approach to combating COVID-19. The letter refers to a campaign waged by the White House to discredit Fauci. In a July 9 interview, President Trump told Fox News Host Sean Hannity that Fauci had "Made a lot of mistakes." A recent White House document released to the press portrayed some of Fauci's early statements about the pandemic as inaccurate.

> Cue the Anti - Yale tweets from the ministry of Orange.  Maybe a reduction in Research grants to Yale?

## White House opposes requirement for passengers to wear masks on planes, trains

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airlines-idUSKCN24V3NC):

> WASHINGTON - The White House on Thursday said it opposed language in a bill before Congress that would require airline, train and public transit passengers and workers to wear masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. The White House Office of Management and Budget called the provision in a U.S. House of Representatives spending bill requiring the masks "Overly restrictive." It added that "Such decisions should be left to states, local governments, transportation systems, and public health leaders." Airlines, Amtrak and most public transit systems and U.S. airports require all passengers and workers to wear facial coverings.

> I work in Toronto with people from dozens of foreign countries, and I would say the number one complaint they have about life in Toronto is the restriction on drinking in places like parks. I agree that it's a needlessly draconian law.
