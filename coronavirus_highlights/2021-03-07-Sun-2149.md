## Covid Infections Fall Steeply in Nursing Homes Since Vaccine Rollout

Summary of [original article](https://www.route-fifty.com/health-human-services/2021/03/covid-infections-fall-steeply-nursing-homes-vaccine-rollout/172404/):

> Covid-19 infections in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have dropped by 82% since the first coronavirus vaccines became available in December, according to a new report. The data, collected by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, suggests that vaccinations of elderly residents and health care workers have helped dramatically cut the number of new infections and deaths in nursing homes. The data on new nursing home infections is "Incredibly encouraging," said Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of AHCA/NCAL. "This new data showcases just how important it is for nursing homes' residents and staff, as well as the general public, to get the vaccine because it is clearly working," Parkinson said.
