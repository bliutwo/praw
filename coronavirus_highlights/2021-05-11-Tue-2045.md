## Average daily U.S. Covid cases fall below 40,000 for the first time since September

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/covid-19-cases-deaths-vaccinations-daily-update.html):

> The rate of new Covid cases in the U.S. fell to an average of 38,800 per day Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the first time daily case counts have been below 40,000 since September. The U.S. is reporting 38,800 daily new infections, based on a seven-day average of data compiled by Hopkins, down 22% from a week ago and 46% from the most recent high, when the country was seeing about 71,000 daily cases in mid-April. Reported deaths tend to lag case data by weeks, as it takes time for those who get sick to become hospitalized and die, so the latest death numbers may still be reflecting infection levels from a time when nationwide case counts were higher.

> Call me crazy, but I think we can reach just around 50k cases a week sometime this Summer.

## Got the vaccine? Experts say you can relax about your Covid-19 risk now. Really.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/22423098/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-protection-herd-immunity):

> As more of the population gets the vaccine, it's prudent to keep masking and avoiding large gatherings, and for people who've been vaccinated to share their stories and encourage their friends and family to get vaccinated, too. Even with the spread of the variants, the consensus among experts is that vaccinated people shouldn't worry much about their own risk of Covid-19. In the typically cautious worlds of science and public health, experts want to see a bit more research and data before they declare that vaccinated people can throw out their masks and gather in large numbers indoors.

> Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at UC San Francisco, told me. “I haven’t been to bars, concerts, theaters, but that probably reflects the fact that I’m a rather boring person.”
> 
> Hey, I appreciate the honesty.

## Study: 99.75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients weren't vaccinated

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/study-hospitalized-coronavirus-patients-unvaccinated-7ed34f63-fd1d-437c-b4b7-0c1dd3600a15.html):

> The Cleveland Clinic on Tuesday released a study showing that 99.75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between Jan. 1 and April 13 were not fully vaccinated, according to data provided to Axios. Details: The study also looked at 47,000 Cleveland Clinic employees who had received one shot, both shots or no shots at all. The study found that in this group, mRNA vaccines were more than 96% effective in protecting against coronavirus infections.

`/u/yelo_melo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/naa357/study_9975_of_hospitalized_covid19_patients/):

> We need to start referring to the non-vaccinated as the "vulnerable" population. It's not only correct, it's also a group that many tough-as-nails-don't-need-no-vaccine types may not like to be part of. It might encourage more of them to get their shots.
