## More Than 150 Experts Urge the U.S. to Shut Down as Coronavirus Cases Surpass 4 Million

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/health/experts-urge-us-shut-down-as-coronavirus-cases-surpass-4-million/):

> With every state, county and city in the U.S. in their own version of phased reopenings and soaring numbers of new COVID-19 infections, the experts said political leaders need to "Shut it down now, and start over." "Of all the nations in the world, we've had the most deaths from COVID-19. At the same time, we're in the midst of 'reopening our economy,' exposing more and more people to coronavirus and watching numbers of cases - and deaths - skyrocket," the experts, which include researchers and doctors from Harvard, Stanford and UC Berkeley, among many others, wrote. The experts say that the U.S. should shut down all non-essential business, limit restaurants to take-out only and have people stay at home except for food, medicine and walks or exercise - and masks "Should be mandatory" in public spaces.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vulture.com//2020/07/doja-cat-tests-positive-for-covid-19.html):

> The textbook definition of "Irony" just got a new entry, as controversial singer-songwriter Doja Cat revealed that she tested positive for the coronavirus months after mocking those who took it seriously. "I'm okay now. It was a four-day symptom freakout but I'm fine now." In March, Doja Cat likened COVID-19 to a flu and insisted that she wasn't "Scared" of living in a pandemic world. "I'm gonna get corona and then I'm gonna get a Corona, cause I don't give a fuck about corona, bitch," she said on Instagram at the time.

## COVID-19 Outbreak Linked to Bible Conference That Refused to Shutdown Event

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/covid-19-outbreak-linked-bible-conference-that-refused-shutdown-event-1520519):

> A Bible conference in Colorado that threatened to sue the state over a cease-and-desist order calling for the event to be shutdown has been linked to 34 new cases of COVID-19. The Summer Family Bible Conference, held by Andrew Wommack Ministries and Charis Bible College from June 29 to July 3, has had 15 employees and staff members test positive, along with another 15 conference attendees and four others, according to The Pikes Peak Courier. The following week, from October 5 to 9, there will be a Ministers' Conference at the Charis Bible College, the same venue as the Summer Family Bible Conference.

`/u/fredandlunchbox` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hxwa99/covid19_outbreak_linked_to_bible_conference_that/):

> Here’s the thing: even if zero deaths result from this, the financial impact will not be zero. It can ruin someone’s life without taking their life. This “If I die, it’s gods will,” bullshit doesn’t account for the crushing impact it can have on someone’s whole family. It’s so selfish and negligent.
