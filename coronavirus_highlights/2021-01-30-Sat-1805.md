> "Assuming all of the close review of the J&J data all pans out, we're going to have the capacity between Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, to have enough vaccines available by June for the entire U.S. adult population," McClellan, a former FDA commissioner, said on "The News with Shepard Smith." The United States has ordered 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine, which the company plans to deliver by June. If J&J's vaccine is authorized by the FDA, it would be the third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. Pfizer's vaccine was authorized by the FDA on Dec. 11, and Moderna's was authorized a week later.
