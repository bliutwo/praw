## They had coronavirus. Now they’re showing up at memory clinics with serious cognitive loss

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/11/they-had-coronavirus-now-theyre-showing-up-at-memory-clinics-with-serious-cognitive-loss.html):

> The journal Neurology Today is reporting hundreds of COVID-19 "Long-haulers" being treated for cognitive problems at specialty clinics set up in areas hardest hit by the virus. Rondeau, who founded the Montclair Memory Clinic in 2001, had seen instances in the past where a virus similar to COVID-19 led to perplexing cognitive loss in a person who had no previous memory issues. That's what leaves Rondeau and other experts concerned about the cognitive issues now being seen in people who have survived coronavirus.

> A fellow doctor that I treated as a patient of mine lost most of his memory and will probably never work as a doctor ever again. He is in neurological therapy but there is only so much you can do against hundreds of ministrokes.

> >Even though the coronavirus “may seems special because it affects most of humankind” there are “a thousand other crises that are just as dire” but we can pretend they don’t exist because they don’t affect us so directly. Among these “unseen viruses” are climate change, the refugee crisis, hunger and wars. “To come out of this crisis better, we have to recover the knowledge that as a people we have a shared destination,” Francis wrote. “The pandemic has reminded us that no one is saved alone.”

## The young die as well from COVID-19, even as many engage in denial

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/11/28/fighting-dangerous-myth-covid-only-threatens-old-ill/6440182002/):

> "Many have died and many will die. In addition, healthy people are continuing to unknowingly spread COVID to the elderly, who, in turn, become quite ill and are at higher risk for death." McSparron said the myth that the young have little to fear from COVID has also led to people unknowingly infecting friends and loved ones, who have then died. "Unfortunately, someone visited him at home who did not know they had COVID. The young man did end up getting COVID and dying of COVID.".

> I like to think I remember what it was like to be young.  Certainly, my track record of decisions in my teens and 20s does not support the hypothesis that I would have acted much different in their shoes.  So, for that reason, I am able to easily forgive their short-term and mildly self-absorbed perspective in all of this. 
> 
> Its the rest of us who are old enough to know better but still acting like rebellious teenagers that I take issue with.
