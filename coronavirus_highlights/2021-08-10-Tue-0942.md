## ‘Worrying’ numbers of pregnant women in intensive care with Covid

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/09/worrying-numbers-of-pregnant-women-in-intensive-care-with-covid):

> Figures from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre showed that in England, Wales and Northern Ireland 66 pregnant women ended up in intensive care in July, the highest number since the pandemic began and three times as many as April last year. The mean age of admission is 32.Dr Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "The number of pregnant women being admitted to ICU is worrying and reflects the rising prevalence of the virus in the UK that we saw in July."We have data of nearly 200,000 pregnant women receiving the vaccine with no safety concerns We recommend that all pregnant women should get vaccinated against Covid-19, as the best way to protect themselves and their babies against severe illness and premature birth. Manchester health and care commissioning body recently tweeted: "We have seen higher rates of admissions to the intensive care unit among pregnant women after catching Covid-19".The chief executive of University Hospitals of North Midlands trust, Tracy Bullock, told a meeting of the trust board: "One of the other things we're seeing which is of real concern is around pregnancy."We know that both locally and nationally there's a very high rate of unvaccinated pregnant women.

## Dozens of Texas hospitals are out of ICU beds as COVID-19 cases again overwhelm the state's capacity

Summary of [original article](https://www.kristv.com/news/coronavirus/dozens-of-texas-hospitals-are-out-of-icu-beds-as-covid-19-cases-again-overwhelm-the-states-capacity):

> Every week, the federal government releases the ICU capacity data reported by about 200 Texas hospitals with more than four ICU patients or four staffed ICU beds. "We need to make sure that there's beds and hospitals and staff in hospitals available to take care of people who don't just have COVID-19, but all of those other conditions," said Dr. Jennifer Shuford, chief state epidemiologist for the Texas Department of State Health Services. At times, he said hospitals have had no pediatric ICU beds available and had to transport young patients across the state or even out of the state.

> U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) today introduced the No Mask Mandates Act and No Vaccine Mandates Act. The No Mask Mandates Act ends the Biden administration's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mask mandate for all Americans-regardless of vaccination status. The No Vaccine Mandates Act would require people administering a COVID-19 vaccine to first obtain the patient's informed consent or, if the patient is a child, the informed consent of a parent or guardian. The bill also imposes civil penalties for violating a patient's right by vaccinating against COVID-19 without consent.

## Austin schools to require masks in defiance of Gov. Abbott’s order

Summary of [original article](https://www.kxan.com/news/education/set-for-school/austin-isd-board-set-to-discuss-covid-19-safety-protocols-before-students-head-back-to-class/):

> AUSTIN - Austin Independent School District will require masks at all of its campuses and district offices, starting Wednesday, AISD Superintendent Stephanie Elizalde announced at a special-called board meeting Monday. The meeting was called just a day after the Houston Independent School District superintendent proposed a mask mandate for all students and staff in its district - despite an executive order issued by Gov. Greg Abbott which explicitly prohibits school districts and other government entities from requiring masks. "Governor Abbott's order does not limit the district's rights as an employer and educational institution to establish reasonable and necessary safety rules for its staff and students," a DISD district statement read. According to a recent survey sent to Austin ISD families, 80% of the more than 27,000 respondents said they planned to send their children to school wearing a mask.
