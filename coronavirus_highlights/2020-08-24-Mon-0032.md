> Not zero. That’s what I keep trying to impress upon other parents and people who are being lackadaisical about all of this.

> Few children hospitalized isn’t no children hospitalized. Few child deaths isn’t no child deaths.

> God, I had thought he was being such a wimpy weasel, refusing to criticize Trump or tell us what really happened in the White House, until I read this:
> 
> > **Fauci**: One of the reasons why I believe I have been able to effectively and successfully advise six presidents of the United States all the way back to Ronald Reagan is because I stay completely apolitical. I'm a scientist. I'm a physician. I'm a public health individual. I do not have an ideology. I certainly don't express it. And I never, ever, get involved in politics. Once you do that, you can diminish your credibility as a scientist and a public health official! So, I have been neutral throughout the six presidents that I have served.

> >Q: If you could, for those of us who sometimes wake up with this feeling of doom, how do we turn this around? How do we stop the suffering? Can you tell us what keeps you going and why we should be optimistic?

> >A: Well, that’s a good way to end the discussion, Geoff, because this will end. I mean, when you’re in something that’s so stressful, you have to worry about despair setting in. Like, “My God, I’m in a hopeless situation.” It’s not. It will end. We will get out of this and we will return to normal. Don’t give up. Don’t despair. Don’t throw caution to the wind. We can end this. The combination of pulling together with public health measures and the scientific advances of vaccines and therapies and preventions. I will guarantee you that.
