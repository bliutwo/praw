## Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine found to be effective against Covid variant discovered in the UK

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/covid-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-likely-to-be-effective-against-uk-variant.html):

> Sahin said the vaccine also should prove to be effective against a variant discovered in South Africa - another highly transmissible mutation that has raised concerns. His comments came shortly after initial tests had shown Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine appeared to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the virus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. Now, scientists from the two companies have published research indicating the vaccine is likely to be effective against all mutations associated with B.1.

## Pfizer Covid vaccine could increase antibodies up to 20 times - and may stop transmission

Summary of [original article](https://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/health/coronavirus/pfizer-covid-vaccine-could-increase-antibodies-20-times-and-may-stop-transmission-3106519):

> The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine could increase antibodies up to 20 times after the second dose and may prevent people from passing the virus on to others, new research has shown. People who have been given the Pfizer vaccine have up to 20 times more antibodies than those who have had coronavirus and recovered, according to recent findings. More than four million people have now received their first dose of either the Pfizer or Oxford Covid-19 vaccine so far in the UK. The vaccination programme began its rollout on 8 December 2019 and has already seen more than half of those aged 80 and over receive the first of their two jabs.

> glad they published this, it feels it's like people have never got the flu or cold before - you get that from talking to someone for a little while, so if covid is more contagious, of course you get it through maskless chats, not just coughing. nobody in my social circle seems to grasp that concept. boggles my mind how clueless everybody is about contagious diseases....

## Supermarket chain Aldi to pay U.S. workers who get COVID-19 vaccination

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-aldi-idUSKBN29O1GN):

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - German supermarket chain Aldi on Tuesday became the latest firm in the grocery sector to offer incentives for U.S. employees getting a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it would give up to four hours of pay to those who choose to receive inoculations. Dollar General Corp last week offered frontline employees a similar incentive after they get the vaccine, while grocery delivery company Instacart said it would pay $25 to more than half-a-million gig workers if they chose to take time off to get vaccinated. Aldi said it was working with officials across the United States to get workers priority access to the vaccine, joining other companies including Amazon.com Inc and Uber Technologies Inc lobbying to move workers closer to the front of the line for vaccinations.
