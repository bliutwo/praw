## US Reports More COVID-19 Cases In The Last Two Weeks Than It Did For All Of June

Summary of [original article](https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/07/23/us-more-covid-19-cases-two-weeks-all-of-june/):

> In the past two weeks, the US recorded more than 915,000 new cases of coronavirus - that's more than the cases reported across the country for the entire month of June. The surge in new cases across the South and Southwest has now been linked back to Americans' travel around Memorial Day and reopenings, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday. Louisiana, where the governor said earlier this month progress made in June against the virus was wiped out in weeks, is set to join at least 11 other states who have reported a total of more than 100,000 infections.

## 'Our backs are to the wall': Texas hospital to turn away COVID-19 patients with poor survival chances

Summary of [original article](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-flow/our-backs-are-to-the-wall-texas-hospital-to-turn-away-covid-19-patients-with-poor-survival-chances.html):

> A Texas hospital has formed an ethics committee to screen all COVID-19 patients for survival potential and send home those with low survival chances, according to Border Report. Patients with low recovery chances will be better cared for at home with loved ones rather than dying at a hospital thousands of miles away, Dr. Vazquez said. Currently, Texas has more COVID-19 patients hospitalized than any other state, with 10,848 COVID-19 patients as of July 22.

`/u/badatwinning` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hw7slv/our_backs_are_to_the_wall_texas_hospital_to_turn/):

> "There is nowhere to put these patients. The whole state of Texas and neighboring states have no ICU beds to spare for us," Dr. Vazquez said.

She went unconscious the next day before her family realized how serious the situation was and could get her to an ER. "We are in absolute shock as she had only experienced mild symptoms as a young, vibrant 25-year-old who was busy planning her wedding," the statement said. "On behalf of the family of Aliyah Marsh".

> > "On behalf of the family of Aliyah Marsh
> 
> > Our precious Aliyah (Alli) Marsh passed away suddenly in her home from symptoms associated with Covid-19 at 3 p.m. Tuesday, July 21 after the valiant efforts by paramedics to do everything they could to resuscitate her. Alli and her fiancé, Adam, were nearing the end of their quarantine when she began to experience difficulty breathing overnight, and then went unconscious the next day before we realized how serious the situation was and could get her to the ER. We are in absolute shock as she had only experienced mild symptoms as a young, vibrant 25-year-old who was busy planning her wedding —losing her to this illness and preparing to bury her was not something we could have ever imagined.
> 
> > For all of you who love Alli like we do, we are so sorry. We are sorry for this community, who has lost a true treasure … a young woman with a smile and a spark that could light up any darkness.
> 
> > We are not seeking sympathy, we are simply hoping that you will use our experience to your own benefit. Maybe, like us, you didn’t really know what Covid-19 was capable of. Now that you know, the question is simply what you are going to do to protect yourselves and your families. We understand that certain preventative measures are not realistic for everyone as we all need to work, but please please take this opportunity to do whatever you can do to prevent this from happening to your family or others. We can no longer act like we don’t really know what this virus can do.
> 
> > Thank you for the outpouring of support and love for our family. We are blessed by every bit of love and comfort so many of you have offered."
> 
> Damn.

## Delta has banned more than 100 passengers for not wearing a mask

Summary of [original article](https://thepointsguy.com/news/delta-mask-policy-enforcement/):

> Banning over 100 passengers during the entire duration of the mask requirement may sound like a lot. We reached out to both carriers to ask about how many passengers they've banned for failing to wear a mask. Just like you can be banned for not following a crewmember's instructions, you can be barred for not wearing a mask.

`/u/HIVnotAdeathSentence` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hw6rzo/delta_has_banned_more_than_100_passengers_for_not/):

> Finally, a no fly list the public is likely to support.
