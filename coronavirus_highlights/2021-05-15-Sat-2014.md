## Netherlands sends 700 thousand corona vaccines to Suriname (enough to vaccinate the entire adult population)

Summary of [original article](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederland-stuurt-700-duizend-coronavaccins-naar-suriname~bbedf2d9/):

> Minister Hugo de Jonge van VWS zei afgelopen week in het parlement dat Nederland vanwege 'de speciale relatie' met Suriname in gesprek zou gaan over de mogelijk te bieden hulp. President Chan Santokhi van Suriname, wiens regering de banden met Nederland volledig heeft hersteld, nam hierop donderdag een voorschot door in een toespraak te zeggen dat Nederland voldoende vaccins zou sturen om 'de totale bevolking' van circa 650 duizend mensen te laten inenten. Maar op ambtelijk niveau is tussen de ministeries van Volksgezondheid in Nederland en Suriname duidelijk gemaakt dat het waarschijnlijk om zo'n 700 duizend vaccins in totaal zal gaan.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-15/50-percent-of-californians-are-vaccinated-against-covid-19):

> California has achieved a milestone in its five-month-long vaccination campaign: More than 50% of residents have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. Overall, about 38% of California residents are fully vaccinated, meaning they have received either both shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In the home of Silicon Valley, Santa Clara County, officials found that just 45% of Filipino Americans age 16 and older had received at least one dose of vaccine, while 59% of Chinese Americans, 64% of Indian Americans and 74% of Vietnamese Americans have been at least partially vaccinated.

## New York won't ease mask rules just yet amid review of CDC recommendations

Summary of [original article](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/ny-state-of-politics/2021/05/13/new-york-won-t-ease-mask-rules-amid-review-of-cdc-recommendations):

> New York officials will not ease the state's mask rules for vaccinated people just yet as Gov. Andrew Cuomo pledged a review of the recommendations made earlier on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We have received the newly revised guidance from the CDC regarding mask wearing and social distancing for those with vaccinations and are reviewing them in consultation with Dr. Zucker and our partners and health experts in surrounding states." The CDC announced earlier in the day mask wearing for people who have been fully vaccinated and have gained the two-week immunity following the second dose of the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine can be eased.

> How to science when a new study comes out:
> 
> 1.	If it agrees with your priors: read the abstract, nod your head in agreement, admire the authors for a job well done, and move on
> 2.	if it contradicts your priors: furiously start going through the technical details in an attempt to find a flaw or a limitation that will allow you to dismiss it
