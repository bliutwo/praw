The remaining five passengers were from Italy, New Zealand and England. Sardinia's governor, Christian Solinas, spoke on the matter: "The region of Sardinia has no responsibility for what happened. Immediately, with the collaboration of the airport management company, we set to work - initiating urgent talks with the government, the Ministry and the Prefect - to find a solution that would allow American passengers to stay in Sardinia, even by submitting to quarantine," said the Sardinian president.

> Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., has reportedly tested positive for Covid-19. NEW - Kim Guilfoyle, girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. and a top campaign official, tested positive for coronavirus in SD ahead of attending Mt Rushmore event, according to a person familiar w what happened. The positive test from someone deep within Trump's personal inner circle presents an embarrassing and inconvenient contradiction for Trump, who earlier this week downplayed the pandemic and said it would "Just disappear" and it comes amid a massive spike in Covid-19 cases across dozens of states that fueled the country to a single-day record of more than 55,000 new coronavirus cases.

## At least 8 Secret Service agents stuck in Phoenix with coronavirus after Pence trip

Summary of [original article](https://abc17news.com/politics/national-politics/2020/07/03/at-least-8-secret-service-agents-stuck-in-phoenix-with-coronavirus-after-pence-trip/):

> At least eight Secret Service agents are currently holed up in a hotel in Phoenix, some suffering the flu-like coronavirus symptoms after coming down with the disease while preparing for a visit by Vice President Mike Pence, two people familiar with the matter say. As Trump and Pence resume regular travel schedules after months of pandemic-induced lockdown, the risks posed to the large contingent of US Secret Service personnel who accompany them have become obvious as roughly two dozen agents - if not more - have tested positive for the virus, sources familiar with the situation said. At least eight Secret Service agents assigned to Pence's detail ahead of his trip to Arizona this week tested positive for the coronavirus right before the vice president was scheduled to travel there, a law enforcement source told CNN. It's unclear if there's overlap with the agents from Tulsa and Phoenix.

> >One agency source said there is “growing anger and frustration” among some in the Secret Service at what they consider to be **“unnecessary trips and exposure” because of Trump and Pence’s travel.**
> 
> Imagine being Secret Service and being forced to expose yourself like this. Like most of us they probably can't wait until this this administration fucks off.
