## Dr. Fauci says pause on trial is 'not uncommon at all' after major coronavirus vaccine trial placed on hold

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/09/dr-fauci-says-pause-on-trial-is-not-uncommon-at-all-after-major-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-placed-on-hold.html):

> White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday it's "Not uncommon" that AstraZeneca is holding up its coronavirus vaccine trial for a safety review, but the "Serious adverse event" with one of the participants is unfortunate. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca said it paused its phase three trial for a potential Covid-19 vaccine, called AZD1222, due to safety concerns. In a statement released Tuesday, AstraZeneca described the pause on its trial as a "Routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials." The company added that it is trying to expedite the review to "Minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline."

> No one thinks itâ€™s uncommon right? Just waiting to hear if the persons issue is related to the vaccine or not?
> Maybe Iâ€™ve been under the wrong impression. I didnâ€™t think the pause was uncommon, just not great until itâ€™s known why this person is reacting.

## Californiaâ€™s GOP Senate leader was under quarantine. She spoke with no mask at a huge prayer event anyway.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/09/shannon-grove-church-quarantine-california/):

> In front of thousands of worshipers packed shoulder-to-shoulder outside the Capitol, California Senate Minority Leader Shannon Grove grabbed the microphone on Sunday and promised the huge church event would have a real impact. Grove has come under added fire because she was supposed to be quarantining after coming into close contact with state Sen. Brian Jones, who tested positive on Aug. 26 for covid-19. State health officials are urging anyone who attended the prayer event to self-quarantine and monitor for symptoms - but the group that organized it has already moved on to stage similarly mask-free events farther up the West Coast.

## Iowa refuses to close bars and require masks as Covid-19 cases surge in cities

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/iowa-coronavirus-cases-bars-masks-stay-open):

> Iowa's governor, Kim Reynolds, is refusing to enforce a White House coronavirus taskforce recommendation to close bars and require people to wear masks after Covid-19 infections in some of the state's cities surged. In July, Anthony Fauci, the president's lead coronavirus expert, urged the midwest's political leaders to follow the science by warning that the region should learn from the surge in cases in southern states during the summer. Students at the University of Iowa have demanded testing after nearly 1,600 cases have been self-reported on the campus since 18 August but the university has resisted.

`/u/TheAustinKnight` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ipd1tt/iowa_refuses_to_close_bars_and_require_masks_as/):

> It's okay, Kim Reynolds "trusts" that Iowans will "do the right thing". They just need to have the temptation of the bad thing there in order to make sure they can do the right thing on their own.

> The flight attendant is probably one of the highest risk contacts on the plane. If the passenger asked in a reasonable manner they are not wrong.

## Coronavirus Tests Are Supposed to Be Free. The Surprise Bills Come Anyway.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-test-fees.html):

> One mother in California was surprised that her daughter's coronavirus test was fully covered but that a $49 "After hours" fee was not - the clinic said it provided tests only in the evening, so as to not infect other patients. The rules around the other tests are less clear: The law states that insurers must cover services related to obtaining a coronavirus test but doesn't identify what type of care makes the cut. Patients at a drive-through coronavirus testing site in Texas, for example, were unknowingly tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

`/u/achillymoose` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ipfm9j/coronavirus_tests_are_supposed_to_be_free_the/):

> This is why Americans are hesitant to take up offers on "free" government programs. Literally nothing is free in this country. You could get shot by a cop and they'd send you a bill in the mail for the bullet.
