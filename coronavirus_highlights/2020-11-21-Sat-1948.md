As of mid-August, 24 of Kansas's 105 counties had abided by the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate, and 81 counties had opted out, as Kansas law allows. Kansas is among 37 states that mandate the wearing of face masks in public to curb the spread of COVID-19, according to a list maintained by AARP. Other states have recommended wearing face masks but have not implemented statewide orders.

> On Tuesday, he and 700 other nurses at the medical center went on strike after saying they were poorly compensated and short-staffed despite all they had to deal with as the virus surges again. "Nurses are totally burned out from this," said Deborah Burger, a registered nurse and co-president of National Nurses United. Hospital nurses said St Mary has a 30% turnover rate, with 243 of their colleagues leaving in the last two years alone, though representatives from the administration say the turnover rate is lower.

> The fatigue of fighting losing battles in health care is real.  If there was one thing I was hoping would come out of this, it was an EMS union or at least realistic pay.
> 
> $13-$15 an hour isn't worth risking your life for.
> 
> Edit:  there seems to be confusion. This is not about nurses, but EMTs

## Fauci: 'Terribly Painful Months' Are Coming

Summary of [original article](https://www.newser.com/story/299051/faucis-view-on-the-next-few-months-terribly-painful.html):

> In comments to the New York Times on Friday, he expressed his opinion that "December, January and early February are going to be terribly painful months." He attributed that prediction to the steepness of the case-count curve. "It's almost an exponential curve," he explained. "When you have an exponential curve up like that, by the time it peaks and then comes ultimately down, the duration of the surge is much longer." The Times provides context: "Epidemiologists dread exponential growth because cases can quickly double, then double again." But Fauci wasn't all doom and gloom, saying the "Spectacular results of the vaccines" are sources of real hope.
