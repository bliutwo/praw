Phil Murphy, D-N.J., whose state saw one of the earlier coronavirus spikes, recounted the "Enormous price" the state has already paid - more than 13,000 dead from the virus. Murphy said Americans should continue to follow public health guidelines but also called for a national strategy that he said is imperative to controlling the virus' spread. The White House has repeatedly deferred to state and local officials, instead offering unenforced guidelines and sending mixed messages on things like masks. While masks were available to attendees, neither masks nor social distancing were required, something Gov. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., lamented on "Meet the Press."
