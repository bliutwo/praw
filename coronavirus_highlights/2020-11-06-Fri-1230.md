## Reopening schools causes coronavirus R rate to surge, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/coronavirus-r-rate-school-closures-lockdown-lancet-study-b1251617.html):

> Reopening schools following coronavirus lockdowns is linked to a surge in transmissions within a month, according to the first study to look at the impact of lifting restrictions on the R rate. "We found an increase in R after reopening schools but is not clear whether the increase is attributable to specific age groups, where there may be substantial differences in adherence to social distancing measures within and outside classrooms," said Harish Nair, professor of paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh. They said some of the greatest effects on R were seen for measures that were more easily enforceable by law, like schools reopening and public events bans.

> My kids are remote by choice, and even their remote friends are talking about weekend slumber parties and big birthday celebrations. My kids are more upset by that then the kids who still go in-person.
