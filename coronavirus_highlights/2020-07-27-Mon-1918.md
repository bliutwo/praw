> Saving you a click,
> 
> *"A couple who insisted on having 100 guests for their wedding have contracted coronavirus, alongside eight of their friends.*
> 
> *The wedding, that took place in early July, was held at the SS Peter and Paulâ€™s Church, which overlooks Washington Square Park in San Francisco, California.*
> 
> *The couple* ***also held a rehearsal dinner the night before the event****, which more than 40 guests attended, according to the San Francisco Chronicle."*
> 
> *" As the guests were arriving at the venue, an official from the city showed up and told them that it* ***could not go ahead as planned****, because the amount of guests involved violated an executive order in the state.* 
> 
> *The couple, alongside eight of their guests tested positive for the virus, after they started showing symptoms of Covid-19 within five days of the ceremony.*
> 
> *The guest list at the wedding included* ***people travelling*** *from all over the US, including Texas and Arizona, which have both struggled with the pandemic and recorded record cases in the last six weeks."*
> 
> So 10 people mainly from the rehearsal dinner, would have probably been worse if the Wedding had gone ahead as scheduled.

## Google to Keep Employees Home Until Summer 2021 Amid Coronavirus Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-keep-employees-home-until-summer-2021-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11595854201?mod=e2tw):

> SAN FRANCISCO-Google will keep its employees home until at least next July, making the search-engine giant the first major U.S. corporation to formalize such an extended timetable in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Until now, Google had told its employees to expect a return to the office beginning in January. In New York City, only 8% of the employees who work in downtown office buildings managed by office colossus CBRE Group Inc. have returned from sheltering in place from the pandemic.

> Good option. I am not in the tech industry, but I am liking the WFH option. I hope more companies allow for permanent WFH jobs.

`/u/RichardBLine` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hyzay3/herman_cain_still_hospitalized_more_than_3_weeks/):

> "The big picture: The 74-year-old Cain, co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa in June and did not wear a mask. Two days after he was said to have tested positive, Cain commented on a July 4 celebration at Mt. Rushmore, tweeting: "Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!""
> 
> I bet he's fed up being in a hospital taking oxygen from a machine.  This all could heve been avoided by wearing a mask instead of mocking it.  It's really hard to feel sorry for people like this.
