> "Essentially, OSHA is AWOL," said David Michaels, a former head of OSHA under the Obama administration who now teaches at George Washington University's school of public health. "The OSHA response to this crisis has been horrible. There's been more complaints filed with OSHA in the past four months than any previous four months," said Peter Dooley, a certified industrial hygienist with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, a federation of private, non-profit coalitions that advocates for worker health and safety. Overall, OSHA had received 208 COVID-19 related complaints and opened 19 inspections in Florida as of June 24, a spokesperson said.

> An Ohio man who died due to complications from COVID-19 has drawn criticism for his staunch refusal to wear a mask earlier in the pandemic.

"Rick is getting slaughtered online right now for his decision that he made not to wear a mask and that's not right," Conley said.

## Every U.S. state is accumulating new virus cases at a faster clip than Canada. Yep, all 50.

Summary of [original article](https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/every-u-s-state-is-accumulating-new-virus-cases-at-a-faster-clip-than-canada-yep-all-50/):

> On a per capita basis, the coronavirus crisis in the United States is so bad that all 50 states are logging more new cases than Canada is. Even New York, where residents are relieved to have the worst days of the first wave behind them, new cases are popping up at a level near quadruple that of Canada. In the worst week for new cases in Québec in late April and early May, the province averaged 946 cases per day, according to data compiled by CBC News.

> Well... yeah. Of course they are. 
> 
> The US is getting almost as many cases *per day* as Canada **has gotten total**. 
> 
> Think about that. And Canada hasn't handled the situation particularly well either (Though obviously better than the USA) so we're no shining star, we're still top 20 in the world in deaths despite a smaller population.

## Dr. Fauci Says, “With All Due Modesty, I Think I’m Pretty Effective.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.instyle.com/news/dr-fauci-says-with-all-due-modesty-i-think-im-pretty-effective):

> NO: I guess I'll start with the coronavirus task force! [laughs]. NO: What do you think some of the ethical issues are with COVID-19 that we are going to have to focus on? Starting with the issues around what do you do when a hospital gets to capacity and has no more beds or no more equipment? What do you do for health-care workers when they don't have adequate PPE and are putting themselves at risk? Issues around end-of-life care for people who are dying alone and there are no visitors allowed and no extra support for them.
