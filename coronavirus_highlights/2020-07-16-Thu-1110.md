Summary of [original article](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fauci/fauci-calls-white-house-criticism-of-him-bizarre-says-lets-stop-this-nonsense-and-fight-coronavirus-idINKCN24G2RZ):

> WASHINGTON - U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Wednesday called the White House effort to discredit him "Bizarre" and urged an end to the divisiveness over the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying "Let's stop this nonsense." Fauci, who has become a popular and trusted figure during the coronavirus outbreak, came under criticism from President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies as Fauci cautioned against reopening the U.S. economy too soon. The recent spike in coronavirus infections, primarily in states that were among the earliest to lift coronavirus restrictions, put Fauci on a collision course with the White House.
