## Leaked White House report warns current Covid-19 mitigation efforts 'inadequate'

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/18/us-coronavirus-deaths-latest-toll-white-house-taskforce-report):

> As the US death toll from Covid-19 closed in on 250,000 on Wednesday, with a caseload above 11.3m and more than 161,000 new cases added the previous day, an internal White House taskforce report warned of "Aggressive, unrelenting, broad community spread across the country, without evidence of improvement but, rather, further deterioration". Speaking anonymously, one White House official told the Associated Press the taskforce had concluded existing efforts to slow the spread "Are inadequate and must be increased to flatten the curve" and that Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, around the US holiday next Thursday, could "Amplify transmission considerably". Fauci also said: "Community spread doesn't stop spontaneously unless you do something about it. It is easier to stop when the level is relatively low. The only way that you can get at community spread is that you need to test people who are without symptoms, in order to show what the degree of penetrance of infection is."
