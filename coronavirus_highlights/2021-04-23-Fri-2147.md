## Vaccine FAQ: Variants, Chronic Conditions, NSAIDs, and more

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids/):

> Due to the more limited supply of the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech worldwide, the Moderna vaccine has not had as many large, nationwide studies specifically aimed at determining efficacy of the vaccine for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, though it is highly likely that given their highly similar mechanisms of action, properties found of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will likely hold for the Moderna vaccine. Per the CDC guidelines, the only absolute contraindications to vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine are a known and documented history of severe and/or immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or a component of the vaccine. Though not all regulatory bodies or jurisdictions have made firm indications, the US FDA has indicated that minor updates to approved vaccines to cover future variants of SARS-CoV-2 would not need to undergo a separate three-phase trial; rather, an expedited immunogenicity trial can be conducted to verify that the vaccine produces an immune response against the variant of the virus, and the vaccine could be quickly authorized and distributed as an amendment to the previous authorization or approval.

> Makes perfect sense. 
> 
> They had a slide which showed that for every 1 million doses within the most affected demographic (women 18-49), you could expect 13 cases (NOT deaths) of this reaction.
> 
> However, those 1 million doses within that demographic would also statistically *prevent* **12 covid deaths, 127 ICU admissions, and 657 hospitalizations** among that demographic given the current U.S. exposure risk.
> 
> And thatâ€™s just in the most affected demographic. 
> 
> For women over 50, every million doses would result in 2 adverse reactions, yet would **save 593 lives, 1292 ICU admissions and 4794 hospitalizations.**
> 
> In terms of general population, every 1M doses of j&j would result in 2 of these adverse reactions, yet would **save ~2,000 lives and 6,000 hospitalizations**
> 
> Edit: If you want to do something to help with vaccine hesitancy, **go report @justtheinserts on Instagram** for spreading verifiably false and deceptive information about this vaccine as well as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, all in the name of selling t-shirts.

## Israel records no new daily COVID deaths for first time in 10 months

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-reports-no-new-daily-covid-deaths-for-first-time-in-10-months/):

> For the first time in ten months, no new COVID-19 daily deaths were reported Thursday in Israel, according to the latest Health Ministry figures. Israel has seen a sharp drop in daily mortality and infection rates since the pandemic peaked in late-January, as the country pushes forward with its world leading vaccination drive. Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levi said Thursday that once that age group has been vaccinated, the country will reach herd immunity and there will be no need to inoculate younger children, according to the Kan public broadcaster.

## Houston Methodist says it will fire workers who refuse to take COVID vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Houston-Methodist-COVID-vaccine-refusal-fire-16121140.php):

> Jennifer Bridges, a nurse at Houston Methodist Hospital in Baytown, said she would take the vaccine once it's fully approved by the FDA, which could take years. Teal Riley, nursing director of Houston Methodist's ICU, was among the first clinicians in line for a COVID-19 vaccine when they arrived at the hospital. Houston Methodist was one of several companies to offer incentives for its workers to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

> I mean, duh. Unless you're venting air out or pulling fresh air in, breathing indoors means you're slowly mixing more and more of whatever germs you have into the entire space. Without a properly fitted N95 style mask, you're gonna breath a little of every germ the place has if you're there for a while.

## Vaccines Are Effective Against the New York Variant, Studies Find // The research adds to a growing number of findings suggesting the Pfizer and Moderna shots are protective against the variants identified so far.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html):

> "The take-home message is that the vaccines are going to work against the New York variant and the South African variant and the U.K. variant," said Nathan Landau, a virologist at N.Y.U.'s Grossman School of Medicine who led the study. April 23, 2021, 7:45 a.m. ET.In the second study, Dr. Landau's team found that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only marginally less protective against the variant that devastated Britain and against forms of the variant discovered in New York that don't contain the Eek mutation. South Africa suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after clinical trials showed that the vaccine did not prevent mild or moderate illness from the variant that was circulating there.
