## It’s Official—Americans Won’t Be Allowed Into Europe When It Reopens

Summary of [original article](https://www.afar.com/magazine/europe-finally-set-to-reopen-but-not-to-us-travelers):

> The European Union has revealed the list of countries whose travelers will be welcomed back to the continent on July 1, and it does not include the United States, according to a New York Times. The list still needs to be formalized by the governments of each member state as well as by the European Union before taking effect on July 1, but officials reportedly said they did not expect the list to change. As the Times points out, it's not a legally binding list, but any member state that opens borders to countries not on the list could find themselves shut off from other E.U. partners.

## Houston hospitals hit 100% base ICU capacity. Then they stopped reporting data.

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-hospitals-hit-100-base-ICU-capacity-15372256.php):

> The change came one day after the hospitals reported their base intensive care capacity had hit 100 percent for the first time during the pandemic, with projections showing the institutions - which together comprise the world's largest medical complex - were on pace to exceed their "Unsustainable surge capacity" by July 6. After reporting 17 charts and graphs on most days for three months, the organization did not post from Thursday morning until Saturday at about 9 p.m. When the charts re-appeared, eight of the 17 original slides had been deleted - including any reference to hospital capacity or projections of future capacity - and the lone remaining slide referencing the risks associated with shrinking capacity had been altered. An "Early warning" chart on Thursday reported base ICU capacity had reached 100 percent, and was marked with a red dot signifying a "Warning." On Saturday, the same chart no longer discussed ICU capacity but instead intensive care "Census growth," and was marked with an orange dot signifying "Moderate concern."

## Self-Absorbed, Uncaring, Incompetent: COVID Has Exposed Populist Leaders for What They Are

Summary of [original article](https://thewire.in/politics/trump-bolsonaro-jognson-modi-populist-leaders-covid):

> The pandemic clearly provides the first real test of these four high-profile populist leaders in handling a complex national crisis and offers a unique insight into their mode of functioning in the face of the challenges before them. The pandemic has revealed Modi as the archetypal populist leader that he is - totally egoistical and self-absorbed, believing his own slogan of the 2019 general election: Modi hai to mumkin hai. For, the pandemic called for leaderships that took expert advice and needed detailed plans instead of simplistic slogans, qualities that were well-beyond the capacities of populist leaders.

> And even in the face of their total failure some people keep supporting them.

## The data is in: Fox News may have kept millions from taking the coronavirus threat seriously

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/the-data-is-in-fox-news-may-have-kept-millions-from-taking-the-coronavirus-threat-seriously/2020/06/26/60d88aa2-b7c3-11ea-a8da-693df3d7674a_story.html):

> Three serious research efforts have put numerical weight - yes, data-driven evidence - behind what many suspected all along: Americans who relied on Fox News, or similar right-wing sources, were duped as the coronavirus began its deadly spread.Dangerously duped. "That's the real evil of this type of programming," Arthur West of the Washington League for Increased Transparency and Ethics, which sued Fox News in April over its coronavirus coverage, told the Times of San Diego. When confronted with the information in one study that cast Sean Hannity in a dim light, Fox News responded with defensive gaslighting - even using the specific phrase "Reckless disregard for the truth," which is most typically deployed by those threatening a libel suit.
