## China agrees to let in WHO team investigating Covid origins

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/11/china-agrees-to-let-in-who-team-investigating-covid-origins):

> A World Health Organization team of international experts tasked with investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic will arrive in China on 14 January, China's national health authority has said. The team was initially aiming to enter China in early January but China blocked their arrival, saying visas had not yet been approved, even as some members of the group were on their way. At the time, the WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed his dismay and said he had called on China to allow the team in: "I'm very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute," he said.

## Calgary pastor says church will continue to break COVID-19 rules, days after health order issued

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-church-covid-1.5868030):

> Pastor Tim Stephens wrote in an emailed newsletter to Fairview Baptist Church congregants on Wednesday that he had received a $1,200 fine from Calgary bylaw officers for violating public health orders. The community association said its board has passed a motion to indicate it will no longer hold meetings in the church's space, even after large gatherings are once again allowed under provincial health restrictions. "We are hopeful going forward your church will do what is necessary to minimize risk and to role model behaviour and choices that will protect our community - our neighbours and Fairview residents, but also the larger provincial population. Please do not continue to ignore the health of our community."

> In 4-6 weeks it would not surprise me if you could statistically parse out the impact of vaccination on the variation of state infection rates.

> Israel will also be a good test case as they should start see declining infections/hospitalizations soon.

## Record low flu cases show how COVID-19 is more contagious and 'less forgiving,' experts say

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sex-work-coronavirus-poverty-b1769426.html?utm_source=reddit.com):

> Increasing numbers of women are turning to sex work for the first time as the pandemic pushes them into "Desperate poverty", campaigners warned. Leading organisations which support sex workers said there has been a substantial rise in women doing sex work for the first time due to being over-represented in sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis. Niki Adams, a spokesperson for the English Collective of Prostitutes, said there has been a substantial surge in women calling to inquire about doing sex work for the first time or going back into it after having left for years during the Covid crisis.

> "We spend our days making people happy but we get judged by everyone. We have a lot of vulnerable clients who can’t create bonds in real life, but they are human. We’re not lawbreakers. It is the law that criminalises us. We have to be recognised for who we are. We are normal people. We pay council tax. We are someone’s neighbours. We are not aliens with two heads.”
> 
> Jesus Christ just decriminalize it already
