> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

> Cases are also on the rise in the US, which begs the question: should there be more lockdowns here as well? Data from a YouGov poll of nearly 13,000 US adults finds that almost two thirds of Americans would support their state instituting a one-month lockdown in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Around a quarter of Americans think a one-month state lockdown should be considered a violation of constitutional rights. Methodology: 12,764 US adults were asked "Would you support or oppose your state instituting a 1-month lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus?" and "Do you believe that a 1-month state lockdown due to COVID-19 should or should not be considered a violation of constitutional rights?" Interviews were conducted online October 29 - 30, 2020.

## Biden Covid advisor says U.S. lockdown of 4 to 6 weeks could control pandemic and revive economy

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/biden-covid-advisor-says-us-lockdown-of-4-to-6-weeks-could-control-pandemic-and-revive-economy.html):

> A nationwide lockdown would drive the number of new cases and hospitalizations down to manageable levels while the world awaits a vaccine, he told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. "The problem with the March-to-May lockdown was that it was not uniformly stringent across the country. For example, Minnesota deemed 78 percent of its workers essential," they wrote in the New York Times. On Wednesday, Osterholm said such a lockdown would help the country bring the virus under control, "Like they did in New Zealand and Australia." Epidemiologists have repeatedly pointed to New Zealand, Australia and other parts of Asia that have brought the number of daily new cases to under 10 as an example of how to contain the virus.

> Sounds right. But you need massive stimuli to save businesses. In Germany we have a shutdown right now for bars and restaurants. They get 75% of the money they made in November 2019 from the government. That keeps them alive for the time after the shutdown.

> “World record” is going to become a broken record for us here in the U.S. No state is going to implement appropriate measures until it’s already too late. We already have hospitals nearing, at, or overcapacity and hospital staff everywhere are strained to the point of breaking. I don’t even know what to say anymore. I’m just heartbroken.
