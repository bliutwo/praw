> > In multiple analyses, the researchers found that the vaccine was 87 to 89.5 percent effective at preventing infection with B.1.1.7 among people who were at least two weeks past their second shot. It was 72.1 to 75 percent effective at preventing infection with B.1.351 among those who had reached the two-week point.
> 
> > The vaccine was highly effective at protecting against the worst outcomes. Overall, it was 97.4 percent effective at preventing severe, critical or fatal disease from any form of the coronavirus, and 100 percent effective at preventing severe, critical or fatal disease caused by B.1.1.7 or B.1.351
> 
> Very effective against both infection and severe disease. Consistent with J&J being around 15% worse off against the SA variant. 70%+ is still well and above what is required.

## U.S. backs Covid vaccine intellectual property waivers to expand access to shots worldwide

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/us-backs-covid-vaccine-intellectual-property-waivers-to-expand-access-to-shots-worldwide.html):

> "As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts - working with the private sector and all possible partners - to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines," the statement added. Critics have argued that patents on vaccines and other protections are not the central obstacle to producing more vaccines for the nations that need them most. "A solution more in line with the Administration's stated objectives of improving U.S. competitiveness and keeping jobs in America would be to produce and export vaccines from the United States," Willems who worked under the Trump administration, added.

`/u/Worth-Enthusiasm-161` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n5o08z/us_backs_covid_vaccine_intellectual_property/):

> Up to now licensing production of vaccines does not seem to be the problem at all. It seems like sourcing personnel, equipment, materials and key ingredients is a much larger issue. Setting up vaccine lines takes months so immediately I think we are going to see very little effect by this waiver. 
> 
> With that being said, it is an important message to give that fighting covid is more important than financial gains, and all options needs to be on the table.

"You are starting to see more and more of them wearing them down below their nose because they are just tired of it," she said. Keri Rodrigues, a co-founder of the education advocacy group the National Parents Union, said she rushed out to get vaccinated after becoming eligible but has more trepidation about immunizing her oldest son, who is 13.She plans to go ahead with it in part because he is demanding it.

## CDC says coronavirus could be under control this summer in U.S. if people get vaccinated and are careful

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/05/pandemic-under-control-this-summer/):

> Coronavirus infections could be driven to low levels and the pandemic at least temporarily throttled in the United States by July if the vast majority of people get vaccinated and continue with precautions against viral transmission, according to a strikingly optimistic paper released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, more than 4,000 people a week are dying of the disease, and about 578,000 people in the United States have died of covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. He added that all six of the modeling teams that contributed to the CDC report envision a summer in which case numbers are low and outbreaks under control.

> 
> > The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given from the age of 12. A study of 2,000 participants aged 12 to 15 was conducted in the United States. Health Canada relies on the findings of this study to grant new permission for Pfizer's vaccine. "The trial used the same two-dose regimen and the same dose of vaccine as those authorized for adults," said Marc Berthiaume, director of the Bureau of Medical Sciences at Health Canada. "The data from the clinical trial showed that after the second dose, the prevention effectiveness of COVID-19 in this younger age group was 100%," said Dr Berthiaume. The provinces will now have to decide how to conduct vaccination campaigns for children.
