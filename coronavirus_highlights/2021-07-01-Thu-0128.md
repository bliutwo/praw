## CDC director: Vaccinated people 'safe' from delta variant, do not need to wear masks

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/560871-cdc-director-vaccinated-people-safe-from-delta-variant-do-not-need-to-wear):

> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director said Wednesday that fully vaccinated people are "Safe" from the current variants and do not need to wear masks, doubling down on CDC guidance as some others call for a return to mask wearing. The question of mask wearing has come back to the forefront given recommendations from Los Angeles County health officials, and from the World Health Organization, that even fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks indoors in public as a precaution due to the rise of the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus. ADVERTISEMENT. "If you are vaccinated, you are safe from the variants that are circulating here in the United States," Walensky said on NBC's "Today," adding it was "Exactly right" that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.

## Covid transmission 'common' in pet cats and dogs

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57666245):

> Swabs were taken from their pet cats and dogs to test for evidence of a current infection, while blood samples were also tested for antibodies suggesting a past exposure to Covid. A total of 48 cats and 54 dogs from 77 households were tested for Covid antibodies and their owners asked about their interaction with their pets. About 67% of the owned cats and 43% of the owned dogs tested positive, compared with 9% of dogs and cats from an animal shelter and 3% of stray cats in the area.

`/u/10390` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/obbqc5/covid_transmission_common_in_pet_cats_and_dogs/):

> “around 20% of exposed pets may be infected and that they eventually clear the infection just as most humans do," he said.
> "Most reports are that this infection appears to be asymptomatic.
> "It also seems that the virus does not normally transmit from dogs and cats to either other animals or their owners."

## Australia Finds Delta Covid-19 Variant Transmits In Less Than 10 Seconds

Summary of [original article](https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2021/06/25/australia-finds-delta-covid-19-variant-transmits-in-less-than-10-seconds/):

> KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 - Australian government officials have warned how easily the Delta coronavirus variant spreads, in mere seconds, after fleeting encounters between strangers at a mall in the state of New South Wales resulted in transmission of the disease. Dr Jeannette Young, chief health officer of Queensland, similarly highlighted the speed and ease of the spread of the Delta variant with "Very fleeting contact" in some cases. WHO's Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update on June 22 stated that the variant Alpha has been reported in 170 countries, territories or areas, Beta in 119 countries, Gamma in 71 countries and Delta in 85 countries.

> Has this been seen elsewhere other than Australia? That kind of transmission would mean a much larger number of infections elsewhere.
