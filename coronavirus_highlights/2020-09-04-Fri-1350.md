Doctors involved in the trials conducted "Two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia," on 76 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60, the Lancet article said. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief of Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF which is backing the vaccine, hailed The Lancet study as validation of his country's efforts in an interview with CNBC.

> There are many reasons to be suspicious of this vaccine, like the [resignation of their top doctor ](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/coronavirus-vaccine-russias-top-doctor-quits-over-untested-covid19-vaccine-sputnik-v/story/412974.html), and their general disregard for medical ethics.
> 
> That being said, they have some brilliant scientists there. Safety trials are for safety. If they have lucked out and produced a safe vaccine on the first try... Fantastic.
> 
> Let's hope that is the case and the world can get access to both it, and the research to verify that.

> *Edit: 
> 
> Lots of people saying that they can't trust this vaccine because it is from Russia. I get that, but realistically, they are now doing testing on it in multiple other countries. Being cautious is reasonable, dismissing something just because it is from Russia is... I'd say a tad overzealous.

Summary of [original article](https://www.interview-welt.de/2020/09/03/coronavirus-luftfilter-f%C3%BCr-jede-schulklasse-notwendig/):

> "Wenn wir verhindern wollen, dass sich die Schulkinder im Winter alle mit dem Coronavirus infizieren, brauchen wir in jedem Klassenraum einen mobilen Luftfilter", sagte Lauterbach der Düsseldorfer "Rheinischen Post". "Eine Luftfilteranlage kostet pro Schüler maximal 100 Euro. Das sollten uns die Kinder wert sein. Betriebe in der Corona-Krise hat der Staat sogar wöchentlich mit einem Vielfachen dieser Summe unterstützt", sagte der Virologe Lauterbach. "Deshalb appelliere ich an die Ministerpräsidenten der Länder, die Anschaffung der Luftfilteranlagen noch im September rasch zu beschließen", sagte Lauterbach.

The USA TODAY/Suffolk poll found that about two-thirds of the 1,000 voters surveyed - 67% - would either not take the vaccine until others have tried it or not take it at all.

We are now living in the future (2020) and our medical advances and computer modeling has increased greatly since the last major vaccine debacles.  Safety is #1 priority, but with the info we have available, it should not be impossible that we have a safe vaccine by November, but availability wont reach the healthy population until Feb/March.
