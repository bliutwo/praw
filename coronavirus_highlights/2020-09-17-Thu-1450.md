`/u/TapedeckNinja` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/iunx3q/france_reports_10593_new_cases_of_coronavirus/):

> France is also testing dramatically more than they were in the previous "wave" of the outbreak.  Back when France was getting pummeled in late March through April, they were doing ~10,000 tests per day with a ~15-20% positive rate.
> 
> Lately, France is doing 150,000-200,000 tests per day with a ~5-8% positive rate.
> 
> In all likelihood the scope of the outbreak was much larger back in March/April, there just wasn't enough testing to demonstrate it.  The mortality and hospitalization rates show that pretty clearly.  The prior "peak" was at the tail end of March and beginning of April, averaging about 4,500 cases per day ... and then by mid-April France was averaging some 900 deaths per day.  New cases reached 4,500+ per day again around August 28^th, and now they are averaging ~30 deaths per day.
> 
> Of course, this new "wave" of the outbreak is also probably largely circulating among younger people with schools open again.

## Maine 'superspreader' wedding linked to 170 Covid cases and seven deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/maine-wedding-superspreader-event):

> The "Superspreader" event started with wedding attendees in the Katahdin region and spread to the community at large and to a nursing home in Madison. "Tragic is the word for things that we don't have any control over. In this case, we don't have control over the virus but this pastor absolutely had the choice whether to perform the wedding," said the Rev Erika Hewitt, a Unitarian Universalist in Bath.Already struggling, Maine's summer wedding industry tightened rules, forcing people to pare down guest lists, or cancel events altogether. Her wedding is outdoors but she may have to drop more people from an indoor reception.

`/u/OriginalFurryWalls` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/iuhhvo/maine_superspreader_wedding_linked_to_170_covid/):

> I hope the "happy couple" and everyone who attended feels the weight of the astronomical medical bills and the death of 7 entirely undeserving people.
