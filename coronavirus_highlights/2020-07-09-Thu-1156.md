> Anti maskers don’t give a shit. Their problem is that this isn’t REALLY a science issue. It’s a “freedom” issue. They’re the petulant teenager who refuses to listen to authority, and they think it’s cool.

> These people don’t care about science, or studies. They are selfish. Masks very slightly inconvenience them so they cannot wear them.

> The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not revise its guidelines for reopening schools despite calls from President Donald Trump and the White House to do so, agency Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday. On Wednesday, while Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, warned that the country has to maintain control over the pandemic to get children back to school in the fall, Trump slammed the CDC's existing guidelines. The CDC guidelines for schools to reopen contain steps to keep children safe, including keeping desks to be placed six feet apart and for children to use cloth face coverings.

## States with severe coronavirus outbreaks should 'seriously look at shutting down' - Dr. Fauci

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/09/states-with-severe-coronavirus-outbreaks-should-seriously-look-at-shutting-down-dr-fauci-says.html):

> His comments come as the U.S. continues to push records for new cases reported each day, driven primarily by states in the South and West, across the so-called Sun Belt. The surge in cases across much of the U.S. has been driven by some states that reopened too early, said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "Among the states, and there's admission from within, some states went too fast, some states went according to what the timetable was, but the people in the state didn't listen and just threw caution to the wind," he said.
