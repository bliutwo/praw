In a letter to members, President and CEO Craig Jelinek wrote that entry will be granted only to those wearing a face mask or face shield.

> Short answer is yes. Despite health officials calling for people not to gather together with family, they are likely to be ignored. Same thing likely to also happen for Christmas and New Year.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/fauci-steve-bannon-beheading-head-on-pike-b1721780.html):

> Anthony Fauci has responded to Steve Bannon calling for his head to be "Put on a pike outside the White House," describing the situation as "Really kind of unusual", and not something he was taught to deal with in medical college. "When you have public figures like Bannon calling for your beheading, that's really kind of unusual, I think." Mr Bannon said on his podcast last week that he would like to put the heads of Dr Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray "On pikes" outside the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats.

`/u/lowtire` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jswjfl/really_kind_of_unusual_fauci_responds_to_bannon/):

> The fact that he has remained so calm during this whole ordeal since February is really impressive.

## 80 percent of those who died of Covid-19 in Texas county jails were never convicted of a crime

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/12/21562278/jails-prisons-texas-covid-19-coronavirus-crime-prisoners-death):

> Over 230 people have died from Covid-19 in Texas's correctional facilities - and in county jails, nearly 80 percent of them were in pretrial detention and hadn't even been convicted of a crime, according to a new report. A team of researchers at the University of Austin at Texas reviewed data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which has reported that at least 231 people have died of Covid-19 in the state's correctional facilities between March and October. Of the inmates in prison who died, nine of them had been approved for parole and were awaiting release, 21 of them had served 90 percent or more of their sentence, and 58 percent of those who died in prisons were eligible for parole.

`/u/Chocolat3City` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jt1zlw/80_percent_of_those_who_died_of_covid19_in_texas/):

> Jails are for holding the accused who aren't out on bail. Prisons are for housing the convicted.
> 
> Don't get me wrong, this is unacceptable, but the headline is a bit sensational. Most detainees in jail are not (yet) convicted.
> 
> Edit: /u/PDXGolem makes a good point below that many in jail actually convicted of lesser offenses. However, [about 80% of people in jails have not been convicted of a crime. ](http://prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) The Covid-19 death rate in Texas jails tracks almost perfectly along these lines. I agree with /u/Amazed_Alloy below on a possible alternative (and less sensational) headline of "Covid-19 does not discriminate based on if you have been convicted."
