> Obligatory sticky: I am not qualified to give medical advice. I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

## Many L.A. cops and firefighters aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19. Is this a public safety threat?

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-19/vaccination-rates-lag-among-california-public-safety-workers-drawing-concern):

> While about 72% of adult Californians and 64% of Los Angeles residents 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, only about 51% of city firefighters and 52% of LAPD officers are at least partially vaccinated. Many in policing and other public safety sectors lean to the political right, among whom vaccines - and vaccine mandates - have been ridiculed, despite the fact that Republican leaders including former President Trump have been vaccinated. Freddy Escobar, president of the United Fire Fighters of Los Angeles City, said the union does not support a mandate but has been working with the department to increase the number of vaccinated firefighters and "Will not stop pushing for additional LAFD vaccinations until we get as close to 100% as possible."

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-19-may-cause-loss-brain-tissue-delta-variant-fuels-steep-infection-rise-2021-06-18/):

> Delta variant fuels steep rise in England COVID-19 prevalence. The rapid spread of the extremely contagious Delta coronavirus variant, first identified in India, has driven a 50% rise in COVID-19 cases in England since May, researchers at Imperial College London said on Wednesday in their latest report from the REACT-1 prevalence survey. At the beginning of May, according to the researchers' estimates, around 60% of positive COVID-19 swab tests were due to the Delta variant.

## Models predict U.S. coronavirus infections could surge this fall if vaccination rates lag, former FDA chief says

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/20/us-coronavirus-infection-rate-fall-2021/):

> The transmission of the more contagious delta variant in the United States could spur a fall surge in coronavirus infections if only 75 percent of the country's eligible population is vaccinated, former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb said Sunday. Although Gottlieb cited one projection forecasting an increase in infections reaching as high as 20 percent of last winter's peak, he called that an "Aggressive estimate," saying he doesn't "Think it'll be quite that dire." But he said states with low vaccination rates already are showing a concerning rise in cases with the spreading of delta, which is up to 60 percent more contagious than earlier variants. "So Connecticut, for example, where I am, shows no upsurge of infection, but Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri show very substantial upsurges of infections. That's based entirely on how much population-wide immunity you have based on vaccination," Gottlieb said on CBS's "Face the Nation" program.

> And of course, we will get to hear the "i didn't know" recovery stories. Which i have zero sympathy for. You knew, but were to stupid to follow common sense...and it got you.

## Canada hits COVID-19 vaccine milestone as 75% receive one dose, 20% fully vaccinated

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7954768/canada-vaccine-target-covid):

> Speaking at a COVID-19 press conference last week on June 15, Tam said the variants used to develop those earlier models didn't include the Delta variant, which is the most infectious one tracked in Canada to date and is believed to cause more severe illness. The variant has already made its way to 10 provinces and one territory in the country and has been listed as a variant of concern by Health Canada. Two weeks after the second dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was found to provide 79 per cent protection against infection from the Delta variant, compared to 92 per cent against the Alpha variant.

`/u/2HandedMonster` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/o3lse4/canada_hits_covid19_vaccine_milestone_as_75/):

> And that 20% number will skyrocket over the next few weeks like the 1st dose did over the past two months
