## 15 million people in the U.S. have missed their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine, CDC says

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/02/missed-second-dose-covid19-vaccine/):

> Nearly 15 million people - or more than one in 10 of those eligible in the United States - have missed their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health officials have explained that people - in this case, nearly 15 million people - skip their second shots for a variety of reasons, such as mistakenly believing that they only need one dose to be protected. People who miss the optimal window for their second dose don't need to start over, according to the CDC. There's just less data on how effective the second dose is if administered more than 42 days after the first.

> A lot of my coworkers who had covid got the first shot and got so sick they didn’t get the second. They no longer had protected sick time left between covid and the first shot.

## COVID plummets as leading cause of death in the U.S.

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/leading-cause-death-covid-10623949-45d6-4ddc-8c12-d5775b4135d8.html):

> COVID-19 dropped to the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. in June, a marked decline from January 2021 when it was No. 1, new Kaiser Family Foundation data shows. Why it matters: COVID-19 is still wreaking major havoc in the U.S., especially among people who aren't vaccinated.

`/u/LuckyPunk7` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocwr9b/covid_plummets_as_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us/):

> Kind of sad that Heart Disease, Diabetes and Strokes are often brought on by weight issues, and are the main deaths of Americans. Your chances of stroke are like 5-10x higher than the general population if you're overweight, have diabetes II and a heart condition. All of which are brought on by weight and lack of exercise.
