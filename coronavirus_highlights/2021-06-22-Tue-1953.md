> Obligatory sticky: I am not qualified to give medical advice. I try to answer what I can as a basic scientist on this subreddit, but many of the comments in this thread and elsewhere need to be posed to a medical professional. I highly encourage everyone to register to this series and take advantage of the opportunity.

## CDC: Nearly every adult COVID-19 death is now "entirely preventable" thanks to vaccines

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/cdc-adult-coronavirus-death-delta-variant-vaccines-2c8e4479-e162-4ca9-9fae-7c692d26b95a.html):

> Adult deaths from COVID-19 are "At this point entirely preventable" thanks to vaccines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said during a White House coronavirus briefing on Tuesday. The big picture: NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said the Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is currently the greatest threat to the elimination of the coronavirus in the U.S. because it's more transmissible and associated with increased disease severity than the most common variant of the virus. Go deeper: New coronavirus variant gains foothold in the U.S..

> Immunocompromised people say hi.
> 
> You have no idea how devastating it is to have a family member who falls into that tiny percentage of people who are an exception to this statement by the CDC.

> Not that Fauci determines policy or anything so it's not really a ditch against him, but it's still amazing the government goes on about "learning from out mistakes to prevent this like last time" yet is so stubborn about going above and beyond for citizens it just won't put the simplest solution on the table: Direct Cash relief if you get the vaccine. Saying Delta is a threat will do little for people already against the shot.
