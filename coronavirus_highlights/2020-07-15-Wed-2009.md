Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/doctor-puts-on-six-face-masks-in-video-to-debunk-idea-that-they-lower-oxygen-levels-1.5025293):

> TORONTO - A doctor in Ireland has made a video that appears to debunk the notion that wearing a face mask can lower a person's oxygen levels. In the post, which has been liked and retweeted thousands of times, Tuathail said he was repeatedly asked by patients if wearing a face mask would lower their oxygen levels. Questions and debate about whether face coverings can lower your oxygen levels and do more harm than good have been circulating online ever since face masks became mandatory in places around the world as a precautionary measure to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

> It's nice that the doctor tried, but he's ultimately wasting his time. To the nuts, any sort of evidence which points away from the conspiracy is further evidence of the conspiracy itself. They just go deep and deeper into the rabbit hole.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/15/fauci-says-he-hasnt-thought-about-resigning-despite-white-house-criticism.html):

> White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he hasn't thought about resigning despite criticism in recent days from President Donald Trump and other administration officials about his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said he told the White House he found it "Bizarre" and thought the administration made a "Big mistake," but his job is too critical to quit now, according to an interview in "The Atlantic" magazine published Wednesday. "The president has also been critical of Fauci recently. During an interview Thursday with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump said,"Dr. Fauci's a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes.

## Another big medical group publicly supports Dr. Fauci--the Infectious Diseases Society of America

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/top-infectious-disease-experts-lend-support-to-fauci-after-white-house-attacks.html):

> The rift between Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Donald Trump widened last week after Fauci told the Financial Times in an interview that he hasn't seen Trump at the White House since early June and hasn't briefed him on the pandemic in at least two months. The Trump administration has increasingly disregarded advice from its top scientific advisors on Covid-19 with Trump himself calling the CDC's guidelines on school reopenings too cumbersome and expensive. Four former CDC directors wrote that the U.S. faces "Two opponents" in its efforts to reopen the country: Covid-19 and politicians and others attempting to undermine the CDC. "It is not unusual for CDC guidelines to be changed or amended during a clearance process that moves through multiple agencies and the White House. But it is extraordinary for guidelines to be undermined after their release," wrote the former CDC directors: Tom Frieden, who served under former President Barack Obama; Jeffrey Koplan, who served under former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush; David Satcher, who served under Clinton and Richard Besser, who served under Obama.
