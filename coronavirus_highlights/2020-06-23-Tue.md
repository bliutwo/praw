## The EU plans to ban US travelers indefinitely after haphazard COVID-19 response

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300747/european-union-eu-ban-us-travel-coronavirus-reopening-borders-draft-list):

> The European Union plans to ban travel from the US when it reopens its borders on July 1st because of the Trump administration's poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report from The New York Times. Members are being strongly encouraged to adopt it or else the EU may consider reinstating stricter borders within the bloc to prevent travelers from countries on the list from entering into one country with looser restrictions and crossing the border into another. Trump's most significant response was to ban travel from China in January and from the EU in March, but the virus has continued to spread through the US due to poor government coordination, planning, and messaging at the federal and state levels.

> Good.  Anyone who goes to Disney World right now is ridiculously stupid.  A bunch of Orlando restaurants closed today.   Then above the article I see this gem of a headline: "[DeSantis says ‘grim reaper’ will come for businesses that disregard coronavirus rules](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-the-knights-pub-alcohol-license-suspended-report-20200623-3um4fsgilrcmtpbaoq6c6you5i-story.html#nt=screamer) "    DeSantis is a moron.  He was in such a rush to reopen, and he downplayed the virus.  Now he's shocked that people aren't following the rules, when he didn't seem to be taking them very seriously himself.

## Texas governor to residents: "The safest place for you is at your home"

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-23-20-intl/h_b6d8c8740c6fc90b6f122a1e066a3768):

> The coronavirus pandemic is more likely to lead to a baby bust in the United States rather than a baby boom, possibly leaving the nation with about half a million fewer births than otherwise would be expected, experts at the Brookings Institution and nonprofit March of Dimes predict. "The economic and demographic implications that stem from a severe drop in pregnancies could have a tremendous impact on the next generation, which is why this is an important and very serious issue."According to the Brookings Institution, data from the recession suggests that the US birth rate dropped from about 69 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 in 2007 to 63 births per 1,000 women in 2012 - marking a decline of about 9% or roughly 400,000 fewer births. The Brookings team also found that in 1918, each spike in deaths due to the flu pandemic led an otherwise steady birth rate to fall roughly 21 births per 1,000 - representing a 12.5% decline.

## The WH is planning to end federal support for local coronavirus testing sites across the nation at the end of the month - including seven in Texas, where confirmed cases of COVID are spiking.

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/As-feds-ready-to-pull-support-for-testing-sites-15360900.php):

> WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is planning to end federal support for local coronavirus testing sites across the nation at the end of the month - including in Texas, where confirmed cases of COVID are spiking. Houston officials are urging the White House to rethink the move, warning of "Catastrophic cascading consequences" of pulling federal support for testing sites, including four in Houston and Harris County. "Losing the support of the federal government for testing sites will undoubtedly have catastrophic cascading consequences in the region's ability to adequately test, quarantine and isolate ultimately blunting the progression of COVID-19," Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and David Persse, the health authority of the city of Houston, wrote in a separate letter to Rear Adm.

> This is the pinnacle of insanity and I know people to say “there is no bottom”, but I don’t think it can get any worse than this. To cut funding for testing while the country is exploding with cases is.... I don’t even have any words for it. Insanity.
