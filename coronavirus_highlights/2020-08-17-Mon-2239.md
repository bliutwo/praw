> When Nurses And Other Health Care Workers Die Young From COVID-19 : Shots - Health News While most people who die from COVID-19 are over 65, health care workers who die are often younger. While COVID-19 takes a far deadlier toll on elderly people than on young adults, an investigation of front-line health care worker deaths by Kaiser Health News and The Guardian has uncovered numerous instances in which staff members under age 30 were exposed on the job and also succumbed. This story is part of "Lost on the Frontline," an ongoing project by The Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of health care workers in the U.S. who die from COVID-19, and to investigate why so many are victims of the disease.

`/u/gw2master` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ibk5cp/more_than_20_of_harvards_firstyear_students_defer/):

> The real reason for the deferrals is because one of the biggest plusses of Harvard is the networking and they feel you lose a lot of networking capability when classes are online.
> 
> Harvard should start its own social network, restricted to their students.  To jumpstart it, automatically add all those who would have been in your house (dorm) as "friends".
