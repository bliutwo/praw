> La caravana que realizó el Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores para repudiar la llegada de turistas a la Isla a través del Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Muñoz Marín culminó este sábado con el arresto de su portavoz, Ricardo Santos Ortiz, y con la imposición de multas de tránsito de $150 a decenas de manifestantes. El arresto ocurrió en momentos en que agentes de la Policía impartían boletos de $150 por obstrucción a la vía de rodaje a los manifestantes que aguardaban por poder entrar con su caravana hasta el aeropuerto. La gobernadora, en un tuit publicado esta mañana, reconoció el problema que ha causado la llegada de turistas luego de que se anunciara una reapertura del turismo para el 15 de julio y el 17 de julio se revirtió la directriz ante el aumento de casos de coronavirus.
