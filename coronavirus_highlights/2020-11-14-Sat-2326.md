## Study: Temperature checks, symptom screenings not very effective in detecting COVID-19 infections

Summary of [original article](https://abc13.com/temperature-checks-covid-coronavirus-symptoms-screenings/7922615/):

> A study of Marine recruits found that despite these measures and strict quarantines before they started training, the recruits spread the virus to others even though hardly any of them had symptoms. None of the infections were caught through symptom screening. Another 35 - an additional 2% - tested positive during the two-week military quarantine and only four had symptoms.

`/u/pluscell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ju9roi/study_temperature_checks_symptom_screenings_not/):

> I work in a place that has a couple thousand people come in every day, I'd guess.  We've been getting temperature screened every time we come in since probably July or August.  I recently found out that no one has ***ever*** been turned away (101+).  I guess it's okay in that it's telling people "Yo if you feel warm, don't even bother coming in", but it also seems like a waste of time and resources.
> 
> We've had 19 cases in total, also, so it's never caught them.

## The Dakotas are 'as bad as it gets anywhere in the world' for COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/11/14/covid-19-north-south-dakota-masks-kristi-noem/6237635002/):

> How widespread is COVID-19 across North and South Dakota?The current rates of infection and death in South Dakota and previously restriction-free North Dakota are what Dr. Ali Mokdad would expect to see in a war-torn nation - not here. It's a situation "As bad as it gets anywhere in the world," Dr. William Haseltine told USA TODAY.How did it get so bad? Mokdad pointed to a number of factors that have made both North and South Dakota vulnerable to the virus' spread. He cited higher rates of preexisting conditions and economic inequality in the region, in addition to health care that lags behind the U.S. standard. Widespread mask adoption and a serious commitment to physical distancing in the Dakotas can still save lives.

## Almost 40 percent of Americans say they are likely to attend a gathering of more than 10 people this holiday season

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/14/21565314/covid-thanksgiving-holidays-distancing-masks):

> A new poll conducted by Ohio State University has found that 38 percent of Americans say they are likely to participate in gatherings of more than 10 family members this holiday season, and a third would not ask others to wear masks at holiday gatherings. The findings, which come as the US is experiencing its third and most widely spread wave of coronavirus infections, suggest that millions of Americans may end up ignoring suggestions from public health experts on how to minimize their risk of transmitting Covid-19 during the upcoming holiday season. To help limit further spread, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the federal coronavirus task force, has recommended mask-wearing during holiday gatherings and cautioned against large gatherings - particularly if they involve people coming from regions where there are high rates of coronavirus infections.
