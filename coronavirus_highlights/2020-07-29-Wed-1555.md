> So either:
> 
> A) HCQ doesn't work against Covid-19 as shown by 5 published RCTs and 2 unpublished RCTs.
> 
> or
> 
> B) HCQ is incredibly efficacious against Covid, a "cure" so to speak.  The usage of HCQ is being suppressed by a vast international cabal consisting of thousands of scientists, doctors, government health agencies **worldwide** costing hundreds of thousands of lives solely to affect the outcome of the american election.  These doctors **worldwide** despite their oaths to do no harm are intentionally killing people just to affect the US election.   In fact if HCQ was widely used, the pandemic would end, costing this vast cabal their attempt at controlling the world.

> I don't know both options seem pretty plausible.  One option definitely doesn't seem as crazy as "Demon semen".  I'll never understand the mind of conspiracy theorists, I can't  ignore data and reality to follow some weird narrative that takes multiple preternatural leaps of faith to seem even remotely possible.

This treatment regimen did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1%, control vs. 5.9%, intervention; RR 0.75 \[0.32;1.77\]) nor shortened the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs. 10 days, intervention; p = 0.38).

> Of 491 patients randomly assigned to a group, 423 contributed primary end point data. Of these, 341 (81%) had laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed infection; 56% (236 of 423) were enrolled within 1 day of symptoms starting. Change in symptom severity over 14 days **did not differ** between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (difference in symptom severity: relative, 12%; absolute, −0.27 points \[95% CI, −0.61 to 0.07 points\]; P = 0.117). At 14 days, 24% (49 of 201) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine had ongoing symptoms compared with 30% (59 of 194) receiving placebo (P = 0.21). Medication adverse effects occurred in 43% (92 of 212) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine versus 22% (46 of 211) receiving placebo (P < 0.001). With placebo, 10 hospitalizations occurred (2 non–COVID-19–related), including 1 hospitalized death. With hydroxychloroquine, 4 hospitalizations occurred plus 1 nonhospitalized death (P = 0.29).

> 
> Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine **was not associated with reductions** in 28-day mortality but was **associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.**
> 
> RCTs almost perfectly control for variation between the tested groups.  The only difference between the 2 groups in a good RCT is the treatment.  Unlike observational studies that have unmeasured/unobserved confounding factors between the groups.  It's why RCTs are the gold standard in research.

> One of them ripped a face mask off one of the workers, who are typically known for their colorful Hawaiian shirt uniforms, according to the New York Police Department. Using a wooden paddle, typically meant to help direct the flow of traffic at cash registers, they began pummeling another employee over the head, police told NBC News.That worker started bleeding badly and was taken to a hospital, one Trader Joe's employee on the scene told Vice News.Carrero and Escobar were arrested shortly thereafter and charged with disorderly conduct, harassment and criminal trespassing, police told NBC. Carrero was also charged with second-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon, and Escobar was charged with menacing. One of them told a grocery store employee that face masks would no longer be required following the presidential election in November, Vice reported.

## A new study argues that school closures in the spring saved tens of thousands of lives from Covid-19 and prevented many more infections—resulting in up to 128.7 fewer cases per 100 000 population.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769034):

> This national study assessed the association between school closure and its timing with subsequent COVID-19 incidence and mortality, with the hypothesis that any association between school closure and incidence and mortality would be strongest in states that closed schools early when the cumulative incidence of disease was low. In the adjusted analyses during the period prior to potential effects of school closure, the relative change in COVID-19 incidence per week was 265%. The overall combined composite relative weekly change in COVID-19 incidence after school closure was 10%. This composite change after school closure is a combination of the changes associated with school closure and other non-school-related changes during the period after school closure and is visually depicted as the change after school closure in Figure 2. The observed death rates in each state by quartile of cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the time of school closure appears in Figure 1B. In the unadjusted analyses during the period prior to potential effects of school closure, the overall relative change in mortality per week was 171%. In the unadjusted analyses, the relative mortality change per week associated with school closure was −64%. The unadjusted effect size associated with school closure varied by COVID-19 cumulative incidence at the time of school closure, with states in the lowest quartile having the largest associated effect size.
