> Judging from the number of deaths in the US, no one there cares.
> 
> edit: Saying no one cares is definitely unfair.  There are people that care and I'm sure it's maddening for them watching the virus spiral out of control.

## Yale's COVID-19 saliva test used in NBA gets FDA emergency approval

Summary of [original article](https://www.today.com/health/yale-s-covid-19-saliva-test-used-nba-gets-fda-t189556):

> Federal officials have given emergency approval to a coronavirus saliva test that Yale University researchers used on NBA players and staff. In a statement, Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, called the test "Groundbreaking," partly because it doesn't need additional components, which have been prone to shortages, necessary with the standard nasal swab COVID-19 test. The authorization allows the test to bypass the FDA's regular approval process.

`/u/Tigerb0t` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ibcael/yales_covid19_saliva_test_used_in_nba_gets_fda/):

> This is amazing news!  This could be a game changer for allowing us to return to semi-normalcy.  Obviously big group events are still out but we might be able to visit family over the holidays if reliable, rapid, and cheap testing is available.

## The state of Texas is disclosing hundreds of previously unreported COVID-19 cases in El Paso and thousands statewide

Summary of [original article](https://elpasomatters.org/2020/08/15/el-pasos-covid-19-data-is-unreliable-thats-dangerous/):

> The Texas Department of State Health Services failed to notify El Paso health officials of almost 900 positive COVID-19 cases since late June, part of what appears to be a widespread data failure that may have led tens of thousands of cases statewide to go unrecorded in recent weeks. On Saturday, the El Paso Department of Public Health revealed 356 previously unreported cases from the prior several weeks. At this point, El Paso Matters considers El Paso and state COVID-19 data to be unreliable, so we're suspending our weekly analysis until the city and state can demonstrate that they can reliably collect and report important public health data.

`/u/Notsoexoticcarts` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ib5z0y/the_state_of_texas_is_disclosing_hundreds_of/):

> And they’re closing on, what, ten thousand deaths, plus all those new “pneumonia” deaths?
