> Indiana has about the same population as my home state of Victoria, Australia and as a result of this, I’ve been following our states progress closely. 
> 
> Waaaaay back in August we had a day here with about 700 new cases and 50 odd deaths. Indiana was about the same. 
> 
> Our Premier (Governor) instituted a severe lockdown when we hit those numbers: night curfew, closed shops, mandatory masks everywhere, single family members going shopping for essentials and you could not travel more than 5km/3mi from your home. 
> 
> Today we celebrated 44 days since our last community transmission and our restrictions are down to masks in shops only. 
> 
> With summer upon us we’re probably going to surf this low number all the way to the vaccine. 
> 
> It’s a tragedy, but an avoidable one.

## U.S. expects to have immunized 100 million against COVID-19 by end of first-quarter 2021: Slaoui

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-immunizations/u-s-expects-to-have-immunized-100-million-against-covid-19-by-end-of-first-quarter-2021-slaoui-idUSKBN28N0HH):

> 3 Min Read.WASHINGTON - The United States expects to have immunized 100 million people with the coronavirus vaccine by the end of March, the chief adviser for the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program said on Sunday. He said the United States hopes to have about 40 million doses of vaccine distributed by the end of December, which would include the just authorized vaccine from Pfizer Inc and one from Moderna Inc expected to get a similar emergency use nod later this week. For the United States to get "Herd immunity," which would halt transmission of the deadly virus, the country would need to have immunized about 75% or 80% of the population, he said, adding that he hoped to reach that point between May and June."It is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept to take the vaccine," Slaoui said.

> I hope y’all American understand that is an INCREDIBLE number. That’s just under 30% of your population, in Canada we only expect about 10% of people vaccinated in Q1 and 50% in Q2, and in the EU they claim a similar timeline as us but it appears that getting just Pfizer and Moderna for them will be about 4-5% by the end the Q1, so they need AZ/Oxford to get their shit together fast.

> If all goes to plan, y’all do owe OWS some credit.
