> The crazy thing about this is Mike DeWine is a REPUBLICAN!!!! Ohio is one of the the few states to react appropriately in the beginning, with 72% of ohioans approving of his response. Ohio legislature is insanely conservative compared to the state as a whole, mostly due to gerrymandering which allows ultraconservatives the run uncompetitive elections for the majority of the states legislature. Ridiculous.

> I watched this last night. It was very sobering. It also convinced my mother to not go to my sister's in-laws for Thanksgiving. So I'm happy about that. Then I got a text message from work stating that another employee tested positive for Covid. Sigh. Please, if you can, stay home. Because I'm worried that our hospitals will be full soon.
