Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/):

> It's been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight. I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it's been. Let's celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-leading-cause-of-death-united-states-this-week/):

> COVID-19 was ranked as the leading cause of death in the U.S. this week, with 11,820, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

> This week COVID killed 11,800 people surpassing heart disease (around 10,700). It looks like that gap is going to substantially widen if we don't turn things around ... And the Thanksgiving surge hasn't even manifested in deaths yet.
> 
> It deeply saddens me that so many people *just don't even care*. How is society just shrugging off this utterly preventable mass death?

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-doctor-s-license-revoked-over-refusal-wear-mask-during-n1250092):

> The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a "Common cold." The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.
