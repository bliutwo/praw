## Why Did We Ever Send Sick Kids to School? An overemphasis on attendance puts students’ health at risk and instills the value of working through illness. The pandemic has made it clear how dangerous that is.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/02/when-schools-punish-sick-kids-poor-attendance/618045/):

> Even as the COVID-19 vaccines offer a glimmer of hope on the horizon, parents like Wisner and myself are left wondering whether, after the pandemic, things will go right back to the way they were or whether schools will embrace what they've learned and apply it to prevent the spread of illness in the future. She's worked in public schools in the U.S., as well as private American schools in Abu Dhabi and South Korea. At Vosk's school, attendance taking is still being performed as best it can considering the virtual challenges of unreliable internet connections, turned-off cameras, and, at times, unresponsive students.

> I don't know if it's still done, but I remember "perfect attendance" being a reward during the end of year assembly. I can't imagine this being a thing going forward.

## Harris stresses teachers must be prioritized for Covid-19 vaccinations

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/harris-stresses-teachers-must-be-prioritized-covid-19-vaccinations-n1258087):

> WASHINGTON - Vice President Kamala Harris stressed Wednesday that teachers should be prioritized for Covid-19 vaccinations, but wouldn't say if she believed giving them the shots should be a prerequisite for reopening schools. In her first one-on-one live network interview since taking office, Harris was asked by "Today" show anchor Savannah Guthrie whether she could reassure teachers that it would be safe for them to go back to school even if they're not vaccinated. "Teachers should be a priority," said Harris, adding that teachers "Are critical to our children's development, they should be able to teach in a safe place and expand the minds and the opportunities of our children. So teachers should be a priority along with other frontline workers."

## UK approves world-first study to infect young people with Covid

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-trial-young-people-study-uk-b1803326.html):

> The UK has approved a first-of-its-kind study that will expose young and healthy volunteers to Covid-19 as part of efforts to further understand the virus, the government has announced. A Human Challenge study allows you to vaccinate volunteers and then infect them in a controlled way with the virus, to compare perhaps new vaccines with first-generation vaccines. A specially appointed independent REC has approved the study, and after reviewing the protocol, the MHRA concluded the virus characterisation study did not require its approval because the study does not involve an investigational medicinal product.

Due to begin in the next few weeks, the study will recruit 90 carefully participants aged between 18 and 30, and expose them to the pathogen in a safe and controlled environment. Medics and scientists will closely monitor the volunteers for 24 hours a day, the government said.

> 
> At least we now know those weren’t anecdote observations, but a real trend.
