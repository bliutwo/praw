## Pfizer begins exporting U.S. made COVID-19 shots abroad, starting with Mexico -source

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-pfizer-begins-exporting-us-made-covid-19-shots-abroad-starting-with-2021-04-29/):

> Pfizer Inc's shipment of COVID-19 vaccine to Mexico this week includes doses made in its U.S. plant, the first of what are expected to be ongoing exports of its shots from the United States, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The vaccine shipment, produced at Pfizer's Kalamazoo, Michigan plant, marks the first time the drugmaker has delivered abroad from U.S facilities after a Trump-era restriction on dose exports expired at the end of March, the source said. Pfizer has shipped more than 10 million doses to Mexico so far, becoming its largest supplier of COVID-19 vaccine.
