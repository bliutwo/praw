## Dr. Fauci Says, “With All Due Modesty, I Think I’m Pretty Effective.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.instyle.com/news/dr-fauci-says-with-all-due-modesty-i-think-im-pretty-effective):

> NO: I guess I'll start with the coronavirus task force! [laughs]. NO: What do you think some of the ethical issues are with COVID-19 that we are going to have to focus on? Starting with the issues around what do you do when a hospital gets to capacity and has no more beds or no more equipment? What do you do for health-care workers when they don't have adequate PPE and are putting themselves at risk? Issues around end-of-life care for people who are dying alone and there are no visitors allowed and no extra support for them.

## Dr. Anthony Fauci pleads with young people: ‘you’re propagating the pandemic’

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/dr-anthony-fauci-pleads-with-young-people-youre-propagating-the-pandemic.html):

> White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci urged young Americans to not take the coronavirus lightly, saying doing so could propagate the pandemic. Fauci said the average age of a new Covid-19 patient has dropped by 15 years since the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence warned last month that roughly half of the new cases in the U.S. were people under the age of 35, particularly in Florida and Texas. Fauci said young people at bars enjoying themselves is "Totally understandable." But he warned that young people who are asymptomatic, who never develop symptoms, can also pass the virus on to others.

## It's Time to Shut the Country Down -- and Pay People to Stay Home

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/its-time-to-shut-the-country-down-and-pay-people-to-stay-home/):

> "As Trump's re-election campaign has struggled to tear down former Vice President Joe Biden with less than four months until Election Day, the president's staff have devoted considerable resources to finding novel ways to make him feel better about the crumbling world around him," reports The Daily Beast. These were the actions that beat back COVID in the nightmare that was March and April, and did so with such success that the country barnstormed into the current crisis because it reopened too soon. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School argues that the most effective way to mitigate the economic damage from the pandemic is to save as many lives as possible, which means shut it down and keep 'em safe.

And yet young people all over the US continue to party and live it up without a mask because they keep thinking that covid is no big deal to the young people.
