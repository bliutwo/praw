## Antibody tests do not pick up people who had mild coronavirus, Oxford study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/antibody-tests-may-miss-people-had-mild-symptoms-coronavirus/):

> "You can see that below the cut-off, there is a rising proportion of people who report a loss of their sense of smell or taste, and this suggests that the test threshold is missing people with mild disease," said Dr Tim Walker, one of the study's authors. The study used several antibody tests, including the Abbott diagnostic, which is one of the four main commercial tests currently used in the UK. The results suggest these were around 11 per cent less sensitive than is currently believed - around 98 per cent - in part because the tests were developed using samples from symptomatic, often hospitalised, patients. The team suggested that samples from mild and asymptomatic patients with confirmed infections should be included in the evaluation process in order to investigate further whether mild illness is associated with a mild immune response - responses that are currently being missed by the antibody tests.

> I'm an ITU Nurse in a central London hospital that was one the major ones taking the first wave of covid patients.
> I worked non stop during the whole period, full PPE all the time, and I felt fine. Due to the first FP3 mask we were using I got really bruised on my nose, and during the day I couldn't breath through my nose. At the time I did lose sense of smell and taste, but that wasn't classified as a symptom yet, and to be honest, with everything happening around you, it kinda gets unnoticed. Last month we did the antibody test, and voil√† it came up positive, so apparently I contracted the virus.
> So after this covid-19 pandemic, not only did I get extremely exhausted, stressed, with constant insomnia (due to the alarms of monitors and ventilators in my head even at home), but I got a bonus of antibodies. And yet, even after all of this, there won't be ANY pay rise for nurses. Gotta love this country ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî

> As a teacher, I‚Äôm nearly in tears reading this article. I am very thankful to be in an area where the surge has come down - but how long will that last? He is right, so many people are indulging in a fantasy of a ‚Äúnew normal,‚Äù because the alternative (another year or more of being stuck at home) is awful. But how are people going to feel when teachers and kids start dying in their districts? My heart goes out to this man. He is in an impossible situation.

> Even if children don't get the same symptoms as adults they are super spreaders. They barely wash their hands, everything goes in their mouths, they need to be separated to protect the elderly and immunocomprimised.
> 
> And no, it is not the same as the flu, last year AT MOST the flu killed 64,000 Americans. Not. The same.

> People like this are pathetic, entitled children. Asking people to follow health safety rules in a pandemic does not make the country a totalitarian state. We need more people with authority that will clearly state that this kind of behavior is not acceptable. And then do something about it.

## ‚ÄòCoronavirus has stolen our future‚Äô: young people‚Äôs despair as jobs evaporate

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/02/coronavirus-has-stolen-our-future-young-peoples-despair-as-jobs-evaporate):

> Young people across Britain believe their future has been "Stolen" as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, with more than half fearing it has damaged their prospects. Rosie Carter, the report's author, said: "As we rebuild in the shadow of the pandemic, the government must prioritise young people - but without treating them as a single entity."The under-25s are a hugely diverse group and they will both experience and respond to these challenges differently. There is already evidence that the pandemic has exposed a generational divide in housing, with young people more likely to be locked down in smaller, overcrowded homes with no access to a garden than older age groups.
