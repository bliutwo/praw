> > The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be given from the age of 12. A study of 2,000 participants aged 12 to 15 was conducted in the United States. Health Canada relies on the findings of this study to grant new permission for Pfizer's vaccine. "The trial used the same two-dose regimen and the same dose of vaccine as those authorized for adults," said Marc Berthiaume, director of the Bureau of Medical Sciences at Health Canada. "The data from the clinical trial showed that after the second dose, the prevention effectiveness of COVID-19 in this younger age group was 100%," said Dr Berthiaume. The provinces will now have to decide how to conduct vaccination campaigns for children.

> 70% would require another 35.3 million adults to take the vaccine. With 61 days to go, that means 580,000 first doses per day (to adults) on average. 
> 
> This goal kind of tells you that the White House expects first doses to continue to crater, but it's still a worthy goal.
