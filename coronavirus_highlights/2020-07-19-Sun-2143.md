> Oxford University's coronavirus vaccine trial team is 'absolutely on track' and the vaccine could be available as early as September, David Carpenter, Chairman of the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, which approved the Oxford trial has said. Oxford's extremely promising breakthrough on coronavirus vaccine Researchers at the University of Oxford believe they may have a breakthrough in their search for a COVID-19 vaccine after the team discovered that the jab could provide "Double protection" against the deadly coronavirus following early-stage human trials, according to media reports in the UK. Blood samples taken from a group of UK volunteers given a dose of the vaccine showed that it stimulated the body to produce both antibodies and "Killer T-cells", a senior source from the trial was quoted by 'The Daily Telegraph' as saying. "The COVID-19 vaccine trial team have been working hard on assessing the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and preparing to assess vaccine efficacy," Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the university's Jenner Institute who is leading the research, had said back in May.

> I really hope so.  I know if the phase III trials successfully conclude,  they can start ramping up production in Sept.  I think realistically most people wouldn't be able to get it until Oct-Nov. at the earliest.   But If we could have a viable vaccine (even if it only offers temporary protection, or just makes catching it less severe)  before the new year.   That would be world changing.

> 
> Edit:  I understand the vaccine is already being produced. I meant more that once (hopefully) it is successful,  it can be all hands on deck to get it out to the world.  I no good with words.

There were even reports of scammers sellling industrial oxygen to desperate families who could not get medical attention due tu hospitals being at full capacity.

## Gov of Georgia is trying to get a gag order against Mayor of Atlanta for defying him and making masks mandatory.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/kemp-files-emergency-order-to-stop-mayor-from-talking):

> Kemp's suit is unique, Cunningham says, because Bottoms could feasibly argue that the order preventing her from mandating face masks is contrary to Kemp's declaration of a public health emergency. In Cunningham's opinion, to win, Kemp should have to argue that "Preventing the mayor from requiring the wearing of masks ensures that COVID-19 remains controlled." If the court agrees with this principle, Kemp may well lose the case, Cunningham says. Price says she's not sure Kemp will win because the court might not buy his argument for an injunction, which a court only issues if there's a threat of "Irreparable harm."
