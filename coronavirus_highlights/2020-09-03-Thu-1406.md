## Thursday Science Sticky. Coronavirus discussion only. No politics/policy. 9/3/20

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ilt0i8/thursday_science_sticky_coronavirus_discussion/):

> This sticky is strictly for discussing the science of the pandemic. The sub rule on politics will be strictly enforced as well as no policy discussion either. Please feel free to discuss anything pertaining to coronavirus that falls outside of those two categories.

> This might have been discussed before but I just wanted to ask about the misinformation about the Covid-19 deaths only being 6% from covid. It got brought up at work yesterday and I hadn't heard much about it.
> Edit: I did some research and from what I've seen it seems that 6% comes from people that didn't have any underlying conditions. Other than that it seems the other 94% of people didn't really die of covid as much as it made underlying conditions worse and succumbed to those diseases.

## Dwayne Johnson, His Wife and Daughters, 4 and 2, Test Positive for COVID-19: 'A Real Kick in the Gut'

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/movies/dwayne-johnson-family-test-positive-covid-19/):

> "I wanted to give you guys a little helpful update on things that have been going on on my end for the past two-and-a-half to three weeks now. So the update is this: my wife Lauren as well as my two baby girls and myself, we have all tested positive for COVID-19," Johnson began his video message, shared on Instagram. "Testing positive for COVID-19 is much different than overcoming nasty injuries, or being evicted, or even being broke, which I have been more than a few times," Johnson said, adding that the reason contracting the virus is so different "Is because my No.1 priority is to always protect my family. And protect my children, my loved ones." "Use me as your example," Johnson concluded his lengthy video.

## Robert Pattinson Has Covid-19, Halting The Batman Production

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/robert-pattinson-the-batman-coronavirus?utm_brand=vf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter):

> Robert Pattinson is said to have tested positive for the coronavirus, causing filming of The Batman to be halted just days after the superhero drama resumed work at studios outside of London. Would not comment on any individual worker's health, sharing only this statement: "A member of The Batman production has tested positive for Covid-19, and is isolating in accordance with established protocols. Filming is temporarily paused." Vanity Fair confirmed through a highly placed source that Pattinson was the individual who became sick. "It's a criminological experiment. He's trying to figure out what he can do to finally change this place. You see that he's charting what he's doing, and he's seeing he isn't having any of the effect that he wants to have yet," Reeves said recently at the DC Fandome event that revealed the new trailer.

## Africa's overall COVID-19 infection rate drops

Summary of [original article](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/africas-overall-covid-19-infection-rate-drops/1961892#):

> Africa has been witnessing an overall drop in the rate of infections from the novel coronavirus, says the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. East Africa region recorded a 2.4% increase in infections over the reported period, while North Africa registered a 7.5% rise. The continent has so far recorded 1,267,656 cases, 30,294 deaths, and 1,009,824 recoveries, according to the daily update by the Africa CDC. While declaring an overall fall in rate of infections, Nkengasong said: "We are not declaring victory. We have a long way to go to beat the virus in Africa."

`/u/Qaqk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ilrlz8/africas_overall_covid19_infection_rate_drops/):

> Quite likely. In South Africa, a survey of pregnant women and HIV positive people in the Western Cape province found 37% positive for antibodies. Despite an easing of lockdown 2 weeks ago, there's been little to no increase in cases.   Maybe   virus is struggling to find new victims. Will continue watching over next 3 weeks
