## BBC News - Coronavirus: Oxford vaccine can train immune system

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53469839):

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford appears safe and trains the immune system. This means the vaccine resembles the coronavirus and the immune system can learn how to attack it. Much of the focus on coronavirus so far has been about antibodies, but these are only one part of our immune defence.

> This would genuinely be one of the most phenomenal achievements in the history of mankind if a vaccine is out by September

> >“Our commitment to children and to families and to staff was that we would notify them if somebody was symptomatic or tested positive, and that we would notify them if they were in close contact within 48 hours,” Rivera said. “What became glaringly obvious to me on Tuesday afternoon when I had this phone call, is that we couldn’t execute any of that.”     
>     
> >Rivera said the delays in testing are not limited to Cobb County but are impacting the entire nation. In order to contact trace effectively and reopen schools for in-person instruction, the community requires expanded testing, a 14-day trend of decreasing cases and a drop in the positivity rate — the percentage of COVID-19 tests that come back positive.      
> 
> >[...]"My moral obligation and my moral responsibility is to acknowledge that we could be putting some people at risk,” Rivera said. “I’m not going to make a decision that I feel could potentially have someone lose a life because we prioritized an academic need over a staff or a student’s long-term safety.”
> 
> >Rivera said he wants to be able to look back on this decision and say it prioritized the wellness of students and staff.

## Oxford coronavirus vaccine is 'safe' and produces immune reaction, first study results show

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-vaccine-oxford-university-study-trial-result-covid-19-safe-a9628491.html):

> The coronavirus vaccine candidate being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University induces a strong immune response and appears to be safe, according to preliminary trial results. Researchers said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these could be reduced by taking paracetamol, with no serious adverse events from the vaccine. The American biotech firm Moderna, based in Massachusetts, was the first to announce that its vaccine candidate had produced an immune response within people.

`/u/deducing_conundrums` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/huloqh/oxford_coronavirus_vaccine_is_safe_and_produces/):

> I really hope manufacturing starts producing billions of doses as quick as possible. Even if the phase III trial shows that it doesn't provide immunity for longer durations, isn't it already shown to provide immunity for ~60 days already (based on Lancet report) ? Something that keeps people away from hospitals is of utmost priority right now.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-airborne/u-s-companies-fear-workplace-coronavirus-precautions-do-not-address-airborne-risk-idUSKCN24L17L):

> NEW YORK - U.S. companies are raising new questions about how they can make workplaces safe after the world's top public health agency acknowledged the risk that tiny airborne droplets of the novel coronavirus may contribute to its spread, industry healthcare consultants said. The slowdown comes as some employers, such as Texas energy companies Halliburton Co and Chevron Corp, had already begun delaying plans to bring back office workers due to rising coronavirus cases. Months after U.S. companies sent all but essential workers home due to the global new coronavirus pandemic, many are still struggling to bring their workforce back.

`/u/Midna0092` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/huk1le/us_companies_fear_workplace_coronavirus/):

> I'm pretty livid with my company. 16 people got it. did they send anyone home? Nope. 
> 
> I work for an IT company that sells cloud solutions all day long. The vast majority of us are fully capable of working from home. They just don't want us to because "efficiency."

## 'We need to close down' — Florida reports more than 10,000 coronavirus cases for fifth day

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/19/we-need-to-close-down-florida-reports-more-than-10000-coronavirus-cases-for-fifth-day.html):

> Florida reported 12,523 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, marking the fifth consecutive day the hot-spot state reported more than 10,000 cases, according to the state's health department. The Florida Department of Health says the virus has infected more than 350,047 people in the state and killed at least 4,982 people. Of the past ten days, Florida has reported more than 10,000 new cases per day on nine of those days, according to the state's health department.

`/u/kulltsb` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hua87z/we_need_to_close_down_florida_reports_more_than/):

> The good news it will never go above 10,000 or so in a day.  The backlog for results will just get longer and longer and longer and longer....
> 
> 
> edit: so now i get why after awhile people edit their top comments.  some people are taking this literally.  my comment is meant as a statement on florida being in the news all the time for doing shady things.  desantis has been doing everything in his power to downplay the pandemic.  certain republican officials want to stop testing as much.  it is a soft cap because the powers that be want it to be downplayed.
