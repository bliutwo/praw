> Doctor Pushes Back On Trump's Coronavirus School Reopening Efforts : Coronavirus Live Updates The American Academy of Pediatrics says children are better off in school but that the decision to reopen cannot ignore spiking infection rates. President Trump issued a forceful call this week for America's K-12 schools to reopen full time for all children in the fall, suggesting that Democrats want to keep schools closed ahead of the November election and even threatening to cut off federal funding to schools if they don't fully reopen. So all decisions really have to be made with public health and the school officials looking at that as part of their decision-making on whether they can reopen safely.

## With No End in Sight to the Coronavirus, Some Teachers Are Retiring Rather Than Go Back to School

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5864158/coronavirus-teachers-school/):

> About 20% of teachers said they aren't likely to return to teaching if schools reopen in the fall, according to a USA Today/Ipsos poll conducted in late May. EdWeek Research Center surveys conducted around the same time found that more than 10% of teachers are more likely to leave the profession now than they were before the pandemic, and 65% of educators said they want school buildings to remain closed to slow the spread of the virus. In Connecticut-where a union survey found that 43% of teachers think they're at higher risk for severe illness if they contract COVID-19 because of their age or an underlying medical condition-Andrea Cohen, who is over 65, decided to retire as an elementary school social worker. In the middle of an economic crisis that has left millions unemployed, including public school employees, many teachers aren't looking to flee the profession, despite their concerns about this fall.

## Your Mask Cuts Own Risk by 65 Percent

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/your-mask-cuts-own-risk-65-percent/):

> A range of new research on face coverings shows that the risk of infection to the wearer is decreased by 65 percent, said Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children's Hospital. "People who don't wear a mask increase the risk of transmission to everyone, not just the people they come into contact with. It's all the people those people will have contact with. You're being an irresponsible member of the community if you're not wearing a mask. It's like double-dipping in the guacamole. You're not being nice to others." "We do know social distancing reduces the risk of transmitting the virus by 90 percent, and wearing masks decreases the risk by 65 percent."

> OTTAWA - Canada handled the novel coronavirus outbreak better than many of its allies, including the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, in a rare public comment on the faltering U.S. effort. Canada - with a population one-tenth the size of the United States - has so far recorded 8,711 deaths and 106,167 cases and Trudeau said the situation was stabilizing, although some hot spots remained. Canada and the United States have blocked nonessential travel between the two nations since March and are discussing whether to extend the ban when it expires on July 21.
