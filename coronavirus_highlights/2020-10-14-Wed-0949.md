> I go to UF, it’s surprising how many people here don’t give a single shit about the virus. I see snap stories of packed clubs with no masks and frat/sorority parties every day. Whenever I go outside i treat it like i’m taking a trip to Chernobyl.

## Bill Gates slams U.S. on Covid: Most governments listen to their scientists, not attack them

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/bill-gates-slams-us-on-covid-most-governments-listen-to-scientists.html):

> Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates criticized the U.S. response to the coronavirus, telling CNBC the nation ranks "Quite low compared to other countries" in executing testing and delivering a clear message on safe social practices such as wearing masks. President Donald Trump, recovering from Covid-19 himself, has been dismissive of masks and even mocked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in their first debate for wearing them. "Mask compliance in the United States is quite poor. And yet the cost of the mask and the productivity lost from the mask, it's quite an intervention."

## COVID Cases since June by state partisanship

Summary of [original article](https://dangoodspeed.com/covid/total-cases-since-june):

> The numbers are the total confirmed normalized* cases per million for each state since June. A '10,000' means 1% of the state's population has tested positive of COVID since June 1. It works similarly when the total number of cases/deaths drops one day.

`/u/FoxxxyInHedo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jb090c/covid_cases_since_june_by_state_partisanship/):

> It’s almost like governments that listen to scientists and health experts fair better in the long run when it comes to combating a global pandemic.

>   
> Telling people not to socialize - especially their families, their support systems - for months on end is not realistic.  It's akin to instructing teenagers to not have sex.
>   
> Instead of prohibition, you have to give people the most accurate information as to what they can do to reduce risk.
