## FEMA asks Pentagon to ready as many as 10,000 troops to support nationwide vaccine push

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-pentagon-ready-10000-troops-covid-vaccination-sites/):

> The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked the Pentagon to ready as many as 10,000 troops to support 100 COVID-19 vaccination sites nationwide, with the goal of administering 450,000 vaccinations a day. "It is clear that additional vaccine will not be immediately available to support these sites, however planning will begin to ensure that sites are available when there is sufficient vaccine to support them," a spokesperson told CBS News. The administration is increasing the weekly supply of COVID-19 vaccines to states and territories by 16% next week and the White House has boosted its vaccine forecast to give governors a three-week heads-up on forthcoming allocations of the shots, helping them better plan distribution of the vaccine.

## Saliva Tests for COVID-19 as Effective as Swabs

Summary of [original article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/noninvasive-saliva-tests-for-covid-19-as-effective-as-nose-throat-swabs):

> Researchers say new saliva tests are nearly as accurate as throat and nasal swabs to detect COVID-19.They note that the tests are easier and less invasive than other exams, factors that could help increase the number of COVID-19 tests. Saliva-based testing has shown accuracy in detecting positive coronavirus infection 83 percent of the time, while nose-throat swab tests have shown 85 percent accuracy, according to a review of data from 16 studies including 5,900 participants published in JAMA Internal Medicine. Due to the differences between tests and test providers, some are available free of cost where others are discounted through certain insurance companies.

## Some rural Texans are driving hundreds of miles for COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://abc13.com/10171842/):

> As the state continues struggling with an uneven vaccine rollout, some Texans, particularly in far-flung parts of the state, have resorted to traveling hundreds of miles away from their homes, desperate to shield themselves from the virus that has killed more than 35,000 people in the state. People don't have to receive the second dose at the same place as the first, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against mixing and matching between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which differ among locations. Not all people living in vaccine deserts can afford to commute long distances to access protection from the virus.

`/u/zsreport` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9dfma/some_rural_texans_are_driving_hundreds_of_miles/):

> I don't blame them, it doesn't seem that mask wearing is very prolific in rural Texas. Or much of exurban Texas.
