## Antibody Study in Austin, TX Looking for Participants

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/irysr8/antibody_study_in_austin_tx_looking_for/):

> Greetings Reddit! We are here on behalf of Babson Diagnostics, a medical technology company in Austin, TX, who is conducting a clinical study about COVID-19 antibody testing at PeoplesRx Wellness Center on Research Blvd. We are looking to recruit Austin-area adults who suspect they may have had COVID-19 and would like to know their current IgG antibody status. A combination of commercially available and investigational antibody tests will be used. Participants will receive antibody test results from the commercially available test method, but not from the investigational test methods.

## Face masks could be giving people Covid-19 immunity, researchers suggest. Mask wearing might also be reducing the severity of the virus and ensuring that a greater proportion of new infections are asymptomatic

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/face-masks-could-giving-people-covid-19-immunity-researchers/?li_source=LI&li_medium=liftigniter-rhr):

> "To test the variolation hypothesis, we will need more studies comparing the strength and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity between people with asymptomatic infection and those with symptomatic infection, as well as a demonstration of the natural slowing of SARS-CoV-2 spread in areas with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections," she told the Sunday Telegraph. "However, it is true that the proportion of asymptomatic infection being increased by masking might increase the proportion of the population who achieve at least short-term immunity to the virus while we await a vaccine." "She added:"This is after all the response to a typical vaccine - where the recipient's immune systems are stimulated, subclinically, to produce protective immune responses to combat the infection if exposed at a future date.

> TLDR: People who wear masks are still exposed to very small doses of the virus.
> 
> These doses may not be large enough to cause symptoms but they could still be large enough to induce an immune response. So by wearing a mask and getting very small viral doses, you may actually build up immunity to Covid 19. This is an acedemic opinion piece in the NEJM, so its not a study but like an hypothesis from a noted expert. NEJM is one of the top medical journals in the world. 
> 
> As I said in another comment the proper term for this process is called inoculation (medical professionals usually use the term 'variolation'). this is how small pox was kept in check. They would take some pus from the open wound of a small pox patient, put it on a pin head and poke the arms of those who didn't yet have it. It was just enough viral dose to provoke an immune response. George Washington did this with his troops and it was one of the key to winning the revolutionary war.

> Law clearly states the fine can be up to that amount,  while he might only be 19, he's still an adult. I don't feel bad for anyone making this pandemic worse.

## 'I was dying with coronavirus in intensive care and now people tell me it was a myth'

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/health/familyhealth/i-was-dying-with-coronavirus-in-intensive-care-and-now-people-tell-me-it-was-a-myth/ar-BB18Yd9n):

> The 31-year-old from Newport was one of the first people to be treated for Covid-19 on the intensive care ward at the Royal Gwent Hospital - the first real epicentre of the virus in Wales. Half a year later, Lewis now finds himself arguing with people who think coronavirus is a hoax and dispelling myths shared about the virus by conspiracy theorists on social media. Lewis goes on to explain what happened to him while he was fighting the virus, and how it resulted in his intubation in intensive care.

> My brother is dead from a no win scenario spawned when he contracted Covid and when I posted about it, I was called  "A fraud, a spreader of false propaganda, a liar, a Russian operative and a dangerous radical". I totally empathize with this guy but they(the deniers) won't believe, until it is them or someone in their immediate family. Nothing we say will make any difference.

## More than 200 meat plant workers in the U.S. have died of covid-19. Federal regulators just issued two modest fines.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/osha-covid-meat-plant-fines/2020/09/13/1dca3e14-f395-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html):

> Meat plant workers, union leaders and worker safety groups are also outraged that the two plants, with some of the most severe outbreaks in the nation, were only cited for a total of three safety violations and that hundreds of other meat plants have faced no fines. The companies, worker safety groups and meat plant workers criticized OSHA for how long it took the agency to complete investigations of the plants. On the day the closure order was sent for the plant April 10, Pence and President Trump both mentioned the Greeley plant at the day's White House coronavirus briefing, promising testing resources to the plant.

> Poor meat plant workers left with no choice but to risk their lives for minimum wage, will not be recognized even as a sacrifice, 20k for 200 dead
