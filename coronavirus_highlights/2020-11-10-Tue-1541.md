> Texas here. I work crisis situations when the doc has died or gets COVID.  They called just this afternoon.  to see if I can work 350 miles away in the morning, as the medical director of the hospital has it.  I couldn’t do tomorrow so I’ve got a break until Wednesday. I’ll be working 24 hour shift on Friday into Saturday morning I then  get off and drive 4 hours to the next location, where I start at 6pm. I pull a 38 hour shift until Monday at 8, when I drive back to the first  hospital to start there.  I’ve been asked to eat on the way, that way I won’t need lunch.

> I have NO idea what I’m getting at these hospitals. I don’t know the morale  of the staff, whether they are using FEMA Nurses, how many have died or are sick.  I don’t know the EMR, the PPE situation or where the bathrooms are. I don’t know where I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether I get my own call room or if I sleep in an unused patients bed.  I’ve got TIDE pods and I can use the bathroom sink to wash my scrubs In.

Once the U.S. epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic, when new COVID-19 hospitalizations reached nearly 19,000 per day, New York had reduced that figure to just above 400. In recent weeks, hospitalizations in New York rose from 410 on Sept. 5 to 1,444 on Nov. 7, according to the state health department.

The second study, which looked at survival rates in England, found a similar improvement."
