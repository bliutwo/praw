> >> Missouri and Iowa, for example, advise that students exposed to COVID-19 don’t need to be quarantined as long as infected and exposed children are both wearing masks correctly – which goes against Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice to quarantine anyone who has had close contact with a person who has the virus.
> 
> Ah yes, I forgot the virus will magically leave their bodies much quicker. Must be them youths and their darn tootin’ fast metabolism!

## House opens investigation of pandemic ventilator purchases overseen by White House

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/27/automedx-combat-medical-ventilator-investigation-contracts/):

> Last spring, as part of its effort to increase the number of ventilators amid the crisis, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 11,200 AutoMedx SAVe II+ ventilators from Combat Medical Systems, which distributes the devices. The Democratic-controlled House subcommittee on economic and consumer policy, part of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, has been investigating the federal approach to ventilator procurement since mid-April, when a White House-led task force sought to quickly procure medical supplies as the virus spread.Widespread ventilator shortages never materialized. After the initial contract to purchase the AutoMedx SAVe II ventilator in March, several military doctors and medical personnel expressed misgivings about the appropriateness of the SAVe II ventilator to treat covid-19 patients in an email chain reviewed by The Post, raising broader concerns about whether the national stockpile received the right products.

> From [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/536120-house-panel-investigating-trump-administration-purchases-of-ventilators)
> 
> > The federal government signed a $16.2 million contract in April 2020 for the Department of Defense to purchase AutoMedx SAVe II ventilators from Combat Medical as part of an effort to increase ventilator supply.
> 
> > However, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) later found the ventilator was inadequate for treating COVID-19 patients.
> 
> > HHS then entered into a $62.5 million contract with Combat Medical in June to purchase AutoMedx SAVe II+ ventilators, which was supposed to be an improved model. However, the new model was also found to be insufficient for those hospitalized with coronavirus.
> 
> > “Reports and independent studies have indicated that the ventilators purchased by the federal government may not be appropriate for their intended purpose of treating COVID-19 patients, which raises serious questions about whether their purchase for nearly $70 million constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

> > HHS and the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 11,200 ventilators from Combat Medical, according to the Post.

> This was a screw-up of epic magnitude and a great big waste of taxpayer money. It should be investigated, and if anybody got a kickback, they should be prosecuted, and if the problem was merely incompetence, then we should know who was in charge of it and make sure they are ineligible for any responsible government job again. It wasn't just a waste of money, it cost lives. It's unforgivable.

> I just put 70% rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and carry that with me. And when rubbing alcohol was harder to get than toilet paper, I switched to hydrogen peroxide.
> 
> So I go into a store and I spray the handle on the grocery cart. I leave the store and I spray my hands.
> 
> Safe. Proven to kill Covid-19. Cheaper than buying hand sanitizer.
> 
> (Just make sure you use an opaque bottle for the hydrogen peroxide. There's a reason they sell that stuff in a brown bottle.)

## Nearly half of Americans want COVID-19 vaccine ASAP, numbers rising since December

Summary of [original article](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-americans-covid-vaccine-asap-december.html):

> Nearly half of all Americans want to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they can, a new poll suggests. The survey, conducted among more than 1,500 adults Jan. 11-18 and published Jan. 27 in the KFF publication COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, found that 47% of Americans want to get vaccinated as soon as they can or have already been vaccinated. People who know someone who has been vaccinated are more likely to want to be vaccinated themselves.

`/u/MinnyLakes` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l6anw9/nearly_half_of_americans_want_covid19_vaccine/):

> When having a high vaccination rate is tied into opening things up then people will want to do it and get the vaccine. Bottom line is the pandemic is on its last legs in the US. I suspect by mid to late March we will be in a very different place even though we will not have normalcy until maybe late April early May

> It's all politics.

> Anybody with a smidgeon of knowledge about virology could have confirmed that, while kids at schools weren't likely to get serious COVID-19 infections,  they would certainly act as a continuous reservoir and source of infection for adults. 
> 
> In the UK this was ignored on the alter of "Saving the Economy" and so we have a massively high death toll , and no obvious sign of the Economy having been saved.
