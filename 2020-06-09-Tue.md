It's not presently clear whether or not the New Jersey patient was symptomatic at time of partying, although the World Health Organization now believes that asymptomatic transmission of the virus may be "Very rare."

## Asymptomatic spread of coronavirus is 'very rare', says WHO

Summary of [original article](http://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html):

> Coronavirus patients without symptoms aren't driving the spread of the virus, World Health Organization officials said Monday, casting doubt on concerns by some researchers that the disease could be difficult to contain due to asymptomatic infections. To be sure, asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread of the virus appears to still be happening, Van Kerkhove said but remains rare. Correction: An earlier headline should have said most asymptomatic coronavirus patients aren't spreading new infections.
