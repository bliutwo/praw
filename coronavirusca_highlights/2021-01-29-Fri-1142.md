## U.S. handling of American evacuees from Wuhan increased coronavirus risks, watchdog finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/28/wuhan-americans-evacuation/):

> As the first American evacuees from Wuhan, China, touched down at a California military base a year ago, fleeing the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, they were met by U.S. health officials with no virus prevention plan or infection-control training - and who had not even been told to wear masks, according to a federal investigation. The "Most troubling finding" is that the government's handling of the Wuhan evacuees "Increased the risk of infection transmission not only to deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a whole," Special Counsel Henry Kerner wrote in a letter to President Biden on Thursday. In another striking moment, staff who attended a Jan. 30 "Town hall" with the evacuees said they were ordered to remove their masks and gloves, with witnesses suggesting that a senior official was worried that photographs of the garbed health workers - which some evacuees were posting on social media - would alarm the public and spark media interest.

> > Those are among the findings of two federal reports obtained by The Washington Post, supporting a whistleblower’s account of the chaos as U.S. officials scrambled to greet nearly 200 evacuees from Wuhan at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, Calif., in the early morning of Jan. 29, 2020. The handling and quarantining of those evacuees — the nation’s first up-close confrontation with a virus that has now sickened more than 25 million Americans — and the resulting whistleblower complaint prompted internal reviews by the Health and Human Services Department and an investigation overseen by the Office of Special Counsel.

The HHS report also concluded that the CDC must play a more formal role in providing infection-control guidance and handling future quarantines.
