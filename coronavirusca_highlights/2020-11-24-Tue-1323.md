## New stay-home order looms for L.A. County as COVID-19 cases soar to new highs

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-23/coronavirus-surge-pushes-l-a-county-to-the-brink-of-new-stay-at-home-order):

> The specter of another COVID-19 shutdown is looming over Los Angeles County, as a record-high number of daily coronavirus cases Monday pushed the region over its self-set threshold for issuing a new stay-at-home order. With Monday's numbers, the average number of new daily coronavirus cases over a five-day period hassurpassed 4,500, according to the county's tally - cracking the threshold that would trigger a new three-week order that, as described last week, would generally permit only essential workers and those procuring essential services to leave their homes. Last week, state officials announced a new order prohibiting most nonessential activity outside the home from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in counties that are in the strictest "Purple" tier of the state's color-coded reopening road map.

> No enforcement, no closing county borders, no clarification on what is “essential.”

> This fucking morons we call “public servants” have had 9 fucking months to figure this shit out and we are just going to repeat the same things we did that didn’t fucking work the first time.

## California seemingly corralled coronavirus. Now, cases are surging, hospitals are full and shutdowns are back

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/california-coronavirus-cases-surge/2020/11/23/98acb1e0-2cff-11eb-a189-497ad6817520_story.html):

> From Washington state, south into California and east to New Mexico, the coronavirus is carving a fresh path through already battered communities and economies, forcing a new round of government-imposed shutdown orders, curfews and mask mandates. The number of new daily cases statewide has doubled in just the past two weeks, and there are signs that more people are ending up in the hospital than during previous surges. Hospitals are straining with new cases, amounting to what Mayor Eric Garcetti called "a different kind of moment, a new level of danger" for the city.

> We were talking about this the other day, trying to wrap our heads around it. Even in Huntington Beach (Dumbfuckistan) I see almost 100% compliance to mask wearing in stores etc. Are people just worried about being filmed and shamed and wear a mask begrudgingly in public, are attending private parties? Is this the issue, people are going to private parties in numbers to make the whole of the 3rd floor at Fountain Valley full again?
