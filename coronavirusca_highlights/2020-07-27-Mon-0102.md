> >The celebration concluded and guests returned home, flying around the country. Within five days, many in the wedding party had begun showing symptoms or testing positive for the coronavirus, according to two guests who learned of the infections. None of the known cases has led to hospitalizations, they said.
> 
> >The guest who posted on Instagram about the wedding marveled at all the couple had overcome for the pandemic wedding.

> >“God was right there with her and (the groom) … whispering to them to ‘Press on. I’ve got this,’” she wrote. “This was the most beautiful wedding I have ever been to. Not because of the backdrop of where they got married, but because of the faith, love, patience, tears and joy that were evident throughout. He took care of all the details. When the photographer canceled the night before, He provided another. When the reception space canceled, He provided another one, better than the first. The caterer, the weather!”
> 
> Fuck. These. Absolutely. Self-absorbed. Piece. of. shit. Assholes. We *all* want to get back to normal. It's because of fucking Karens like these that we are still in this goddamn mess. It's this lack of any sort of perspective for anyone else but themselves that have caused so many unnecessary deaths. I'm sick of it. Meanwhile, many of us have also made sacrifices, stayed home, and wore masks. My wife and I are going stir crazy in our house. (Really glad we enjoy each other's company). We could be on the other end of this thing, but no. Too many god damn solipsistic fuckwads don't care about anyone else.

## MUNI bus driver in San Francisco attacked with a baseball bat over asking riders to wear marks

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/muni-driver-expected-to-make-full-recovery-after-attacked-over-mask-order/):

> SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - A San Francisco bus driver is expected to make a full recovery after being attacked with a baseball bat. On Wednesday afternoon - a trio of bus riders apparently didn't get the memo - or, simply chose to ignore it - and did not appreciate being approached by the driver who was eventually attacked. "Masks help protect all of us. Muni drivers are essential workers and, we will not tolerate these senseless criminal attacks. The District Attorney's office stands with muni drivers."

> Why are there so many cases of people getting violent when they’re told to wear a mask. It’s really not all that inconvenient. So many adult babies throwing temper tantrums.
