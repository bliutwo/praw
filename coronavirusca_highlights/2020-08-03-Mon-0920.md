## How the Pandemic Defeated America

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/):

> America has failed to protect its people, leaving them with illness and financial ruin. "Another whispered to me, 'I'm so relieved you're Black. I just want to make sure I'm listened to.' ". Black people were both more worried about the pandemic and more likely to be infected by it. The closest analogy is pregnancy, she says, which is "a time when women's lives are changing, and they can absorb a ton of information. A pandemic is similar: People are actually paying attention, and learning."

> “To avert another catastrophe, the U.S. needs to grapple with all the ways normal failed us. It needs a full accounting of every recent misstep and foundational sin, every unattended weakness and unheeded warning, every festering wound and reopened scar.”
> 
> I’m sure the current administration will get right on top of that.

## L.A. County's tracing team repeatedly failed to detect coronavirus outbreaks at workplaces

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-31/la-contact-tracers-struggle-to-keep-up-with-coronavirus-cases):

> To compensate for the system's weaknesses, the county now requires employers to report outbreaks when three or more workers test positive. In an interview, Ferrer acknowledged her staff has scrambled to keep up as they race to respond to hundreds of outbreaks across the county from a virus that scientists are only still learning about. The county rapidly boosted its core force of 250 contact tracers to 1,600 by reassigning and retraining other government employees, according to county documents.

`/u/SmarkieMark` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i2qdrw/la_countys_tracing_team_repeatedly_failed_to/):

> Contact tracing has been a joke. There are simply too many cases and too long of a wait for most tests for it to possibly be effective.

## How Moderna executives are cashing in on COVID-19 vaccine stock speculation

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-moderna-pay-insigh/how-moderna-executives-are-cashing-in-on-covid-19-vaccine-stock-speculation-idUSKBN2433AH):

> Biotech firm Moderna Inc could reap tens of billions of dollars in sales and stock appreciation if it wins the race for a COVID-19 vaccine. Many news outlets have reported sales by Moderna executives in the wake of positive news on its vaccine efforts. The news pushed Moderna stock up 20% to its peak of $80. Some scientists suggested Moderna should have held off publishing until it had all test subjects' results.

`/u/slaggyc` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i2svba/how_moderna_executives_are_cashing_in_on_covid19/):

> “In the meantime, the firm’s chief executive is pocketing millions of dollars every month by selling shares that have tripled in price on news of Moderna’s development progress, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows. The sales - by CEO Stéphane Bancel, his childrens’ trust and companies he owns - amount to about $21 million between January 1 and June 26, including $6 million in May.”
> 
> This whole thing just highlights how there’s so much wrong with pharma and CEO pay etc. Even a pandemic is all about the money.
