## COVID cases spur bill requiring employers disclose workplace outbreaks

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2020/09/12/investigation-bill-spur-california-employers-disclose-outbreaks/3462052001/):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom could arm California's vast agricultural workforce and local public health officers with more information about workplace coronavirus outbreaks under a bill that's on his desk. A monthlong investigation by CalMatters and The Salinas Californian uncovered reports of six outbreaks at seven companies that employ guest workers in four counties, sickening more than 350 workers. As the bill was heard in committee, Assembleymember Lorena Gonzalez, a San Diego Democrat who chairs the California Latino Legislative Caucus, said much of the state's nearly 14,000 deaths have fallen on Latino workers.

## Why hasn't California opted into Apple and Google's Covid Notification technology?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/irpwg2/why_hasnt_california_opted_into_apple_and_googles/):

> The new iOS update had features meant to use bluetooth technology to opt into covid notifications if a person close contact reported a positive test. The technology is not available in California yet. Our state hasn't met our contact tracer hiring target either.

> If I remember correctly, there was a concern regarding the privacy and data collection of California citizens. Instead of using Apple's and Google's Covid tracker tech, California instead opted to hire around 20,000 people to preform contact tracing.

> I used to be a gym rat but I'm very skeptical about this being effective even outdoors.  Won't masks will be less effective when saturated by sweat?  This will force more unfiltered air from the sides.   Equipment cleaning seems like it's going to be a nightmare.
