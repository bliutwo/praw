Counties across Northern California have also posted record highs in recent days, such as Napa County; Yolo County, home of UC Davis; Nevada, Placer and El Dorado counties, which sprawl from the state capital's suburbs to Lake Tahoe; and sparsely populated Mariposa County, home to Yosemite Valley. Over the last seven days, Southern California counties have reported 40 daily coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents averaged over a seven-day period.
