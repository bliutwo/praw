## Governor Newsom Signs Legislation to Ensure Access to Supplemental Paid Sick Leave for Workers Impacted by the Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/19/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-to-ensure-access-to-supplemental-paid-sick-leave-for-workers-impacted-by-the-pandemic/):

> Legislation creates uniform, statewide policy to ensure employees have access to COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave through September 30, 2021. SACRAMENTO - Building on the state's action to expand paid sick days protections for California's workforce during the pandemic, Governor Gavin Newsom today signed SB 95, legislation to ensure access to up to 80 hours of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave for eligible employees, including those advised to quarantine or isolate and those caring for COVID-impacted family members. "Under AB84/SB95, workers can rest assured they will be able to take time off if they or a loved one gets sick, need to quarantine or attend an appointment to be vaccinated. California's essential workers who have not had the privilege to stay home during the pandemic are deserving of protections that ultimately save lives. Combined with other initiatives implemented by the state to support workers and their employers, paid sick leave will help ensure California remains on the right track as we continue to make progress to safely reopen the state."

> Good for you for fighting!  Here are some additional steps you can take:
> 
> * Contact your local assembly person or state senator.  They have staff members dedicated to help constituents who've been screwed by the EDD or the FTB.
> * Contact local media.  Some have departments that help people get justice.  For example, in the Bay Area there is [7 on your side.](https://abc7news.com/7onyourside/?ex_cid=kgospddsa)
> * Vote out the guy responsible for the disaster at the EDD.  You'll get your chance soon enough.
