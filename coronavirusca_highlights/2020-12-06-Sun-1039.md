## A California pastor died of COVID-19 after his megachurch failed to comply with state health restrictions

Summary of [original article](https://www.insider.com/california-pastor-died-of-covid-19-after-megachurch-remain-open-2020-12):

> A California pastor died from coronavirus after his megachurch opened its doors despite restrictions of indoor religious services from state health officials, the Los Angeles Times reported. "So many of you have prayed and contended for his well-being and miraculous healing over the last week and half. It's been inspiring to watch our church family come together to contend for Pastor Bob and care for the Bryant family." Water of Life Community Church, which according to its website sees an estimated 7,000 people on weekends, opened its doors to the megachurch in late October, failing to comply with orders from California health officials prohibiting indoor church services to flatten the curve of COVID-19, according to the Los Angeles Times.

## So Christmas IS canceled, right?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7d9ob/so_christmas_is_canceled_right/):

> If I am reading the order correctly, since gatherings of ANY size are prohibited, that does effectively mean that all forms of holiday parties are off limits, AND typical Christmas gatherings that involve bringing multiple family member "Units" into the same home? Basically what they "Strongly recommend" we do at Thanksgiving is now mandatory under the order, is that correct? Regardless of whether or not people will follow it and cancel their family holiday gift exchange etc, that IS what the order means? Three weeks takes us to after Christmas. Also the leisure travel ban is telling people who fly home for Christmas to not go back to California.

> They can order people to stay home all they want but it won't matter because no one enforces it. I fully expect tons of Christmas gatherings anyway.

## You never wanted the truth

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7jmcu/you_never_wanted_the_truth/):

> "Death certificates are fake", "Hospitals are overcalling covid to make more money". "Every death is being called a covid death!". The only thing worse for the national economy than staying home for a month to get rid of covid spread is ignoring covid and the nation forced to stay at home all winter because there is no hospital bed for the sick.

> They're using a logical fallacy called moving the goalposts.

## Why So Many Americans Believe Obvious Lies About Liberal States (California under quarantine edition)

`/u/RandomDigitalSponge` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7ic7w/why_so_many_americans_believe_obvious_lies_about/):

> It’s yet another repetition of that same old trope that conservative media seems to relish in: life in California is hell. There are drugs on every corner. Needles exchanged on park playgrounds. Gangs rove the streets. Murder is at an all-time high. The government taxes everyone to death and people are leaving en masse because companies and jobs are moving smaller states where they aren’t taxed so heavily. Illegal immigrants are actively encouraged to drain our state coffers through welfare scams and our governor rules us with an iron fist.
> 
> None of that is true, but millions of non-Californians really want it to be true.
