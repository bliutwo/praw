## So Christmas IS canceled, right?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7d9ob/so_christmas_is_canceled_right/):

> If I am reading the order correctly, since gatherings of ANY size are prohibited, that does effectively mean that all forms of holiday parties are off limits, AND typical Christmas gatherings that involve bringing multiple family member "Units" into the same home? Basically what they "Strongly recommend" we do at Thanksgiving is now mandatory under the order, is that correct? Regardless of whether or not people will follow it and cancel their family holiday gift exchange etc, that IS what the order means? Three weeks takes us to after Christmas. Also the leisure travel ban is telling people who fly home for Christmas to not go back to California.

> They can order people to stay home all they want but it won't matter because no one enforces it. I fully expect tons of Christmas gatherings anyway.

> Is it a full on shutdown like the one back in March or the 20% of the capacity bs which we have now in LA?
> Cause whatever we have right now absolutely hasn’t made any difference at all. Same amount of people outside and same amount of line every where. 0 difference

> I understand the data on the graph, but have no idea what it implies. Can someone ELI5?
> 
> Edit: Ok. I believe I read an article on a similar topic. It supports the scientific consensus that covid is possibly a little worse a killer than the covid reported numbers due to deaths that go Uncategorized. I wasn’t sure if this graph was attempting to suggest something else.

## Why So Many Americans Believe Obvious Lies About Liberal States (California under quarantine edition)

`/u/RandomDigitalSponge` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7ic7w/why_so_many_americans_believe_obvious_lies_about/):

> It’s yet another repetition of that same old trope that conservative media seems to relish in: life in California is hell. There are drugs on every corner. Needles exchanged on park playgrounds. Gangs rove the streets. Murder is at an all-time high. The government taxes everyone to death and people are leaving en masse because companies and jobs are moving smaller states where they aren’t taxed so heavily. Illegal immigrants are actively encouraged to drain our state coffers through welfare scams and our governor rules us with an iron fist.
> 
> None of that is true, but millions of non-Californians really want it to be true.
