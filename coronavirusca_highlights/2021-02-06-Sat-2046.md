## California's next COVID-19 peril: Super Bowl as superspreader event. Can we learn from past?

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-06/super-bowl-risks):

> In L.A. County, the average daily number of reported cases - recorded by onset of illness or first positive tests - exceeded 1,100 a day on Oct. 12 for the first time since the end of August, when California began to reopen after the summer surge. If California had Arizona's death rate, California would have a cumulative COVID-19 death toll of nearly 78,000. The warnings from health officials follow the recent reopening of outdoor restaurant dining, which was shuttered across much of California for weeks as the winter coronavirus wave crested.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/A-California-school-district-reopened-in-person-15927588.php):

> Out of an abundance of caution, 81 elementary and middle school students at Escondido Union School District in San Diego County have been quarantined - along with 11 staff members - only two days after the district re-opened for hybrid, in-person learning, KNSD in San Diego first reported. Students only attend school in either four half-days or two full days.

## 2 UC Berkeley students test positive for UK variant as campus sees spike in COVID-19 cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/UC-Berkeley-genome-sequencing-UK-variant-15927344.php):

> Two students tested positive for a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus first detected in the United Kingdom. What's more, a significant number of the COVID-positive tests revealed a relatively new California variant called CAL.20C. Perhaps most troubling, one person who tested positive for CAL.20C in January of this year had previously been infected with a different variant of SARS-CoV-2, in July 2020, according to the university. Another troubling variant tied to Brazil and a third discovered in South Africa were detected last week in the U.S. and also are expected to spread. Based on scientific study, researchers believe the UK variant can spread up to about 50% more easily than the original strain of COVID-19 and may be deadlier, but more studies are needed to confirm this.

## Biden administration to deploy 1,000 troops to help COVID vaccination efforts

Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/health/biden-admin-to-deploy-1000-troops-to-help-deliver-covid-vaccines/10316484/):

> WASHINGTON - The Pentagon will deploy more than 1,100 troops to five vaccination centers in what will be the first wave of increased military support for the White House campaign to get more Americans inoculated against COVID-19. National Guard leaders told The Associated Press that they are now considering training additional Guard members to give shots, so that they can also expand vaccinations in more remote and rural portions of their states. Guard leaders said the close to 100 mobile vaccination teams already active are delivering more than 50,000 shots a day.
