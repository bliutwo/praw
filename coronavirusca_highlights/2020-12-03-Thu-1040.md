## California Sheriff Who Refused to Enforce Mask Order Gets COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sacramento-county-sheriff-scott-jones-gets-covid-19):

> The Sacramento Bee reports that Jones was infected by a co-worker and developed only mild symptoms. His office said it has been "Following all recommended personal safety protocols"-but Jones has not used his authority to make sure the public is doing the same. When the state imposed a mask mandate, Jones said his officers would not be enforcing it, referring to potential violations as "Minor." He also announced last month that he would not make sure people were abiding by Gov. Gavin Newsom's curfew as cases began surging.

> I’m getting kind of annoyed that the surprise stay at home order hasn’t been announced yet. Either say it or don’t, don’t leave everyone in limbo wondering for a week.

> SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gavin Newsom will hold a noon news briefing Thursday on California's response to the coronavirus pandemic and may announce further restrictions to try to slow the surging number of cases in the state. With California experiencing a caseload higher than its summer surge, Newsom said Monday that he was assessing whether to impose new restrictions similar to the March lockdown that prohibited Californians from leaving home for all but essential activities and exercise. Newsom said Monday that he would decide whether to issue another stay-at-home order for California counties in the purple tier, where the coronavirus is spreading most quickly and restrictions on public life are the most severe.
