> I'm not seeing where the article calculates the values for how many hospital beds remain. The values it gives for each state are the number of people currently hospitalized with Covid (that's what that CA number is) not the number of open beds. Then it gives the capacity as calculated in 2018. But it never subtracts the currently hospitalized from the capacity and adds them up in order to find the number of free beds in the country.

## New COVID-19 spike spreading beyond urban areas to all corners of California

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-27/most-of-california-now-suffering-worst-coronavirus-case-rates-on-record):

> In earlier phases of the pandemic, different parts of California could help harder-hit areas, like San Diego County and San Francisco taking in patients from Imperial County.
Counties across Northern California have also posted record highs in recent days, such as Napa County; Yolo County, home of UC Davis; Nevada, Placer and El Dorado counties, which sprawl from the state capital's suburbs to Lake Tahoe; and sparsely populated Mariposa County, home to Yosemite Valley.
Over the last seven days, Southern California counties have reported 40 daily coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents averaged over a seven-day period.

> Seemed super obvious and predictable that it would eventually become a big problem in the rural areas and basically ignoring it was shortsighted. Everything takes longer to get to the rural areas.

## Los Angeles County urges residents to stay home and bars gatherings of mixed households.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/27/world/covid-19-coronavirus/los-angeles-county-urges-residents-to-stay-home-and-bars-gatherings-of-mixed-households):

> Day camps as well as schools at the high school level and below must close for two weeks if they report an outbreak, which the county defined as three or more cases over 14 days.
At the Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest district in Virginia and 11th-largest in the country, an internal analysis found that the percentage of middle school and high school students earning F's in at least two classes had jumped from 6 percent in the first quarter a year ago to 11 percent this year.
"In some cases, the charter schools are taking them, in some cases privates and parochials," said Glenn Koocher, who heads the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

> K. They don't have any money for Covid relief. They sure as hell don't have any money to enforce any of this. People don't have any money because they can't work. Rich people probably couldn't care less. I was a big proponent of the first lockdown when they gave us a stimulus but now there is no choice but to open everything since we are not getting another one. People need to work to live since unemployment is just crumbs at this point.
