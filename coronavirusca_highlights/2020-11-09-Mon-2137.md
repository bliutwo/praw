> Sure they will. Yes, they’ll get moved to a more restrictive tier.  But, the half-assing of following the health orders, and minimal enforcement will not change. I’m jaded, in LA County, though where we probably won’t move to a lower tier until spring.

## Coronavirus is again stalking California, but there is still time to prevent a 'third wave'

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-08/is-california-headed-to-a-third-coronavirus-wave):

> Although California has started to see a rise in coronavirus cases, the pace of increase is slower than that seen in the rest of the United States, and experts said there is still time to prevent a third wave. The number of weekly coronavirus cases California has recorded recently is far below its peak. Texas on Halloween surpassed California as the state with the most coronavirus cases.

## Coronavirus: California's rates begin to rise amid US spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/09/coronavirus-californias-rates-begin-to-rise-amid-nationwide-spike/):

> Amid a dramatic spike in cases of COVID-19 nationally, California and Bay Area health officials sounded the alarm Monday after seeing signs of the virus re-emerging across the state. As the U.S. topped 10 million cases, California officials reported 7,212 new cases Sunday, more than twice the 2,981 from two weeks earlier on Oct. 25. Dr. George Rutherford at the University of California-San Francisco said "Most of the new cases are from the big Southern California counties, but all nine Bay Area counties had increases from last week, most of them in the 100-200 case range - so we're far from being in a position to point fingers."

> I still don’t understand how school, especially high schools are able to stay open when we go back to purple. Seems like a very reckless rule to me.

> Are you in a union? That would be my first stop. 
> 
> Yes, they can, they do not have to accommodate your work restrictions via WFH, they can provide other accommodations. Depending on your current Dr. note, they should be working with you through the ADA interactive process. 
> 
> If you have a doctors note, or can get another you can take unpaid leave and file for disability. It’s actually not that much of a hit from regular pay. 
> 
> As you know, 92% of the population is high risk and all employers are dealing with this and issue in a variety of ways, however just because you want a specific accommodation doesn’t mean they have to provide it. They need to work with you on options. However, if you can take a leave, that’s the safest route. Good luck.
