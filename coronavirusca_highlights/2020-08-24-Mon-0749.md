## Just got back from Oregon, California can learn a thing or two from them

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ifgeta/just_got_back_from_oregon_california_can_learn_a/):

> Things are allowed to be open but things are way more strict. Businesses are extremely strict about distancing and restaurants actually spread people out. It's no wonder they have less cases despite having more things open.

> The way it should work is to see that the R number has decreased enough before more reopening so that there is a buffer.
> 
> YES: R decreases to well below 1 --> reopen more --> R increases but still below 1 --> no additional reopening, increases mask and gathering enforcement --> R decreases to well below 1 --> reopen next phase
> 
> NO: R is barely below 1 --> reopen more, hope that R stays below 1 but fail --> roll back reopening and increase enforcement--> R is barely below 1 --> try to reopen again
> 
> Reopening should to be earned by first seeing that R is significantly below 1. Increased enforcement should come before any reopening is even considered. It's not "you can reopen but you also need to up the enforcement after you reopen." It's "you don't get to think about reopening until you have shown compliance."

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ifdy05/do_you_think_the_virus_will_get_worse_during_cold/):
