> Please please please get your covid vaccine. It will save lives. If there is a need for a bed for someone who had a non covid medical emergency there might not be a bed for them.

> Get it for the community you live in.

> Rural/ Urban divide - being replayed in most states.  It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine the politics of these areas that are suffering.  It is indeed a shame, but predictable based on what has been happening across the country.

## This question is not exactly about COVID but I feel it relates to the Pandemic... I’m just wondering if the regular Flu virus will ever make a comeback? It seems that all of the COVID precautions have severely reduced the number of cases of the common seasonal flu.

I'm just wondering if the regular Flu virus will ever make a comeback? It seems that all of the COVID precautions have severely reduced the number of cases of the common seasonal flu. Virus pushes some California hospitals near ICU capacity.

> Flu isn’t going anywhere just because people are masking up. It’s not gonna magically go extinct. It’ll make a comeback (whenever that is, who knows?)

## The health care organization I work for does not recognize religious beliefs as an exemption, so a few of my co-workers are applying to other health care orgs in Orange County, CA. Also, what is a Pine Tree Detox?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pjum7z/the_health_care_organization_i_work_for_does_not/):

> The VPs forwarded a "Medical Exemption from COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement" form for the non-vaccinated employee's primary care physician to fill out. Our company does not accept religious beliefs as an exemption, hence why it's not listed in the form. Are any of you aware of health care companies, or health care organizations that do not require their employees get the COVID vaccine?

`/u/keninsd` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pjum7z/the_health_care_organization_i_work_for_does_not/):

> I'm glad to read of this policy. It seems to be working as intended for at least one of your coworkers. "The other two are resisting, and they believe wholeheartedly they are standing up for what's right." What's right is finding the parts of their bible that talks more about helping others and being compassionate rather than the selfishness and stupidity that their religion seems to be promoting.
> 
> If you are also religious, perhaps you can find those passages to remind them that religion is not for the selfish.

## California Faces Short-Term Nursing Shortage from COVID-19 Retirements

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/09/421366/california-faces-short-term-nursing-shortage-covid-19-retirements):

> The authors estimate a current shortage of 40,567 full-time equivalent RNs, a 13.6 percent gap, that is projected to persist until 2026, according to an analysis of preliminary data from the 2020 Survey of California Registered Nurses and final data from the 2019-20 Annual RN Schools Survey. At a time when hospitals nationwide are facing challenges in filling nursing positions, the study found that many older registered nurses in California have left the field and a large number plan on retiring or quitting within the next two years. California currently has more than 350,000 registered nurses employed in its hospitals, clinics and other facilities, as well as more than 450,000 licensed nurses.

> MAny of these health  professionals worked in the ICU and ER‘s with the first wave of Covid they’re suffering from PTSD and now we have the Delta variation filling us up again because of unvaccinated people and their employers are not giving them the support they need I mean basically this was Workmen’s Comp. issues and they’re kind of saying oh well if you can’t work the ICU or ER goodbye…
