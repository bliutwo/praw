> I think some stores might just be having a hard time balancing between stocking shelves, pickup, and delivery. 
> 
> Went into Whole Foods in Bay Area and shelves were empty of meats, coffee, pitiful vegetable selection. I went on the prime app for that store, picked everything out that was empty shelved and got a drive up pick up for those items a few hrs later. So they were somewhere in the store, just not on the shelves in front of me.
