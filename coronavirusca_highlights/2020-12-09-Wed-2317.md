> Vacation travel to Lake Tahoe will be banned for at least three weeks starting Friday due to a regional rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations. "Unfortunately, yet again, Tahoe is closed," said Chris Fiore, communications manager for the city of South Lake Tahoe.

## Infected after 5 minutes, from 20 feet away: South Korea study shows coronavirus’ spread indoors

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-12-09/five-minutes-from-20-feet-away-south-korean-study-shows-perils-of-indoor-dining-for-covid-19):

> The study - adding to a growing body of evidence on airborne transmission of the virus - highlighted how South Korea's meticulous and often invasive contact tracing regime has enabled researchers to closely track how the virus moves through populations. "There's a real misconception about this in the public," said Seung, who was not involved in the South Korea study. The study was published at a time when South Korea, like many other countries, is on edge amid a new wave of coronavirus infections, with daily case rates hovering around 600 in recent days.

The LA County health director urged parents to take precautions at playgrounds and avoid them altogether if the spaces are too crowded.
