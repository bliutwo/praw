## Coronavirus surge in L.A. County shows some signs of slowing, but dangers remain

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-06/la-covid-surge-pace-slows-after-mask-vaccine-mandates):

> Over the week ending July 22 - a period that includes the first few days of the new mask mandate - L.A. County reported an average of roughly 1,940 new coronavirus cases per day, an increase of 80% from the week before, according to data compiled by The Times. In the weeks since, governments and private sector employers have increasingly turned not just to masks, but new vaccine requirements. From July 25 to 31, providers throughout California administered an average of nearly 44,000 first vaccine doses per day: a 41% increase from two weeks ago, Times data show.

> mad props to LA County Health and Dr. Ferrer for leading the charge in the face of Delta. She was widely criticized as being over-reactionary and anti-science, even to the point of accusing her of having socio-political motivations, when they instituted the mandate for face coverings indoors again. But it's proven to help slow the spread, especially now that we realize how contagious Delta really is. My only aggravation with this whole surge is that we coddled the anti-vax/vaccine-hesitant crowd for way too long. We treated them with kid gloves and accommodated their "choice", as if their actions wouldn't have any impact on the surrounding community, especially our health system.

> We should approach this logically. Clothes are a way bigger piece of cloth than masks, so the government has been violating our freedom way more this whole time. Remove the clothes requirement first, masks can come after.

## How is your School Handling Covid?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/oyodjq/how_is_your_school_handling_covid/):

> We called our middle school and they basically don't have a plan for Covid. Kids vaccination rates are definitely going to > 50% before school starts. What are your schools doing to make you feel safe enough to send your kids back to a school?

> Not much. During orientation they said class sizes for 1st-3rd grade will be as high as prepandemic levels - 26-35kids in a class. Masks required indoors but not out. Such a cluster.
