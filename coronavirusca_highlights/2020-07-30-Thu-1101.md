## Gov. Newsom withholds coronavirus money from 2 defiant cities

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/california-withholds-virus-money-from-2-defiant-cities):

> SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gavin Newsom is using new powers to withhold money from two cities in California's Central Valley that are defying his health orders by allowing all businesses to open during the pandemic. Newsom blocked nearly $65,000 from Atwater in Merced County and more than $35,000 from Coalinga in Fresno County, the first installments of $2.5 billion in federal funds that cities and counties across the state risk losing if they don't toe the line on coronavirus safeguards. The state's Office of Emergency Services sent letters to the cities last week notifying officials that they risked losing more money if they didn't withdraw resolutions defying the state's orders.

> Good, actions have consequences and when they have public health consequences the hammer must fall hard.

> Chaos and the Coronavirus Ep 6 is about the senseless murder of George Floyd, the coronavirus pandemic, the shock waves of chaos this murder has sent around the country, and how all of these 2020 related events have affected our home in New York City. In our view, all of these events share an inextricable link, and through our video you will get to vicariously experience my world through a New York City resident's lens.

## All California counties now have coronavirus cases as Modoc County confirms first 2

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/all-58-counties-in-california-have-reported-cases-of-coronavirus-as-modoc-county-reports-first-2):

> Modoc County, in California's far northeast corner, reported its first two COVID-19 infections Tuesday, which means that all 58 counties in the state have now confirmed at least one case of coronavirus. As cases surged throughout the state and ravaged nearby counties in Northern California, Modoc had remained untouched by the virus and, at times, defied state safety orders. Los Angeles County is one of the more than 30 counties the state is monitoring for surges in cases and hospitalizations.
