## SF police record ‘alarming’ spike in COVID-19 cases among officers

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-police-record-alarming-spike-in-covid-19-cases-among-officers/):

> San Francisco police have recorded an "Alarming" spike in officers testing positive for the coronavirus as cases more than doubled in the last week alone after a possible outbreak at the Police Academy. Thirty officers have tested positive for COVID-19 since last Monday, in a sharp jump from the prior five months when 22 officers were confirmed to have the illness, according to new numbers from the San Francisco Police Department. "We are concerned by the uptick in positive COVID cases and appreciate the department working to ensure officers are equipped with the appropriate PPE and sanitation supplies," Montoya said.

> Well, I can’t speak for SFPD. But I can for the LAPD. A lot of those fuckers don’t wear masks.

## Orange County removed from state coronavirus watch list

Summary of [original article](https://www.ocregister.com/orange-county-removed-from-state-coronavirus-watch-list):

> Orange County on Sunday was removed from the state's watch list of counties hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, punctuating weeks of improvement from a surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in July. On Sunday, Dr. Clayton Chau, Orange County's Health Care Agency director and acting health officer, said he was confident Orange County would keep off the watch list over the 14-day window. Marc Meulman, chief of operations for the county's Public Health Services, said Friday that Orange County had met all the state's goals drafted when it was added to the watch list in June, though there is no report that details Orange County's performance on eight "Key action steps," including rolling out more testing sites and new community outreach programs.

> Being removed from the watch list doesn’t mean shit, it’s basically just letting certain industries to partially reopen business without being constricted to being on the list anymore.

> Bet in a few weeks, O.C. will probably get put back on the watch list.
