> This is required in our district as well and it’s because a few teachers ruined it for everyone. When schools went remote in the spring, the “few” went totally MIA on their classes - no check in, no teaching, nothing. I could excuse that behavior because it was a weird, scary time, except those same teachers were posting pictures of themselves on social media having wine nights together, going to the beach together, etc etc. So now the district doesn’t trust any of the teachers and everyone, including admin, has to be at the school every day.

## COVID-19 cases spike in California after holidays. Spread linked to family gatherings

Summary of [original article](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/health/2020/08/02/covid-19-spike-california-after-july-4-linked-family-gatherings/5545884002/):

> Since July 4, 37 of the state's 58 counties have seen case counts at least double, especially in more rural counties and those in the Central Valley, according to California Department of Public Health data analyzed by The Desert Sun. "There are not sufficient data to assess the impact of July Fourth festivities," a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Desert Sun.Asked whether the holiday contributed to the surge, Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at UC Irvine, answered, "Yes. But." With the state and the country moving in fits and starts toward reopening, numerous factors come into play. Intimate gatherings are drivers of new casesCounty health officials throughout California are increasingly reporting that close social gatherings and spread of the virus within a household are larger drivers of transmission than tourism.

> News like this is why I told my family that I would not be attending any birthday or social gatherings for the time being. I work in a public facing role and although I may feel fine, the risk of bringing this virus to my family is far too risky.
