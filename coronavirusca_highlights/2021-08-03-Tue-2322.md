## SF General Hospital to give supplemental mRNA vaccine to people who got J&J shot

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/10926455/?ex_cid=TA_KGO_FB&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A%20Trending%20Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR2wgSDXmkOJaOxxD5dCbXCwd8eEmGqQcheHcO3pE5hurfen8MJWQ8gz-Lo):

> SAN FRANCISCO - Even though the CDC is not recommending a booster shot at this time, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and San Francisco's Department of Public Health have decided to allow an extra coronavirus vaccine for people who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. "It's not a booster because it's not specific for some of the variants, which the booster ultimately will be," said Dr. Chris Colwell, chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General. San Francisco General is prioritizing City residents, but Dr. Winston says as long as their clinic has space and adequate vaccine supply, they will give the mRNA supplement to people from other counties.

> I got the J&J back in April and am debating this. The J&J side effects hit me hard so I expect this too as well. But my roommate at the time, who also got the J&J, just got covid last week and it seemed to hit him pretty hard despite being young and healthy. 
> 
> My one worry is this weird data state might break some of the vaccine verification databases. Not having a second dose of the mRNA may look like I have not completed the series and the auto verification systems could get confused.

## California Covid Cases Up 50% Since Thursday As Evidence Mounts Of Rapid Spread Among Kids

Summary of [original article](https://deadline.com/2021/08/california-covid-cases-up-fifty-percent-spread-among-kids-1234807685/):

> That 10% rise on Monday followed a 39% one-day rise from Thursday to Friday of last week, making for a total 49-plus percent rise in new cases since just Thursday. The 11-school Brentwood district confirmed at least 15 positive Covid cases among its students and staff just three days into the new school year. While cases among kids are most often mild, a more rapid spread due to the Delta variant - and the possibility of new variants popping up as the virus mutates among new hosts - is not a pretty picture for kids or parents, who've already been through a year of pandemic worries, not to mention homeschooling.

`/u/beaniebabycoin` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/owtc0l/california_covid_cases_up_50_since_thursday_as/):

> Before we're reminded about how relatively safe children are, let's just highlight how parents are being totally left out to dry this time around.
> 
> Any precautions from last year are out the window because schools need to function as daycare for workers, and people who profit of workers will shut down any pushback.
> 
> The long term societal gains of protecting children are being torched for short term solutions to keep profit flowing upwards.

> Bay Area officials said the delta variant is infecting a "Small percentage" of vaccinated Bay Area residents but they are still strongly protected against severe illness, hospitalization and death.

## Community colleges offer cash, textbooks to students who get vaccinated â€” While both the University of California and California State University are requiring students to be vaccinated for the fall term, community college districts are opting for a mix of mandates, incentives and encouragement.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/college-beat-higher-education/2021/08/california-community-colleges-vaccination-incentives/):

> In an effort to increase vaccination among its 250,000 students, the Los Angeles Community College District offered $75 to each student who got vaccinated at two campus events - one July 21 at LA Mission and another at Los Angeles Valley College on July 31. The California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office released an advisory strongly urging all community college districts to adopt vaccination mandates, citing the surge in COVID-19 cases fueled by the Delta variant. San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton considered a return to campus plan that required vaccination, but trustees voted against the mandate in a July 6 board meeting after community members voiced concern about the safety of the vaccine and a timeline requiring that students be vaccinated by August 13.

## At some California hospitals, nearly half of workers remain unvaccinated

Summary of [original article](https://www.ocregister.com/2021/08/01/at-some-california-hospitals-nearly-half-of-workers-remain-unvaccinated):

> At Kaiser Foundation Hospital Riverside, 29%. Officials said about 30% of employees at Los Angeles County hospitals - including "Safety net" facilities that care for uninsured and underinsured patients - were still unvaccinated, though federal figures put the unvaccinated rate far closer to 50% at County USC Medical Center in Los Angeles and County Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, and at 38% at County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance. Enough large hospitals confirmed the numbers to support an overarching conclusion: Hospital workers are people, too, and a great many of them remain unvaccinated, despite their labor in health care facilities treating patients in fragile conditions. Hesitancy inside hospitals underscores the rationale for requiring vaccination for health care workers and a broad cross-section of other public-facing workers - but there will still be many fights ahead. COVID-19 infections.
