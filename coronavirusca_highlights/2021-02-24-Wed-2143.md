> Our numbers wouldn't be dropping like they are if the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines weren't effective against this strain.  It's all around CA now....numbers are plummeting.  Effectiveness is probably reduced but we should still be able to get this under control and manage any outbreaks w/ proper contact tracing (that was never done last year).

## Coronavirus: California's recovery continues to outpace nation

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/24/coronavirus-californias-recovery-continues-to-outpace-nation):

> California recorded a 52% decline in cases over the past two weeks, outpacing the nation as well as its own previous two-week period. With more than 2,300 deaths over the past week, California has still recorded more than twice as many recent fatalities as any other state; only Texas and Florida reported 1,000 or more deaths in that time. With 153 fatalities Tuesday, Los Angeles County reported more new deaths than the combined total of all the other counties in California.

`/u/WrongTemporary8` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lrknrp/coronavirus_californias_recovery_continues_to/):

> I'm cautiously optimistic that California will be looking significantly recovered by May and by summer things will be relatively normal. I can't wait to go to the movies and theme parks again. Also museums too, I feel like I never fully appreciated the wide variety of museums CA had until they were closed.

## Pandemic Exit Interviews: Stop panicking about the COVID-19 variants, says UCSF's Monica Gandhi

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/COVID-19-variants-vaccines-effective-San-Francisco-15961073.php):

> As things continue to wind down, we're starting a series called "Pandemic Exit Interviews" - a weekly series with a person of local interest who played a central role in the pandemic. Dr. Monica Gandhi is not your typical epidemiologist in the era of COVID-19. While the vast majority of experts in her field call for the most stringent business closures and other mitigation measures, Gandhi - a professor of medicine at UCSF - has called for a "Harm reduction" approach that also considers other risks beyond COVID-19 infection when making public policy.

`/u/CasualPenguin` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lrgqak/pandemic_exit_interviews_stop_panicking_about_the/):

> So called 'harm reductionists' seem to forget we could be in a mentally healthier, closer to normal, and safer place on the other side of lock downs if people would have committed to them.
> 
> Meanwhile look at Australia, Victoria has 13 or so TOTAL cases (coming from a quarantine site) so they went back in to lockdown for 5 days and then boom back to business as usual.  People safely spending time together, meanwhile idiots in US complain when the superbowl can only have 50% capacity while florida has 10,000 plus DAILY cases
> 
> America has chosen to value the stock market over american lives.

## False claims in texts, emails led to misuse of vaccine codes intended for those in need

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-24/false-claims-in-texts-emails-misuse-of-vaccine-codes-intended-for-those-in-need):

> State officials asked community groups - among them nonprofits, faith-based groups, labor unions - to circulate the codes to their members for appointments at the sites in Oakland and L.A. But those codes also began circulating in emails and group texts among the wealthier, work-from-home set in Los Angeles who were not yet eligible for the vaccine. Many people who used the access codes said they didn't know they were doing anything wrong, and said they would not have signed up if they had known the codes had been earmarked for more vulnerable residents. Some providers have already adjusted their plans based on the propensity for the codes to spread. In Alameda County, school officials decided not to circulate the access codes when they hosted a FEMA mobile vaccination clinic in Hayward last week, according to Alameda County Office of Education spokesperson Michelle Smith McDonald.

## FDA says Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine meets requirements for emergency use authorization

`/u/mrsblanchedevereaux` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lrdxy9/fda_says_johnson_johnson_covid19_vaccine_meets/):

> Previously it was sounding like this version would be administered to healthy adults in the low exposure / low risk group, but I’m wondering what that actually means. I’m thankful that vaccines are available at all, but the efficacy (which appears to fade pretty quickly) does not make me excited for the people in my life who may only have access to this version.
