## 43 staffers infected at Kaiser emergency room in San Jose, and inflatable Christmas costume could be to blame

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/43-staffers-infected-at-Kaiser-emergency-room-in-15842340.php):

> A coronavirus outbreak at the Kaiser Permanente San Jose Emergency Department, possibly caused by an inflatable Christmas costume, has affected 43 staff members so far, all of whom tested positive within the past week, officials said. "A staff member did appear briefly in the emergency department on Dec. 25th wearing an air-powered costume," said Irene Chavez, senior vice president and area manager of Kaiser's San Jose Medical Center, in a written response to Chronicle questions. The San Jose Medical Center - and the Emergency Department - remain open, with additional staffing in place to handle an increase in COVID cases in the ER and hospital, Chavez said.

> Who thought wearing an inflatable costume (which has fans and an outflow port which circulate air around the wearer and into the environment) at a hospital during an airborne pandemic would be a good idea?

## 2 cases of new, apparently more contagious coronavirus strain detected in Big Bear area

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/2-cases-of-new-apparently-more-contagious-coronavirus-strain-detected-in-big-bear-area/):

> A new, apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first reported in the United Kingdom has been detected in the Big Bear area, health officials said Friday. Fauci said there's no indication the new strain is more harmful, and added that it appears the current COVID-19 vaccines should be effective in fighting it. Still, the new variant caused alarm and dozens of countries in Europe and beyond have restricted travel from the U.K. California is finding cases of the possibly more infectious strain while it deals with an unprecedented coronavirus surge that has already overwhelmed hospitals and some mortuaries.

> Here in Trumpland (Big Bear) we believe that COVID-19 is a hoax, so come on up all you touristas and bring your money to our restaurants, hotels, and resort businesses. It's perfectly safe to go without a mask or socially distance, even indoors. It's beautiful.

## LA County reports 20,414 more COVID cases; LASD raids 5 'super-spreader' New Year's Eve parties

Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/la-county-covid-update-cases-covid-19-covid19/9273591):

> Conditions continue to worsen at hospitals in the county, with ambulances waiting up to eight hours to off-load patients, leading to a shortage of paramedic crews on the streets and longer 911 response times. "A special task force of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department conducted raids on five New Year's Eve"super-spreader'' parties across the county, making over 90 arrests and taking seven handguns off the streets, officials said Friday. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer noted that 86% of people who have died from COVID-19 in the county had underlying health conditions, down from more than 90% in the early days of the pandemic.

## How does B117 Spread?

> I don't think anyone is sure right now. What we know for sure is that it's more contagious based on the fact that it spreads quicker according to contact tracing in the UK. 
> 
> It's probably some combination of 3 things: lower infectious dose, higher viral load, and longer shedding. That means, fewer particles are needed to infect someone, the infected sheds more particles, and the infected sheds particles sooner and doesn't stop shedding until later. We don't know yet which characteristic is more responsible for the variant being more contagious overall.  It's also possible that all 3 are equally responsible in a triple whammy.
> 
> Scientists need to study it more to understand what makes it more contagious.
> 
> Masks should still work as far as reducing the amount of particles goes. Masks block aerosol and droplets, not individual virus. Microscopic changes to the protein spikes on the virus should have no effect on the physical properties of the aerosol and droplets. What is a problem, however, is the combination of lower infectious dose and higher viral load. Lesser masks like cotton masks and especially neck gaiters and bandanas may filter out enough to provide some protection with the OG coronavirus but they may filter too little to be protective now. It's not that the masks stopped working but that there are more particles of the new variant to filter out and that fewer particles of the new variant are needed to infect someone. This means medical masks are preferred over non-medical masks.
