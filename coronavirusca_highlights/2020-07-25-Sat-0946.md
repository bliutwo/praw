## In Cell Studies, Seaweed Extract Outperforms Remdesivir in Blocking COVID-19 Virus

Summary of [original article](https://news.rpi.edu/content/2020/07/23/cell-studies-seaweed-extract-outperforms-remdesivir-blocking-covid-19-virus):

> Published online today in Cell Discovery, the research is the latest example of a decoy strategy researchers from the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute are developing against viruses like the novel coronavirus that spawned the current global health crisis. "Sulfated polysaccharides effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro" was published in Cell Discovery with the support of the National Research Foundation of Korea. At Rensselaer, Dordick and Linhardt were joined in the research by Paul S. Kwon, Seok-Joon Kwon, Weihua Jin, Fuming Zhang, and Keith Fraser, and by researchers at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology in Cheongju, Republic of Korea, and Zhejiang University of Technology in Hangzhou, China.

> Kind of disappointed to see a .edu with clickbait like this. It's not some random "seaweed extract", it's heparin which is made from seaweed and has long been in medical use. Just say heparin outperforms remdesivir in studies.

## Coronavirus: California sets daily death record for second consecutive day

Summary of [original article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/07/24/coronavirus-california-sets-daily-death-record-for-second-consecutive-day/amp):

> For a second consecutive day Thursday, California recorded more deaths from COVID-19 than any previous day of the pandemic, pushing its average daily death toll from the virus to its highest level yet. Four counties in Southern California each reported at least 20 deaths, while the entire Bay Area recorded seven. Los Angeles, with about 10 million residents vs. the Bay's 8 million, has reported about 40 deaths per day over the past week; it's been 30 per day in surrounding Southern California counties, population 11.3 million; in a swath of Central California, almost twice as many people are dying each day from the virus, despite a population 2 million smaller than the Bay Area.
