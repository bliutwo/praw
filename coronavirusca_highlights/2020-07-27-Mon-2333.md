Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hywv1f/la_health_department_finally_shut_down_my_moms/):

> I don't know if this is the correct place to post this or if LA County has a specific page but my mom works for a food processing plant lets just say they provide food for the Golden Arches the most recognized fast food chain in the world. The day my mother called out July 13, 47 other employees called out sick for the first time due to covid. Well they make all the food for this fast food chain in this state and most of Western U.S. so if they can't produce food for them they might have to close locations depending how long this shut down last.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hz1gi4/covid_update_july_27_2020_a_new_cognitive_test/):

> The scary thing is that case doubling days have dropped from 28 days to just 8 days. OC, for example, went up by 178%, and SD increased by 123%. Case doubling days didn't go down, whereas in OC they dropped by 4 days to 24 days, and in SD, they went from 38 days to 27 days. Decrease in case doubling days from 38 days to 27 days.

> I respect all the research you’ve done and it’s very impressive, but I feel like the people who are criticizing BLM protests are just using covid as an excuse. You can give them any kind of statistics you want, they just want an easy not blatantly racist reason to criticize the protestors. It’s like a racist dog whistle.

## No COVID-19 cash for rural cities questioning Newsom's rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2020-07-27/gavin-newsom-covid-19-cash-blocked-rural-cities-newsletter-essential-politics):

> On Friday, city leaders in Atwater and Coalinga - communities about 100 miles apart and together smaller than 150 other cities in California - were told federal coronavirus relief funds were being withheld due to local actions the Newsom administration says are in violation of state public health rules. Because California's largest communities received money directly from the feds - a total of $5.8 billion to counties and cities with populations over 500,000 - the state budget provides help for less-populous locations. "The state remains optimistic that these cities will do what is right to protect public health and safety in their communities and will move expeditiously to rescind their resolutions," said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the state emergency services agency.

> I think this is how it ought to be.  Covid bailout money is for people and places that must stay closed.  If you stay open, no money!  Should be this way everywhere.
