> Sure they will. Yes, they’ll get moved to a more restrictive tier.  But, the half-assing of following the health orders, and minimal enforcement will not change. I’m jaded, in LA County, though where we probably won’t move to a lower tier until spring.

## Coronavirus is again stalking California, but there is still time to prevent a 'third wave'

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-08/is-california-headed-to-a-third-coronavirus-wave):

> Although California has started to see a rise in coronavirus cases, the pace of increase is slower than that seen in the rest of the United States, and experts said there is still time to prevent a third wave. The number of weekly coronavirus cases California has recorded recently is far below its peak. Texas on Halloween surpassed California as the state with the most coronavirus cases.

> I am a teacher as well. I think technically they can. One thing you may be able to do, though (it IS a short term fix, but could get you through to January), is use the FFCRA COVID time. It's 10 days and one of the reasons for taking the time is with a doctor's note. I have my district's form that I filled out for a different reason, but it has district logos all over it so I really don't want to be posting it all over the internet. One of the reasons you can use the 10 days is if a doctor tells you that you should self quarantine. I'm not sure if that includes pre-existing conditions, though. After that, there's sick time.  After that, it's the extended leave of absence at 2/3 pay.

> I live in the Central Valley. Since last Friday, we have had 8 students from 7th grade (185 kids) sent to quarantine. We aren't told if they're positive or if it's close contact. We have no clue. I heard a rumor that several of these cases stem from some birthday party and people in the town are going into quarantine in mass numbers (It's a small town). I've been home the last 5 days because I live in a different city and my own kids haven't gone back in person. My husband is deployed so I'm home with them.  Anyway, 8 kids over the course of 2 school days is not good and I'm wondering how many kids are still coming to school despite some sort of exposure. The city I work in has a lot of COVID deniers.

> Meanwhile, tons of people on my social media feeds posting pictures out at dinner or large family/friend gatherings.  I saw someone recently who has a baby younger than mine.  I assumed they'd been being as careful as me.  "Oh, Covid?  That's over with, hahahaha."  Ya hahahaha F U.
