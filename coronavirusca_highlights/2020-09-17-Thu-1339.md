## Trump called 'demented' after blaming 'blue states' for coronavirus death toll

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-called-demented-blaming-blue-states-coronavirus-death/story?id=73073793):

> "And that's despite the fact that the blue states had had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the states, they were blue states and blue state-managed." These five states also have the largest populations in the country and were the first to tackle major outbreaks of the virus, suggesting that there is no scientific correlation between political party of state leaders and the spread of the virus. "COVID isn't a red state or blue state issue. 9 of the 10 states with the most infections per capita have Republican governors. This virus has impacted all Americans."

> Great way of thinking about. The world population would be smaller, if we just took our China.

## CDC: If all Americans wore masks, the virus would be controlled in 6 to 12 weeks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007344183/redfield-cdc-masks.html):

> Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators that if all Americans wore masks, the coronavirus could be controlled in six to 12 weeks. Today, and even after we have a vaccine, C.D.C. encourages all Americans to embrace the powerful tools that we have right now - to wear a mask, particularly when they're in public, maintain social distancing, routine vigilant handwashing. Face mask - these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have.

## USC and UCLA can play football, but kids can't go to school...

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iulp7f/usc_and_ucla_can_play_football_but_kids_cant_go/):

> "I want to make this crystal clear," Newsom said. Kindergarteners have to learn over ZOOM, but students playing full contact college football and all of the close physical interaction that comes with that sport between the hundreds of players/coaches/staff/media during games, practices, team meetings/meals, etc is fine. To be fair, I was very much on his side and how he handled things early on regarding the virus, but now it just feels like we're getting played.... EDIT: For the record, I'm a UCLA alumni and HUGE college football fan, but I'm also a parent and this just feels like another slap in the face.

> Playing football is a bad idea. That doesn't mean that in-person learning isn't also a bad idea. These things aren't really related at all.

## Developed this simple tool yesterday. Aimed to help you decide which events to go to, from a covid angle. Hoping to help people make educated decisions.

> Seems good, but the "?"s are currently unclickable (i.e. require highlight, which won't work for mobile users). Not sure of easiest way to fix that (is z-index still a thing?).

## Positive Covid tests in no-lockdown Sweden hit lowest rate since pandemic began

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-strategy/positive-covid-tests-in-no-lockdown-sweden-hit-lowest-rate-since-pandemic-began-idUSKBN25Z2TM):

> STOCKHOLM - Sweden carried out a record number of new coronavirus tests last week with only 1.2% coming back positive, the health agency said on Tuesday, the lowest rate since the pandemic began at a time when countries across Europe are seeing surges in infections. Sweden carried out over 120,000 tests last week with just over 1,300 coming back positive, far below the 19% positive tests hit during some weeks in the spring, and now has the lowest rate of spread in Scandinavia. "Our strategy has been consistent and sustainable. We probably have a lower risk of spread here compared to other countries," said Jonas Ludvigsson, professor of epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet, adding that Sweden likely had a higher level of immunity in the population than most countries.

> They also only have 2.1 million people and the population doesn’t have problem wearing masks.   
> 
> They also have neighbors that took it seriously and reduced their rates too
