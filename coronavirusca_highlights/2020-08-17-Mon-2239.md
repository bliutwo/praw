> Insane. You’d think that someone not wearing a mask wouldn’t want to confirm their self-centered, thoughtless nature. :/

> I got a test today.  6-10 business days isn't good enough.

## Children are very contagious, should wear masks to school to prevent COVID spread: Swedish researchers

Summary of [original article](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2020/aug/16/children-are-very-contagious-should-wear-masks-to-school-to-prevent-covid-spread-13899.html):

> A group of 26 Swedish researchers suggested that children should wear face masks in schools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it was reported. According to the researchers, there is now data from South Korea, the US and Israel that proves that the children are contagious - and data from Sweden that proves that the children can become seriously ill. On its website, the Swedish Public Health Agency, which offers national guidance for the pandemic, writes that the current state of knowledge shows that few children and young people are infected with Covid-19 - and that school activities have not been shown to be a driving force in the spread of infection.

> This group of people is very contagious. Therefore they should gather for 6 hours in small rooms for 5 days a week.

## Political battles, confusion reign in Kern County, one of worst U.S. coronavirus hot spots

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-17/kern-county-pained-by-confusing-covid-19-guidance):

> Kern County has become one of the worst coronavirus hot spots in the nation, with infections spreading rapidly through food processing plants, agricultural communities and other places in Bakersfield and small rural towns. On Sunday, Kern County had the second-highest per capita infection rate in California, behind Merced County, with 723 cases per 100,000 people over the last two weeks, according to The Times coronavirus tracker. Constantine received a separate email from the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services with contacts for multiple agencies as well as a "Centralized email address" for counties on the state's coronavirus watch list to request help dealing with specific sectors or businesses.

`/u/yggdrasil9652` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ibp2ng/political_battles_confusion_reign_in_kern_county/):

> It's completely mind boggling to see how not seriously people are taking this in my town which is just barely inside of Kern Co. And seeing what the sheriff said about not wanting to enforce wearing masks, etc, it now makes sense why none of the sheriffs in town are wearing masks and doing literally nothing to enforce guidelines.

## More California counties make state coronavirus watchlist as Santa Cruz is removed

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-17/california-coronavirus-case-backlog-watchlist-updated-calredie):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that four new counties would be required to close hair salons, gyms and other businesses, marking the first time the state has updated its list of areas experiencing high transmission of COVID-19 in more than two weeks since a massive data flub skewed the count of positive cases. Officials paused the list at 38 counties on July 31 as the state worked to correct problems with its electronic disease reporting and surveillance system, known as CalREDIE. The data issues caused a backlog of 295,000 coronavirus test results and preceded the sudden departure of the state's public health officer, Dr. Sonia Angell, who oversaw the reporting system. Officials in San Diego County, which is expected to be removed from the watchlist Tuesday, noted that California Health and Humans Services Director Dr. Mark Ghaly said Monday that the state is still updating its guidance and planned to release further information to the counties this week.
