## California Capitol Reinstates Mask Mandate, Even For The Fully Vaccinated, Amid Outbreak

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/california-capitol-mask-mandate-covid-19_n_60e6221fe4b0f79e8fe71df4):

> California has reinstated a mask mandate for all lawmakers and staff at the state Capitol in Sacramento  regardless of their vaccination status  following a recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases among legislative staffers. "As we know from the most recent cases, even fully vaccinated individuals can be infected with COVID-19," Contreras said in the memo. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that fully vaccinated people can "Resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws."
