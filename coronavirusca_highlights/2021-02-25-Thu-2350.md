> 
> Largest population state has largest deaths per states...who would've thought. But by population, CA has done better than average.

> "Yesterday, we updated our COVID-19 vaccine web page to include an inquiry portal for childcare centers and K-12 education workers. We will join LA County in adding this group as eligible for vaccine beginning next week." Counties don't know how much vaccine they'll be getting from one week to the next. A. Much like flu vaccines are tweaked each year to address different strains, coronavirus vaccines can be re-engineered to battle new variants, experts said.

`/u/Float-Your-Goat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lrwqry/concierge_care_provider_one_medical_gave_covid19/):

> From the article it sounds like they're being accused of not verifying that people who sign up are actually eligible. It says they've been requiring people to check the box that confirms they're eligible since Jan 14, which seems like about as much verification as anyone else is doing.
> 
> I got it through a community health center. I had to check a box when I signed up that I was eligible under the current guidelines, but even though I brought documentation with me to my appointment no one asked to see it. Same story for others I know who got it through PAMF.

Summary of [original article](https://laist.com/latest/post/20210224/hundreds-of-covid-19-deaths-went-unreported-during-LAs-winter-surge):

> While L.A. County health officials say we're now on "The other side" of the deadly winter coronavirus surge, they've confirmed hundreds more deaths from the virus during that time that until now, went unrecorded. Most of the 806 deaths happened between December 3rd and the beginning of February. The Department of Public Health will update its data and trend lines for that period to account for the deaths that weren't recorded at the time.

> I'm cautiously optimistic that California will be looking significantly recovered by May and by summer things will be relatively normal. I can't wait to go to the movies and theme parks again. Also museums too, I feel like I never fully appreciated the wide variety of museums CA had until they were closed.
