> Like others across Riverside County, the restaurant will be shifting to outdoor seating after the county fell back to the purple tier of the state's coronavirus reopening system. Rising coronavirus rates will force Riverside County back into the most restrictive tier of the state's coronavirus reopening framework, the county's public health officer said Tuesday morning, Oct. 20. Dr. Cameron Kaiser made the announcement that the county was moving from the red to purple tier at the Riverside County Board of Supervisors meeting.

> Not surprised at all.  I live in Riverside and so many businesses are not enforcing masks at all.  They'll either put a sign out that says masks required, but then staff don't wear them and they don't enforce customers wearing them, or the sign will frame wearing masks as an optional suggestion and not a requirement.  See people out walking, biking, walking dogs, etc, no masks in sight every day.

> I'm about at the point where I'm ready to buy a megaphone just so I can shame anti-mask people as I drive past them.

## Disneyland, Universal Studios Receive Stringent California State Guidelines to Reopen

Summary of [original article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneyland-universal-studios-receive-stringent-california-state-guidelines-to-reopen):

> The industry has been locked in a bitter battle with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, which came to a boiling point weeks ago when The Walt Disney Co. demanded the state allow its theme park to reopen, pointing to its counterpart in Florida, which began its successful phased reopening over the summer. "We have proven that we can responsibly reopen, with science-based health and safety protocols strictly enforced at our theme park properties around the world. Nevertheless, the State of California continues to ignore this fact, instead mandating arbitrary guidelines that it knows are unworkable and that hold us to a standard vastly different from other reopened businesses and state-operated facilities," Potrock said in a statement. After being blasted shortly thereafter by Disney and the California Attractions & Parks Association for being "Unreasonable," Newsom said he would send a team to visit Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood, as well as Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando, to see firsthand - and report back - how the parks operate with the new health and safety measures in place.

> Yeah. I'm gonna have to get a new job. I'm honestly surprised my park hasn't officially let me go, I've been furloughed for 7 months. Unemployment money has been okay, but it's not sustainable.
> 
> I'm not happy, but I understand why Newsom is doing this. Look at all the other states pushing their hospitals to the limit once again right now. It doesn't help that 40% of the country believes masks are bad thanks to the President.

Summary of [original article](https://www.kcra.com/article/californias-feared-surge-of-virus-cases-hasnt-happened/34419757):

> California's feared surge of virus cases hasn't happened. Near the end of September, with coronavirus cases falling and more schools and businesses reopening, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration urged restraint, citing a statistical model that predicted a startling 89% increase in virus hospitalizations in the next month. Monday, Newsom said he was not considering similar rules for travelers to California.
