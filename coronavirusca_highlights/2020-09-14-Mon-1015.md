## LA mayor Garcetti: I would have acted sooner if Trump hadn't downplayed virus

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/516202-garcetti-no-question-i-would-have-acted-sooner-if-trump-hadnt-downplayed):

> Garcetti said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he would have taken action earlier, and saved lives in the process, if Trump had publicly shared what he said privately to journalist Bob Woodward. Asked after the Woodward recordings were released if he misled the public or downplayed the coronavirus, Trump told reporters, "If you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that's so." Navarro said Trump "Was straightforward," but he did not fully address Tapper's questions in the heated interview regarding Trump's conflicting statements in February between the Woodward interview and a press conference Trump held just days later.

> I like Mayor Garcetti a lot, but come on.  Garcetti isn't listening to Trump.  Never was.  He's just throwing some well earned shade.

## COVID cases spur bill requiring employers disclose workplace outbreaks

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2020/09/12/investigation-bill-spur-california-employers-disclose-outbreaks/3462052001/):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom could arm California's vast agricultural workforce and local public health officers with more information about workplace coronavirus outbreaks under a bill that's on his desk. A monthlong investigation by CalMatters and The Salinas Californian uncovered reports of six outbreaks at seven companies that employ guest workers in four counties, sickening more than 350 workers. As the bill was heard in committee, Assembleymember Lorena Gonzalez, a San Diego Democrat who chairs the California Latino Legislative Caucus, said much of the state's nearly 14,000 deaths have fallen on Latino workers.

## With schools now reopening everywhere amid the pandemic, we could see a spike in Covid-19 cases. The UFT threatened to walk. Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi reopened last month, and cases jumped 90% within days among students. Why not mandate having all classes online until a vaccine?

## Why hasn't California opted into Apple and Google's Covid Notification technology?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/irpwg2/why_hasnt_california_opted_into_apple_and_googles/):

> The new iOS update had features meant to use bluetooth technology to opt into covid notifications if a person close contact reported a positive test. The technology is not available in California yet. Our state hasn't met our contact tracer hiring target either.

`/u/realEYEZwhoUr` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/irpwg2/why_hasnt_california_opted_into_apple_and_googles/):

> If I remember correctly, there was a concern regarding the privacy and data collection of California citizens. Instead of using Apple's and Google's Covid tracker tech, California instead opted to hire around 20,000 people to preform contact tracing.
