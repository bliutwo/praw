## California experiencing a ‘mass fatality event’ as the state buckles under Covid. A surge of cases following Halloween and Thanksgiving means now the most seriously ill of those patients are dying in unprecedented numbers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-covid-mass-fatality-b1784952.html):

> Dr Vohra said: "This is a mass casualty, a mass fatality event that our county is experiencing. And we've had to expand the storage areas for the dead bodies here in Fresno County beyond what's normal." LA County's Methodist Hospital of Southern California has convened an in-house triage team that makes daily evaluations "About the severity of critically ill patients that allows us to distribute resources to those who need it the most," said chief strategy officer Cliff Daniels. State officials should thus override decisions by many county health officers that prevent recovering coronavirus patients from being released to skilled nursing facilities, despite fears that they could spread the virus, Coyle said.

> A mass fatality event. Is that what we're calling it now? Yikes. Hoping that the Bay Area doesn't have to deal with what's going on in SoCal right now. That's scary.

On Saturday, L.A. County reached new milestones in the pandemic: more than 12,000 dead from COVID-19 and more than 900,000 cases of the coronavirus. On Monday, six men and women from the California National Guard arrived to assist county workers in the loading of bodies from hospital morgues into one of 12 refrigerated storage units at the L.A. County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner, said Sarah Ardalani, a spokeswoman with the coroner's office.

> Mom's an ICU nurse. Usual load is 2 patients, but nowadays she's running around handling 4. To somewhat address the understaffing, they partnered my mom with another nurse that's been out of practice for 30 years. Didn't know how to use some equipment, but was left with tasks a monkey can do. I'll give you one guess who is getting paid more.
> 
> Management "politely" asks my mom if she wants work on her day off. Mom already works enough up to her tax bracket, so anymore would just be more taxes. Mom "politely" declines.
> 
> Appreciate your nurses yo!
