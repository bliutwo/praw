## This county knew coronavirus could ravage its farmworkers. Why didn't officials stop it? — Weeks later, San Joaquin County is so overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases that military medical teams have been sent to two local hospitals. ICU beds are scarce, and the surge has hit farm workers especially hard.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-25/coronavirus-covid-19-farm-workers-san-joaquin-valley):

> Siblings Carla, Samuel and Citlati Mendoza and their niece, Mila Gros, hang out at their home in a migrant housing center in French Camp, Calif. Citlali Mendoza, 18, currently lives with her farmworker parents in a low-slung complex of cramped apartments near the county jail. Though a state program to move some vulnerable unsheltered people into hotels helped, providing 76 rooms for those at risk of contracting the virus, 71 homeless people have caught it, according to official county figures, sending them to local hospitals in some cases. Park said the county is now working to secure hotel rooms for homeless people waiting for test results.

> Because most farm workers are latino immigrants that are being abused by state loopholes that are difficult to close.
> 
> Im hoping that this will be the spark that forces Newsom to push for laws that protect farm workers. Even those without papers.
>

> But according to advocates for agricultural employees, the coronavirus is also ravaging Latino farmworkers because they have long been treated as disposable labor in California, risking their lives in heat waves and pesticide-laden fields to help put food on people’s tables. The pandemic has only amplified the brew of conservative politics, economic pressures and historic disparities that run through the farmlands of California’s inland counties, they say, resulting in government aid that seems too little, too late.
