## Is anyone else noticing inconsistencies between state and county data?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/invcm9/is_anyone_else_noticing_inconsistencies_between/):

> Gov, Marin County's cases per 100,000 per day is 5.9. Marin's public health officer has said multiple times that Marin needs 19 of less cases per day, but that has only happened maybe a 3rd of the days over the last few weeks - usually on weekends. So why is Marin getting to drop down into the red on Tuesday when the data the county publicly publishes says they shouldn't be able to?

> Yes, multiple counties public data does not match the case rate reported by the State. 
> 
> Orange County has this problem as well and there has been major contention in the comments of the health department's Facebook posts about it.
> 
> A few things that can lead to this issue...
> 
> 1. You mention that you are using the number of positive cases reported each day, but the state is using "episode dates" to determine the case rate. This means that each positive test is assigned back to the earliest known date of infection. The positive tests reported today might actually be distributed over the past 2+ weeks depending on testing delays and when each person decided to go get tested.
> 
> 2. The State is removing prison cases from the case rate calculation.

## ‘This Has Been a Lot': Teen Struggles With Severe Inflammatory Syndrome After COVID-19 Battle

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/coronavirus/covid-19-mis-c-inflammatory-syndrome-health-complications-coronavirus-lakewood-los-angeles-county-health/2422283/):

> Los Angeles County health officials are monitoring the case in Lakewood and about two dozen other MIS-C - multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome- cases in the county. The severe inflammatory syndrome can affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes and gastrointestinal organs, potentially having life-long health impacts. "While most children are only minimally sickened by COVID-19, they can get it just as easily as adults, and an unlucky few will have serious complications,'' Riverside County Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said. ``While this case is not known to be linked to any school, it's a reminder we need to pay attention to COVID-19 in kids and its potential long- and short-term effects.''".
