## President elect Joe Biden announcing COVID task force on Monday

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/biden-to-announce-covid-19-task-force-monday-23b353bd-863b-4e0f-bb64-c6da4a5758b2.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=1100):

> Joe Biden plans Monday to name a 12-member task force to combat and contain the spread of the coronavirus, sources tell Axios. Why it matters: By announcing a COVID task force even before unveiling his senior White House staff or a single cabinet appointment, Biden is signaling that addressing the coronavirus will be the immediate priority for his transition, and then his potential administration. Some members of the group have been advising Biden throughout the campaign, both the public policy challenges, as well as adopting health protocols for the campaign itself to prevent the spread of the virus in Biden's inner circle.

## Case Rate Alternative Presentation

`/u/EightyCL` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jqoj0t/case_rate_alternative_presentation/):

> I  think the standard way that the Blueprint for a Safer Economy tiers   are presented is confusing, to me and others.  In particular, I think   normalizing the case rate by population and adjusting it with a factor   based on testing makes it harder to understand what's happening.
> 
> I've  made a plot for San Diego that shows the case rate as an average  of  the daily cases (not per capita), and instead of applying the   adjustment to the case rate, I apply it to the threshold.  This, I   think, is a lot clearer.
> 
> This is  all just rearranging the existing test the state is using, so  it's  equivalent.  It's just a better way of presenting the results.
> 
> I'd love to get feedback or questions.

## Preparing for a winter with the coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/preparing-winter-coronavirus):

> To understand how the novel coronavirus manages to persist in circumstances in which the flu virus fails, Zhu, Zhao and colleagues modeled different temperatures and relative humidities along a continuum from hot and dry to cold and humid in typical indoor spaces, where the virus is distributed by normal speech and breathing - and, according to the paper, where people "Only sneeze or cough into a tissue or their elbows." To these scenarios they added emerging knowledge about the highly contagious microbe; in particular, how long it remains infectious outside a host. In addition to its ability to travel farther, the virus is particularly persistent in cooler temperatures, remaining "Infectious from several minutes to longer than a day in various environments," according to several published studies. "Combined with our study, we think we can maybe provide design guidelines for the optimal filtering for facial masks," said Zhao, adding that the research could be used to quantify real exposure to the virus - how much virus could land on one's body over a certain period of exposure.

## Have you noticed more people going maskless inside after the election results?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jq45q1/have_you_noticed_more_people_going_maskless/):

> Not the majority but noticeable with their pickup trucks, flags, and shouting especially the 2 days before the election. When it became obvious Biden was going to win things quieted down, they're not shamelessly on the streets anymore. Before the recent events, I'd say 95% of the people here would wear masks indoors, but when I went shopping today there were LOTS of people unmasked.

`/u/zardoz88_moot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jq45q1/have_you_noticed_more_people_going_maskless/):

> Trumpers are feral animals and should be treated as such. Sorry i can't "come together and heal" with people trying to kill my family.  We are not "one America". 50% of the country are racist, sexist assholes who dont care who they kill with COVID19. I will not forget, and neither should you.
