## Bay Area parents with unvaccinated children unsure how to navigate reopened California

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Bay-Area-parents-with-unvaccinated-children-16260894.php):

> Parents of young children say they're feeling left behind, and even finding themselves trapped in a new conundrum: How do they keep kids too young to be vaccinated safe as the world around them reopens? The reopening of schools is its own fraught issue in many California communities, as districts contemplate how to bring children back full time and reassure parents and teachers that it's safe. Some parents say the state's reopening puts their children at greater risk because restrictions like masking and social distancing have largely gone away.
