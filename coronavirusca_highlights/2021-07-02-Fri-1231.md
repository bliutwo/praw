## Delta variant is spreading in California as COVID-19 battle enters an uncertain phase — “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-24/covid-19-delta-variant-spread-california-how-bad-is-it):

> The Delta variant of the coronavirus is beginning to spread in California, offering a preview of how the battle of the pandemic is going to change as officials move to protect a shrinking minority who remain at risk because they have not been vaccinated. There were only a tiny handful of cases of the Delta variant in the U.K. in late March, but that grew to about 25% of cases by early May. By mid-June, 95% of cases were tied to the Delta variant. The Delta variant is now the fourth most-often identified variant in California.

> Excerpt: 
> 
> > The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U.S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world.
> 
> > And vaccines available in the U.S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.
> 
> > “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”
> 
> > Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that walloped the nation three times in the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t been previously been infected with the coronavirus.
> 
> > This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated.
> 
> > Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”

## California Reopens: Cases Rising As Delta Variant Spreads Among Unvaccinated – CBS San Francisco

Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/07/01/california-reopens-cases-rising-delta-variant-spreads-among-unvaccinated):

> SAN FRANCISCO - California broadly reopened its economy barely two weeks ago and since then an especially contagious coronavirus variant has spread among the unvaccinated, a development that has health officials on edge and already has prompted Los Angeles County to strongly recommend everyone resume wearing masks inside. LA County, where a quarter of the state's nearly 40 million people live, recommended Monday that vaccinated residents resume wearing face coverings indoors after detecting that about half of all cases were the delta variant. The variant - which accounts for a fifth of new U.S. infections - was found in 15% of specimens sequenced in California in June, up from 5% in May. In Orange County, the variant accounts for 45% of sequenced cases in the most recent week, said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county's deputy health officer.

> Tough shit. Get vaccinated if you don’t want to get sick, or wear a mask.

## Breakthrough COVID is rare in California – Most of the 7,553 infections were minor, although 62 people have died. The rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths among unvaccinated people is far higher.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/breakthrough-covid-california/):

> The breakthrough infections through June 23 amount to 0.039% of vaccinated Californians - or one case out of every 2,583 vaccinated people. Most of the infections were minor, but 62 vaccinated Californians died from COVID-19, according to California Department of Public Health data. The risks of the disease far outweigh the chance of a breakthrough case: More COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the past four days than the total number of vaccinated people who died from it over the past six months.

> 
> No but really this is fantastic news. It feels like we’re almost out of this hell.

> And “increase of a percentage” is an easily manipulated headline.  It is a 17% increase of a low number, and it’s among unvaccinated people.  No need to freak out.

> 
> Zero sympathy to the dummies who didn’t get vaxxed.  May you see why you should believe in science and those who are smarter then you.
> 
> For the 12 and under crowd, may your parents be smart and make you mask up until your turn for the vaccine.
> 
> To the unvaccinated due to health reasons, double mask and keep your self safe.  I’m sorry your life can’t return to normal.
> 
> As for me. I’m vaccinated and trust the science.  Looks like there is a small risk of infection but everything in life comes with some risk and im comfortable with my chances.
> 
> If I am requested to mask again, I’ll do it because im not an asshole.

> >The building was recently sold, and the cafe's lease with the new owners — a couple from Marin — was canceled in June just days after the cafe made national headlines in late May for adding a $5 fee for those who ordered food from his cafe with masks on.
> 
> ...
> 
> >"We respect and are accepting of all our Tenants' political and personal beliefs. However, if a Tenant's behavior impacts the business of other Tenants (driving away customers to the building) or creates a potential liability (e.g. large fines the building owner is ultimately responsible for or conflict in the community that could translate into physical altercations), then it becomes a business decision as to whether or not to continue the Tenancy. ... Hours were spent discussing Chris Castleman with members of the Mendocino community and it became clear from the feedback that it was in our best interest for him to leave. Out of respect for Chris, we will not repeat the intense negative feedback we have heard from the community and strong advice that he needed to leave ASAP. 
> 
> >"During our evaluation, Chris Castleman created a false narrative that we ended his month-to-month lease due to a disagreement with his ideology. We received multiple messages — many threatening — from his supporters that expressed dismay we would not renew his lease based on a difference in ideology. This narrative is patently false. This is a business and since we will be losing money with the decision to end his lease, its just indicative of the magnitude to which Mr. Castleman's beliefs have interfered and added risk to the overall business. We have heard from people in the community that continue to steer clear of the building as a result of Mr Castleman, and some have expressed fear."

## Delta COVID Variant Triples in California - The Santa Barbara Independent

> So the percentage of delta amongst the infected tripled from 4.7% to 14.5%. That doesn't mean anything if the amount of actual cases stay constant. I'm assuming they left out the actual case count comparison in their article because it doesn't match their alarmist clickbait headline.
> 
> EDIT: 193 7 day rolling average on 06/29 vs 157 7 day rolling average on 05/29 in LA County. That's a 23% increase, not a tripling.
