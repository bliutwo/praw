## LA County sees surge in virus cases, urges vaccinations

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/LA-County-sees-surge-in-virus-cases-urges-16291079.php):

> The county averaged nearly 300 new cases a day over a seven-day period that ended Wednesday, representing an increase of 85% from the seven-day period that ended June 24. Santa Clara County dropped its death toll by nearly 23%. The county had been including in its COVID-19 death toll anyone who tested positive for the virus before or after they died, regardless of the listed cause of death. The change, which follows a similar move in Alameda County in early June, drops the overall number of COVID-19 fatalities in Santa Clara County to 1,698 people.

## Unvaccinated people face growing danger as Delta variant stalls herd immunity

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-12/options-as-contagious-delta-variant-stalls-herd-immunity):

> Recent spikes in coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County and elsewhere in California underscore a pandemic divergence, in which the unvaccinated face growing danger, while the vaccinated are able to move back to regular activities without fear of getting sick. The coronavirus case rate for California's unvaccinated residents is eight times higher than it is for vaccinated residents: For every 100,000 unvaccinated residents, 4.9 per day become infected, while for every 100,000 vaccinated residents, 0.6 are infected. In Los Angeles County, the Delta variant has spread mainly among unvaccinated people.

But with the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, infections are again on the rise — and communities with low vaccination rates are in the crosshairs.

## Is this legit? Have other people got this text? I’ve been getting scam-texts since about 4-5 months ago and am wary about clicking anything.

> Yes, it's legitimate. But always a good thing to be wary of these types of things, and do your research first.  Here's the LA county page that mentions them working with Healthvana for vaccine records:

## Vaccination percentages by county? I am looking for a map that shows vaccination percentages by county (not zip code.) Leaving on a trip very soon and want a visual of how careful to be at various stops. The state one I found only had total doses, not percentages. Thanks!

The state one I found only had total doses, not percentages. Across California, the rate of COVID-19 tests that are positive has tripled since the state fully reopened last month.

> This isn't exactly what you asked for, but the CDC has a COVID Data Tracker map that makes it very easy to see how prevalent COVID is in the county you're traveling to. I used it on a recent road trip around the state.

## California to require masks at school, a cautious decision that treats all students the same

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/california-to-require-masks-in-schools-despite-cdc-guidelines-theyre-not-needed-if-vaccinated):

> The new school year in California will start with students and teachers wearing masks, state officials announced Friday, staking out a cautious position on a day when new federal guidelines stressed the importance of fully reopening schools and recommended masks only for those who are not vaccinated. As part of a multilayered approach to limit the spread of COVID-19, those who are not vaccinated should wear masks indoors - and schools, health departments or states may continue to require masks on campus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In May, the CDC said that Americans in general don't have to be as cautious about masks and distancing outdoors and that fully vaccinated people don't need masks in most situations.

`/u/MachineGunTeacher` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ohx49m/california_to_require_masks_at_school_a_cautious/):

> I’m curious about when we won’t have to wear masks. I can tell you that teaching with a mask on makes it so much more difficult for language learners and those who struggle with hearing (which is a lot more than you’d think because of ear buds causing damage).
