## Orange County bans health officials from supervisor's COVID-19 press briefings

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-03/orange-county-covid-19-press-conferences):

> Orange County has barred county health officials from providing COVID-19 updates at a county supervisor's news conferences. The briefings held by Supervisor Katrina Foley had become one of the few sources of regular COVID-19 information in California's third-most populous county after the Board of Supervisors stopped providing updates by its top health official at its meetings and suspended press briefings by health officials for several months. "We have updated numbers on COVID-19 posted daily, followed by weekly press releases and press calls by the county's CEO team and our county health officer," Do said.
