## Trump called 'demented' after blaming 'blue states' for coronavirus death toll

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-called-demented-blaming-blue-states-coronavirus-death/story?id=73073793):

> "And that's despite the fact that the blue states had had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the states, they were blue states and blue state-managed." These five states also have the largest populations in the country and were the first to tackle major outbreaks of the virus, suggesting that there is no scientific correlation between political party of state leaders and the spread of the virus. "COVID isn't a red state or blue state issue. 9 of the 10 states with the most infections per capita have Republican governors. This virus has impacted all Americans."

## CDC: If all Americans wore masks, the virus would be controlled in 6 to 12 weeks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007344183/redfield-cdc-masks.html):

> Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators that if all Americans wore masks, the coronavirus could be controlled in six to 12 weeks. Today, and even after we have a vaccine, C.D.C. encourages all Americans to embrace the powerful tools that we have right now - to wear a mask, particularly when they're in public, maintain social distancing, routine vigilant handwashing. Face mask - these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have.

> Playing football is a bad idea. That doesn't mean that in-person learning isn't also a bad idea. These things aren't really related at all.

> Seems good, but the "?"s are currently unclickable (i.e. require highlight, which won't work for mobile users). Not sure of easiest way to fix that (is z-index still a thing?).
