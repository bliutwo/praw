> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

## California's positivity rate drops sharply, a promising indicator for reopening

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-s-coronavirus-positivity-rate-has-15957740.php):

> The percentage of coronavirus tests that came back positive over the past seven days - a closely watched indicator for reopening the economy - has dropped to 3.5%. That's down from over 11% a month ago. "That's the lowest I've seen it," California Department of Public Health Director Dr. Tomás Aragón said at a meeting of a state vaccine advisory committee on Wednesday. The falling transmission could help more counties move from California's purple - or most-restrictive - reopening tier to the slightly-less-restrictive red tier, in which indoor dining at 25% capacity and some additional activities are allowed.

> Sheer, utter arrogance (and money?)!
> 
> Excerpts: 
> 
> > Peter Diamandis, who is also an engineer, executive and scientist, believed he could create an “immunity bubble” and safely host a scaled-down version of his pricey annual tech conference.
> 
> > Instead, the conference became a superspreader event that infected 24 people, including Diamandis, with the novel coronavirus.
> 
> > “I thought creating a COVID ‘immunity bubble’ for a small group in a TV studio setting was possible,” Diamandis, 59, wrote in a blog post last week. “I was wrong.”
> 
> > . 
> 
> > Months earlier, A360’s parent company, Singularity University, canceled a large in-person gathering. But would-be attendees sick of living in isolation and willing to pay more than $30,000 inundated Diamandis and his team with requests.
> 
> > . 
> 
> > Diamandis believed he could create a COVID-free zone with polymerase chain reaction tests, considered by many to be the gold standard because they use genetic information to detect the virus.
> 
> > Everyone was required to take a PCR test 72 hours before the conference started on Jan. 23, then take another test when they arrived. A second swab was sent to a lab to confirm the results.
> 
> > . 
> 
> > About 25% of those in attendance tested positive. Only the audiovisual team, which was mostly isolated and always wore masks, was spared, Diamandis wrote.
> 
> > Masks were not mandatory for attendees during much of the conference.
> 
> > “I allowed myself a false (and dangerous) sense of security based on the belief that sequential PCR testing serves as a safety mechanism … which I can now tell you is a fallacy,” Diamandis wrote.
> 
> And how many other folks did that 25% go on to infect? There was that conference in Boston at the beginning of the pandemic that only had a few folks infected at the conference itself, but then snowballed into thousands of infected individuals.
