## As others chill, L.A. County sounds alarms over Delta variant, masks

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-03/as-others-chill-out-l-a-county-sounding-loud-alarms-over-delta-variant-mask-wearing):

> L.A. County public health officials are breaking with many other health departments, asking even inoculated residents to modify their behavior amid a concerning uptick in coronavirus transmission and the circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant. Officials attribute the increase of cases and hospitalizations in L.A. County in part to the Delta variant spreading among the region's unvaccinated population. L.A. County started seeing increases in the Delta variant in early April, and cases are rising.

## California Reopens: Cases Rising As Delta Variant Spreads Among Unvaccinated – CBS San Francisco

Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/07/01/california-reopens-cases-rising-delta-variant-spreads-among-unvaccinated):

> SAN FRANCISCO - California broadly reopened its economy barely two weeks ago and since then an especially contagious coronavirus variant has spread among the unvaccinated, a development that has health officials on edge and already has prompted Los Angeles County to strongly recommend everyone resume wearing masks inside. LA County, where a quarter of the state's nearly 40 million people live, recommended Monday that vaccinated residents resume wearing face coverings indoors after detecting that about half of all cases were the delta variant. The variant - which accounts for a fifth of new U.S. infections - was found in 15% of specimens sequenced in California in June, up from 5% in May. In Orange County, the variant accounts for 45% of sequenced cases in the most recent week, said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county's deputy health officer.
