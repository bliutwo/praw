## Orange County caterer has zero COVID precautions in pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/id1oe7/orange_county_caterer_has_zero_covid_precautions/):

> 24 Carrots Catering in Orange County are still putting on regular weddings, no social distancing, no masks, no guest count limits. People need to know how irresponsible this company is being in a pandemic. If the mayor of LA is willing to shut off power for parties, Orange County needs to do something similar to stop these parties from happening.

> I agree. One of the hotels in Laguna Beach ( located in OC) had a wedding of 60 guests. I'm suprised that this is actually happening in the middle of a global pandemic. This pandemic has bought out the stupidity out of people. 
> 
> I would report them to the heath department or shoot an email to the governor's office. 
> 
> There needs to be some serious fines and enforcement for companies that do this.
