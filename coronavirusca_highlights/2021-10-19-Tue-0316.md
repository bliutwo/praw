## NYT: F.D.A. to Allow ‘Mix and Match’ Approach for Covid Booster Shots

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/politics/fda-mix-and-match-boosters.html):

> Oct. 18, 2021.WASHINGTON - The Food and Drug Administration is planning to allow Americans to receive a different Covid-19 vaccine as a booster than the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators. Regulators are expected to follow the same approach they took with Pfizer's vaccine and authorize a booster of Moderna's vaccine about six months after the second shot. The C.D.C. says the Covid vaccine may be administered without regard to the timing of other vaccines, and many pharmacy sites are allowing people to schedule a flu shot at the same time as a booster dose.

> So does that mean if I had Pfizer I could get a Moderna shot and not have to worry about the effectiveness dropping off?  Or is the booster not the same strength as the full thing?

## School districts urge parents to keep kids in school amid Monday's vaccine mandate protest

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/school-districts-protest-vaccine-mandates/103-7538f507-8cdd-4e60-9e80-a82cb62dba9d):

> Thousands are expected to gather at the California State Capitol Oct. 18 at 10 a.m. SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Across the state, parents are planning to keep their kids home from school on Monday, Oct. 18 to protest California Gov. Gavin Newsom's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schoolchildren. Twin Rivers Unified School District Superintendent Steve Martinez asked parents to consider alternatives to keeping their children out of school. Other school districts and schools have also sent out letters to parents and families including Calaveras Unified School District, Summerville Union High School and others.

> I want to pipe in here.  I heard a lady at my school board in my left-wing town threaten to pull all the right-wing kids to protest vaccine mandates because the school loses money each day a kid is absent.
> 
> Here is the fatal flaw (pardon the pun). When one kid tests positive, they have to keep the close contacts home for a specific number of days and monitor EVERYONE. That costs money!
> 
> When a teacher gets Covid at school they have a workers compensation claim.  If a staff member dies from contracting Covid THAT is really expensive.
> 
> When antivax parents stop sending their kids to school all it does is saves a lot of time and money for all the compliant parents and staff.  There is no harm here.
> 
> In fact it would make the school board meetings much more productive.
> 
> In my school district, 92% of all the 12 and older kids are already voluntarily vaccinated. That 8% is only going to save Covid costs by keeping more kids enrolled full time and more staff will stay healthy.

## What sways homeless people to get COVID-19 shots? It could be other homeless people

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-18/los-angeles-homeless-people-peer-ambassadors-covid-vaccines):

> So in L.A. County, health officials are enlisting people living in tents, RVs and makeshift shelters to help get unhoused people vaccinated against COVID-19. The fledgling effort, which launched in August, is being funded as a study through the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. "A lot of people who are experiencing homelessness are not going to look at me or my healthcare colleagues as people who can speak to their experiences," said Chelsea L. Shover, a UCLA School of Medicine assistant professor and principal investigator for the study. "We've seen peers convince people who have told us no - repeatedly."

## How to get a Replacement Physical CDC Card?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qa7yk2/how_to_get_a_replacement_physical_cdc_card/):

> Hi! Does anyone know how to get a replaced physical CDC vaccination card? I got vaccinated months ago, and I lost my card. I tried contacting CDPH, and they just gave me the instructions for accessing my digital COVID19 vaccine card. I personally want a physical one since the digital one doesn't really look legit, in my opinion, and I don't want to unintentionally be accused of providing a fake vaccine card.

`/u/sfcnmone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qa7yk2/how_to_get_a_replacement_physical_cdc_card/):

> The CDPH digital card IS the legit document. I don't understand why you think an easily copied CDC card looks more legitimate. 
> 
> The problem is if you are traveling out of the US and they don't have means to access the digital card.

> Appears to be fixed now, which suggests that something broke over the weekend and they didn't have anyone on call to fix it during off hours.
