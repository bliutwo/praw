## L.A. will consider requiring vaccine proof at restaurants, gyms, indoor sporting events

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-04/l-a-will-consider-proposal-requiring-vaccinations-at-restaurants-gyms-sporting-events):

> Los Angeles will consider a proposal to require proof of COVID-19 inoculation as a condition of entry at a host of indoor public spaces in what, if passed, would be the widest-ranging vaccination-verification effort in the city yet. When asked about New York's decision, the California Department of Public Health responded: "California led the way by requiring vaccine verification of state and health care employees and continues to encourage local governments and business to follow suit. State guidelines allow community leaders to establish rules based on local conditions." L.A. County is also "Not requiring proof of vaccination for customers to enter specific businesses at this point in time," though public health officials added in a statement Tuesday that they "Applaud those businesses that are assessing risks to their employees and customers and adding additional layers of protection, including requiring proof of vaccination."

> Put up a sign saying “unvaccinated unwelcome” and you’ll have those people self boycott. Win/win.

`/u/ForeverCanBe1Second` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/oy9as6/tracking_coronavirus_hospitalizations_in/):

> This is so frustrating.  It is such an easy fix, yet the county I live in (Stanislaus) only has 35.7% of the population fully vaccinated.  It's not because the vaccines are not available.  I had to go to the hardware store today (item was not available on Amazon) and only about 10% of the customers were masked.  
> 
> I guess the upside is that our housing shortage will be solved.

## SF General Hospital to give supplemental mRNA vaccine to people who got J&J shot

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/10926455/?ex_cid=TA_KGO_FB&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A%20Trending%20Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR2wgSDXmkOJaOxxD5dCbXCwd8eEmGqQcheHcO3pE5hurfen8MJWQ8gz-Lo):

> SAN FRANCISCO - Even though the CDC is not recommending a booster shot at this time, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and San Francisco's Department of Public Health have decided to allow an extra coronavirus vaccine for people who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. "It's not a booster because it's not specific for some of the variants, which the booster ultimately will be," said Dr. Chris Colwell, chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General. San Francisco General is prioritizing City residents, but Dr. Winston says as long as their clinic has space and adequate vaccine supply, they will give the mRNA supplement to people from other counties.

`/u/km3r` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/oxe0li/sf_general_hospital_to_give_supplemental_mrna/):

> I got the J&J back in April and am debating this. The J&J side effects hit me hard so I expect this too as well. But my roommate at the time, who also got the J&J, just got covid last week and it seemed to hit him pretty hard despite being young and healthy. 
> 
> My one worry is this weird data state might break some of the vaccine verification databases. Not having a second dose of the mRNA may look like I have not completed the series and the auto verification systems could get confused.
