## California Goes From Worst to First in Virus Infections

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/california-goes-from-worst-to-first-in-virus-infections/2526050/):

> Now as cases spike in other parts of the country, California has gone from worst to first with the lowest infection rate in the U.S. even as it has moved quickly to reopen more businesses with greater customer counts and allow larger gatherings. California struggled with its vaccine rollout like other states, limiting doses to health workers and elderly who were more at risk of being hospitalized or dying. The largest mass vaccination clinic in Napa County saw demand drop from a flood to a trickle just days after California last week expanded vaccine eligibility to everyone 16 and older.

## Fake COVID vaccine cards targeted by California attorney general

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/22/fake-covid-vaccine-cards-targeted-by-california-attorney-general):

> California's acting attorney general is among the officials sounding the alarm about fake COVID vaccine cards being sold online. "Allowing users of your platform to market and sell fake vaccine cards is a threat to residents of our states," says the letter, which then demands that OfferUp remove such posts and retain information about the people who are selling the cards. The letter comes 10 days after a similar one that the attorneys general association sent to Twitter, eBay and Shopify about fake cards marketed on their platforms.

`/u/Responsible_Pin_5494` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/mwacdt/fake_covid_vaccine_cards_targeted_by_california/):

> Good. The people who are eligible to be vaccinated but don't receive them shouldn't receive the benefits that come from having the vaccine card.

## The number of Americans getting vaccinated is on the decline

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/number-americans-vaccinated-decline/story?id=77222715):

> While an average of nearly 1.9 million people a day came in to get their first dose of the vaccine during the week of April 11, the average for the week of April 16 was around 1.47 million. The drop in the weekly average could be because most Americans who were actively seeking out the vaccine already got their shot and the remaining millions of people are taking a wait-and-see approach or have outstanding concerns about the vaccines. "People have questions about the vaccine. Those questions need to be treated legitimately instead of casting them in a broad pool of people and saying, 'hey you're 'vaccine hesitant,'" the official said.

`/u/Wambo74` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/mw6hs9/the_number_of_americans_getting_vaccinated_is_on/):

> May just be a blip.  It's happened before.
> 
> Otherwise, it's approaching the time to make the vax easier to get.  To get a flu vaccination I just walk into my pharmacy at my convenience and ask for one.
> 
> May not be easy to do with Pfizer due to the deep freeze, but J&J may become available on walk-in request.  In my small town we have a half dozen pharmacies, but only one gives Covid vax.  That needs to change if you want maximum coverage.
