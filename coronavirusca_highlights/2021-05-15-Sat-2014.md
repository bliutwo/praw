## UCSF expert: California, San Francisco should 'immediately' lift mask mandates for vaccinated

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/2021-05-California-mask-mandate-CDC-vaccinated-new-16177861.php):

> After the CDC announced Thursday that individuals fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks or practice physical distancing in most settings, UCSF's Dr. Monica Gandhi - a leading COVID-19 expert - called on officials in California and San Francisco to ease mask mandates to align with the new CDC guidance. Other Democrat-led states that took similarly cautious approaches to pandemic such as Illinois and Oregon have since lifted their mask mandates for vaccinated individuals to align with the CDC. "If California doesn't adopt this new guidance even though it has a very high vaccination rate and the highest rate of children out of in-person learning, I think public sentiment will start swinging towards people believing the state took an approach that didn't follow science," she said. "If you signal in California that it's too soon to lift these restrictions, or that it's too scary still when the state has one of the highest vaccination rates and lowest case rates, it signals to the populations that there's something we don't know," she said.

## Trader Joe's drops mask requirement for the fully vaccinated

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Trader-Joes-first-grocer-to-drop-mask-mandate-16177696.php):

> Going to Trader Joe's? If you're fully vaccinated, you may not need to wear your mask as you pick up your Two-Buck Chuck. Trader Joe's is the first major grocery store to eliminate the mask requirement, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance yesterday that those who are fully vaccinated are not required to wear masks in most situations. "We encourage customers to follow the guidance of health officials, including, as appropriate, CDC guidelines that advise customers who are fully vaccinated are not required to wear masks while shopping," the grocery store writes on its COVID-19 page.

`/u/DiagonalSling` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/nclsmc/trader_joes_drops_mask_requirement_for_the_fully/):

> I'm not sure about San Francisco but Los Angeles requires customers to wear masks inside the store. Business are still required to follow local laws so nothing will change for most of California.
