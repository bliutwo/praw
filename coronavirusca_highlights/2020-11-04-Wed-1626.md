## Leading school superintendents ask Gov. Newsom to impose a ‘common standard’ for reopening schools in California | EdSource

Summary of [original article](https://edsource.org/2020/leading-school-superintendents-ask-gov-newsom-to-impose-a-common-standard-for-reopening-schools-in-california/642847/amp):

> Seven urban California school districts, including the state's four largest, have called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to adopt and pay for more stringent, uniform health and safety requirements they say should be in place before bringing students back to school during the pandemic. Calls for Newsom to take a stronger role in reopening schools, particularly collecting and publishing data on school infections and more comprehensive testing protocols, have grown louder. The superintendents are calling for the state to put in place a data collection system that would enable districts to publish a school "Covid report card" identifying a student cohort infected by the virus in a school.

> With data from the past week showing a marked increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Contra Costa County, health officials are taking steps to protect the community with modest changes to local health orders. In the meantime, Contra Costa has amended its health orders to rein in some of the riskier indoor activities permitted under the orange tier in hopes of preventing outbreaks and keeping the county out of the red. Contra Costa County's health officer issued new orders today limiting the number of spectators allowed at professional and collegiate sporting events, while also reimposing restrictions on other high-risk activities.

## More than 61,000 children got Covid-19 last week, a record

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/more-61-000-children-got-covid-19-last-week-record-n1245851?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma):

> More than 61,000 children in the U.S. were diagnosed with Covid-19 last week - more than in any other week during the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association reported Monday. The percentage of pediatric cases has risen steadily since mid-April, when children accounted for just 2 percent of Covid-19 cases in the country. Children accounted for less than 3.5 percent of current Covid-19 hospitalizations, the report found.

> Can only speak to where I’m at, but the town my wife teaches at, don’t give a fuck. I stopped there as it’s on my commute and groceries are cheap and “nope’d” the fuck right out of a local grocery store. I’d say *generously* half the store had masks on. The school has had to lie and mislead the public as well about the school’s outbreak and their handling of it. They are also not enforcing masks at any level. Even some of the teachers and admin won’t wear them, despite telling the public otherwise. This thing is going to be around for quite some time no matter who wins the election. We have an incredible amount of stupid in this country and even in our state.

## Bay Area in better shape than most of US, but vigilance still needed as COVID-19 cases rise, Stanford doctor says - ABC7 San Francisco

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-map-stanford-bay-area-covid-california/7565934/):

> While there is concern among those we talked with, Stanford's Dr. Dean Winslow says the Bay Area is in much better shape than the state and the country. While we may see certain things like water and paper towels flying off the shelves, Dr. Winslow doesn't think we'll see another shutdown, but he is in favor of a national face-covering mandate. Dr. Winslow believes there is COVID-19 fatigue out there that has contributed to the recent rise in cases around the globe.

`/u/dr_t_123` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jmqg3w/bay_area_in_better_shape_than_most_of_us_but/):

> Cases should not be the metric we use.
> 
> Positivity rate, percentage of the population known to be infected, and excess deaths are more appropriate to make informed decisions.
> 
> Absolute case numbers are inadequate and easily sensationalized.
