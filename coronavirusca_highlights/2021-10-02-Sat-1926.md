## Newsom orders COVID vaccines for eligible students, the first K-12 school mandate in nation

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-01/newsom-sets-covid-vaccine-mandate-across-california-schools):

> The mandate would take effect for grades seven through 12, starting with the school term following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's full approval of the vaccine for children ages 12 and older, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced. "The governor missed an opportunity to announce a clear and decisive mandate that all adults in public schools must be vaccinated now, failing to send a message across California that vaccination among adults is the best way to keep our kids safe," said Megan Bacigalupi, head of OpenSchoolsCA, which advocated for a swifter reopening of campuses during the last school year. A number of those reasons are factually wrong, according to experts, such as claims that the vaccine is killing more people than the virus and that the vaccine poses a greater risk to children than COVID-19.

## Most California health workers got vaccinated, but holdouts could be fired

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-01/most-california-health-workers-got-vaccinated-but-holdouts-could-be-fired):

> California health officials are relying on employers to determine which workers are vaccinated and what will happen to those who are not. While most California doctors were vaccinated against COVID-19 months ago, the inoculation rate lagged among nurses, janitors, food service workers and other hospital employees. Finding another healthcare job in California may be an uphill battle, he said: "They're going to have to have a vaccine or a valid exemption wherever they try to get hired."

`/u/illuminutcase` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pze7ha/most_california_health_workers_got_vaccinated_but/):

> Of the companies who are reporting, the percentage of unvaccinated people are in the single digits.  The big ones like Kaiser are all like 97% already in compliance, and the mandate isn't even enforced right now. 
> 
> By the time the vaccine is enforced, it'll probably be less than 1% of people who get fired.  I hope that they enforce it soon.

## San Diego Unified, state's 2nd largest district, mandates vaccination for students, staff

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-29/san-diego-unified-to-recommend-mandated-vaccines-for-staff-eligible-students):

> The new San Diego Unified rules make full COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for students when the vaccine is fully approved for their age group by the Food and Drug Administration. In its decision, San Diego Unified cited testimony from seven UC San Diego experts who support a mandate. Alyssa Titus, an educator, holds a sign at a rally protesting COVID-19 vaccines mandates for San Diego Unified staff and students.

## Update on getting replacement CDC card

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pynn81/update_on_getting_replacement_cdc_card/):

> So I posted a thread a couple days earlier inquiring about getting a replacement CDC card for my partner for international travel. Because she's eligible for a booster shot, Rite Aid and CVS said if she gets a booster shot from them, they'll give her a new CDC card with only that third shot written on it. Walgreens said no replacement card for boosters and that they'll upload the information directly into CA database.

`/u/illuminutcase` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pynn81/update_on_getting_replacement_cdc_card/):

> They're all correct.  You can't get a replacement card, you're supposed to use the digital record.  You're supposed to be able to use that for travel.  [If you look in the FAQ, it says you can print it if you need it and it should work.](https://i.imgur.com/W0LDR7S.png)
> 
> You can go to https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/ to get your digital vaccine record, if you need.
