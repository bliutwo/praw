## Federal judge orders COVID-19 testing at Bakersfield immigration detention facility

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-16/federal-judge-orders-covid-19-testing-at-bakersfield-immigration-detention-facility):

> A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered immediate testing of all detainees and staff at a Bakersfield immigration detention center where COVID-19 was spreading for weeks while officials refused to test for the virus. Lawyers for ICE and GEO reported to the court that a staff member who obtained a test outside of work was positive for the virus, the first of 14 who would eventually report positive tests taken on their own, MacLean said. The facility began testing in the first week of August, but the results of those tests have not yet been returned, MacLean said.

## New York corralled coronavirus, what’s California’s excuse for case surge? — Are Californians not taking the virus seriously enough?

`/u/Socrates_Burrito` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iayjpo/new_york_corralled_coronavirus_whats_californias/):

> New York didn't corral shit. I hate this new narrative. They got hit so hard that almost everybody that was bound to die from coronavirus did die.
> 
> NY: 1691 deaths per million
> 
> CA: 284 deaths per million
> 
> CA's peak average daily deaths has been 142. Even if 142 Californians died every day for the next year and no NYers ever died again from COVID, CA would still be doing better than NY in deaths per million (1576 to 1691).

## Does wearing a face shield count as wearing a mask?

`/u/ItsJustATux` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iaig5i/does_wearing_a_face_shield_count_as_wearing_a_mask/):

> No. Face shields provide additional protection for the wearer when combined with a mask. A face-shield alone does not protect the wearer *or the people around them.* 
> 
> This isn’t a stupid question. I’ve seen a lot of people wearing shields instead of masks. Someone will come post the science eventually, I just wanted to put it in plain English first.

## California's contact tracing efforts hampered by lack of bilingual staff

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/californias-coronavirus-contact-tracing-efforts-hampered-by-lack-of-bilingual-staff):

> In late May, just before coronavirus cases exploded across the Bay Area, Santa Clara County officials turned to the state for help beefing up their contact tracing team. Contra Costa County received one Spanish speaker, after requesting five from the state's contact tracing program. "The entire state is asking for the same criteria. It really hit California and the Latinx population, and so every county is looking for Spanish speakers," said Jenny Wang, a contact tracing leader in Alameda County.
