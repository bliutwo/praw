## Public health experts are signing an open letter stating, “We could’ve prevented 99% of all [America’s] COVID-19 deaths. But we didn’t.” the letter demanded Trump & GOP listen to experts, get priorities straight, shut the country down now to start over, and fulfill their duty to lead the country.

Summary of [original article](https://uspirg.org/resources/usp/shut-it-down-start-over-do-it-right):

> Right now we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 American lives by November 1st. Yet, in many states people can drink in bars, get a haircut, eat inside a restaurant, get a tattoo, get a massage, and do myriad other normal, pleasant, but non-essential activities. Enough daily testing capacity to test everyone with flu-like symptoms plus anyone they have been in close contact with over the last 2 weeks. The more people get sick, the more testing is required.

## Coronavirus outbreaks reported at 4 Costco stores in Santa Clara County

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/coronavirus-outbreaks-reported-at-4-costco-stores-in-santa-clara-county/):

> SANTA CLARA COUNTY, Calif. - A coronavirus outbreak at a Costco in Sunnyvale led an investigation to four different Costco locations in Santa Clara County. After reports of COVID-19 clusters at various costco locations circulated, Santa Clara County began an investigation of four Costco stores. Santa Clara County is working closely with Costco to ensure the safety of workers and customers at each location.

> I work at a Bay Area Costco. We haven’t had social distancing protocols in place for a few months now. We’ve all complained to our store management but per corporate, we aren’t allowed to have lines to get in. There are days where the crowds look like a pre-COVID thanksgiving rush. It’s complete insanity. Pair this with corporate pushing employees to do promotions like E-Blocks (where the register flags your account because you spend enough at Costco to justify the Executive membership) where employees come up to members really up close, and it is a recipe for disaster. I wonder why the government doesn’t allow some businesses to open, yet they let Costco cram thousands of people into a warehouse at once.
