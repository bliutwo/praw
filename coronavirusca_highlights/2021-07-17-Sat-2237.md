> The county averaged nearly 300 new cases a day over a seven-day period that ended Wednesday, representing an increase of 85% from the seven-day period that ended June 24. Santa Clara County dropped its death toll by nearly 23%. The county had been including in its COVID-19 death toll anyone who tested positive for the virus before or after they died, regardless of the listed cause of death. The change, which follows a similar move in Alameda County in early June, drops the overall number of COVID-19 fatalities in Santa Clara County to 1,698 people.

> See a lot of people saying that you know they don't care if unvaccinated people get sick or worse.

> I kind of understand that sentiment, everybody's had a chance by now to give vaccinated if you're eligible. But we don't want these yahoos filling up hospitals. If a bunch of dummies are all full in the ICU then people will get in car accidents or have heart attacks or whatever can't get treatment which would be a shame.

## Sheriff Villanueva won't enforce county's new mask order, claims 'not backed by science'

Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/la-county-sheriff-alex-villanueva-mask-order-los-angeles-department-of-public-health-mandate/10892664/):

> LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva is criticizing the county's decision to order masks to be worn indoors again, claiming the mandate is "Not backed by science" and contradicts federal guidelines. Starting Saturday at 11:59 p.m., all county residents are supposed to wear masks indoors under rules similar to those in effect prior to California reopening on June 15."Forcing the vaccinated and those who already contracted COVID-19 to wear masks indoors is not backed by science and contradicts the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines," Villanueva said. County officials reinstated the mask mandate after nearly a week of more than 1,000 new daily cases every day.

`/u/spriteking2012` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/olmo5z/bay_area_counties_recommend_indoor_mask_wearing/):

> What is wild about this is that in California, 99% of new infections are unvaccinated folks. Nationally, 99.7% of new cases are unvaccinated. Responsible people have carried the weight of this crisis and are being asked to do it again. It is sickening. I want to live my life again. I'm exhausted from worrying about people too stupid to get the medical miracle that is this vaccine. If they don't want the juice, if they want to risk it, if reposts on Facebook mean more to them than legions of doctors and researchers and THE FACT THAT EVERY PROMINENT MEMBER OF BOTH PARTIES IS FULLY VACCINATED....fuck 'em.

## L.A. County will require masks indoors regardless of vaccination status.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-15/l-a-county-will-require-masks-indoors-amid-covid-19-surge):

> The latest order not only puts the county further at odds with both the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - both of which continue to maintain that vaccinated people need not cover their faces indoors - but puts officials in the precarious position of asking the inoculated to forfeit one of the benefits recently enjoyed. The other city in L.A. County with its own public health department, Pasadena, already recommends that everyone - including the fully vaccinated - wear masks in indoor public settings, and the city is "Reviewing options for a mandate," according to a spokeswoman. Cases have increased rapidly since then, and county health officials now believe more direct intervention is needed.
