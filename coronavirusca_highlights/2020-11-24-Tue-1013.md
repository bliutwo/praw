## New stay-home order looms for L.A. County as COVID-19 cases soar to new highs

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-23/coronavirus-surge-pushes-l-a-county-to-the-brink-of-new-stay-at-home-order):

> The specter of another COVID-19 shutdown is looming over Los Angeles County, as a record-high number of daily coronavirus cases Monday pushed the region over its self-set threshold for issuing a new stay-at-home order. With Monday's numbers, the average number of new daily coronavirus cases over a five-day period hassurpassed 4,500, according to the county's tally - cracking the threshold that would trigger a new three-week order that, as described last week, would generally permit only essential workers and those procuring essential services to leave their homes. Last week, state officials announced a new order prohibiting most nonessential activity outside the home from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in counties that are in the strictest "Purple" tier of the state's color-coded reopening road map.

> No enforcement, no closing county borders, no clarification on what is “essential.”
> 
> This fucking morons we call “public servants” have had 9 fucking months to figure this shit out and we are just going to repeat the same things we did that didn’t fucking work the first time.

## Op-Ed: On the COVID frontlines, we're tired of hearing lame excuses for risky behavior [LA Times]

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-23/medical-workers-angry-lame-coronavirus-excuses):

> The problem is, people don't understand the danger. COVID doesn't care how you vote, where you live or if you die. People back home collected rubber and bacon grease for years, gave up countless liberties and luxuries, and no one ever called the war a hoax, even if they never saw a Nazi in their backyard.

> I am sorry Mr. Morocco but your article while well written will fall on deaf ears. If you think that public will stop getting together on Thanksgiving in few days or coming up Christmas /New York you're highly mistaken. You're also mistaken in your thinking that public will put on mask and /or will social distance once vaccine is readily available. There is only so much public is willing to do and it's not much at all. It should be evidence by now that public is only willing to do as long it do not inconvenience them, once it does they they stop complying.
