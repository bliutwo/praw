> So much for the CDC being a independent branch of the government basing their decisions on science. Even the phase 3 trials that are running aren't expected to complete until next year.

## Some Bay Area beaches will close for Labor Day. Is it worth it?

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/01/coronavirus-some-bay-area-beaches-will-close-for-labor-day-is-it-necessary/):

> All Santa Cruz County and city beaches will be shut part of the weekend and all day Monday, with similar restrictions expected throughout Monterey Bay - meaning no suntanning or beach brews to distract from scorching temperatures. Pebble Beach plans to close its iconic 17-Mile Drive and all Del Monte Forest beaches, while the Monterey City Council ratified an order Tuesday to close all beaches over the weekend. The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat watch for the Bay Area and Monterey from Friday through Tuesday, forecasting triple-digit temperatures in the South Bay, Santa Cruz Mountains and inland Monterey County, with San Francisco and the North Bay trailing behind in the mid-70s to 80s. For prior holiday weekends, beaches from Pacifica to Monterey closed down parking or otherwise curtailed access to keep hordes of people away.

> > But beware of the backyard BBQ, experts say. After the state’s surge of cases earlier this summer, including infection clusters linked to Memorial Day and Fourth of July gatherings, epidemiologists worry the beach closures could divert people towards riskier activities like backyard hangouts and indoor gatherings — while keeping Californians stuck in a cycle of back-and-forth shutdowns.
> 
> > “The beaches are not the problem,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist with the University of California, San Francisco. “The problem is really enclosed activities, with people who you’ve not had a lot of contact with, doing things where you have to take your masks off.”
> 
> State officials finally realized that closing beaches in the past was counter-productive and probably one of the reasons for the spike after Memorial Day: If beaches are closed people are going to gather indoors instead which is orders of magnitude more risky.
> 
> But that (late) realization doesn't help if counties are still deciding to close beaches. People are going to gather indoors again and I wouldn't be surprised if there's another spike in two weeks as a consequence of that.

## COVID-19 Can Wreck Your Heart, Even if You Haven't Had Any Symptoms

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-can-wreck-your-heart-even-if-you-havent-had-any-symptoms/):

> From an offensive lineman at Indiana University dealing with possible heart issues to a University of Houston player opting out of the season because of "Complications with my heart," the news has been coming fast and furiously. Though it often resolves without incident, myocarditis can lead to severe complications such as abnormal heart rhythms, chronic heart failure and even sudden death. A second patient, in her 40s, now has reduced heart function from myocarditis, and a third-an athletic man in his 40s-is experiencing recurring and dangerous ventricular heart rhythms, necessitating that he wear a LifeVest defibrillator for protection.
