## California Unemployment Rate Falls for 4th Straight Month, Regains Half of Jobs Lost in Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/06/18/california-unemployment-rate-falls-for-4th-straight-month-regains-half-jobs-lost-pandemic/):

> SACRAMENTO - California has regained more than half of the 2.7 million jobs it lost at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Friday, a trend driven by restaurants and hotels hiring more people as the nation's most populous state reopens its economy. Employers added 104,500 new jobs in May as California's unemployment rate dipped slightly to 7.9% from 8% in April. It's still one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, but it is the fourth month in a row that the state has added at least 100,000 new jobs.

> What percentage of these jobs are actually just gigs AKA Uber, Postmates, Doordash, Lyft?

"It's basically taking a card that is a physical card and digitizing it," said Gov. Gavin Newsom when previewing the technology. California bar owner arrested for selling fake vaccination cards.

`/u/MariahhCarried` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/o2u73h/california_launches_electronic_vaccine/):

> I got vaccinated through my school district, not the city/state, and they claim they don't have a record of my vaccination. I already see the problem with this "verification"

## 'Hungry to celebrate being alive': California reopening fuels job growth

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-06-18/california-reopening-economy-unemployment-dips-jobs-may-2021):

> California has added jobs at a torrid rate since the beginning of the year, but the state's economy has a long way to go before it recovers its pre-pandemic prosperity. "Even with stepped-up job growth, California has been unable to close the yawning unemployment gap with the nation." Nationwide, unemployment stood at 5.8% in May and the U.S. had recovered 66% of the jobs it lost during the pandemic.
