## As California Surpasses 30 Million Vaccines, Governor Newsom Doubles Down on Efforts to Vaccinate Hard-to-Reach Communities

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/05/04/as-california-surpasses-30-million-vaccines-governor-newsom-doubles-down-on-efforts-to-vaccinate-hard-to-reach-communities/):

> SACRAMENTO - Today, Governor Gavin Newsom announced a series of initiatives building on the state's work to vaccinate California's hard-to-reach communities against COVID-19, address vaccine hesitancy and drive innovative efforts in the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. "We're at a pivotal moment in our COVID-19 vaccine rollout - more than 30 million doses have been administered in California to date, and it's going to take some new approaches to reach those who haven't been vaccinated yet," said Governor Newsom. Counties with a population over 1 million will receive $1.5 million for every 1 million people; those with populations between 500,000 and one million will be eligible for $650,000 in grant funding; and counties with populations under 500,000 will be eligible for $350,000 in funding to expand vaccination programs and achieve equity goals.

## COVID: California's coronavirus hospitalizations hit all-time low

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/01/covid-californias-coronavirus-hospitalizations-hit-all-time-low):

> Coronavirus hospitalizations in California have dropped to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, fueled by a surge in vaccinations and one of the lowest case rates in the country. Across the 10-county Bay Area, there were just 360 people hospitalized with COVID-19, fewer than at any time of the pandemic except for a few days last June when hospitalizations briefly dropped to the low 350s. One day last week, not a single person with the coronavirus came through the Stanford Hospital emergency department. Unlike in the past, when dips in hospitalizations came with the real threat of a surge just around the corner, this decline feels more stable.

> It seems like just a few months ago that hospitals were so overwhelmed that the closest hospital to me turned their employee parking garage into the overflow non-COVID-19 emergency room.
