## Gov. Newsom withholds coronavirus money from 2 defiant cities

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/california-withholds-virus-money-from-2-defiant-cities):

> SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gavin Newsom is using new powers to withhold money from two cities in California's Central Valley that are defying his health orders by allowing all businesses to open during the pandemic. Newsom blocked nearly $65,000 from Atwater in Merced County and more than $35,000 from Coalinga in Fresno County, the first installments of $2.5 billion in federal funds that cities and counties across the state risk losing if they don't toe the line on coronavirus safeguards. The state's Office of Emergency Services sent letters to the cities last week notifying officials that they risked losing more money if they didn't withdraw resolutions defying the state's orders.

## California won't conquer the coronavirus, and fully reopen, until it can protect essential workers

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/california-wont-conquer-the-coronavirus-and-fully-reopen-until-it-can-protect-essential-workers):

> Five months into the pandemic, it's becoming increasingly clear that California is not going to conquer the coronavirus until it dramatically improves safety measures for essential workers at the epicenter of the health crisis. "We call these essential workers because the sectors they're working in are essential to the California economy. And it's essential that we figure out" how to protect them. Though Newsom's aid package increases quarantine housing for workers who can't isolate at home and provides sick leave for more workers, Rabell points out that many of those in essential jobs live paycheck to paycheck and need immediate money if they fall ill.

> The state lists the county's 14-day-case-per-100,000 residents figure at 128.3. **If the county remains on the watch list for** ***three consecutive days*** — a scenario that appears highly likely — it will be forced to close many indoor businesses including hair salons, nail salons, other personal care services, gyms, malls, places of worship, and offices for non-critical sectors.

## All California counties now have coronavirus cases as Modoc County confirms first 2

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/all-58-counties-in-california-have-reported-cases-of-coronavirus-as-modoc-county-reports-first-2):

> Modoc County, in California's far northeast corner, reported its first two COVID-19 infections Tuesday, which means that all 58 counties in the state have now confirmed at least one case of coronavirus. As cases surged throughout the state and ravaged nearby counties in Northern California, Modoc had remained untouched by the virus and, at times, defied state safety orders. Los Angeles County is one of the more than 30 counties the state is monitoring for surges in cases and hospitalizations.
