> I don't think approval by the state will take long at all if Fauci and other experts agree it is safe. This won't cause any real delay with getting the vaccine.

> NEWPORT BEACH - Newport Beach's Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian was selected as the sole site for the first phase of a clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine jointly developed by NantKwest and ImmunityBio. The first phase will include 35 adults between 18 to 55 years old, including Cao as the first patient. "Once we determine that this vaccine is safe and does what it is supposed to do, we're immediately going to move to phase 2 and 3 trials which will enroll several hundred to several thousands of patients," said Dr. Philip Robinson, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at Hoag.

> Good on the school. I live in Sonoma County and we are the most restricted county in the Bay Area. It is dumb to have parties when the pandemic is not even close to contained literally next door.

## Why does Governor Newsom want to independently review the COVID-19 vaccine before he approves it? Does he not trust it?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jfqvbn/why_does_governor_newsom_want_to_independently/):

`/u/sarcastinatrix` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jfqvbn/why_does_governor_newsom_want_to_independently/):

> I don't think it's necessarily an issue of not trusting it, rather trying to utilize additional resources to make an informed decision. Newsom is not the first governor to want an independent review of the vaccine(s), Cuomo and Inslee have indicated similar plans. With how politicized things have become, and with the dearth of misinformation campaigns, I'm not sure this is necessarily a bad thing. That said, there's obviously political posturing and PR attached to that as well, especially with the results of the upcoming election still unknown. And frankly, there's a *lot* of unknowns with this whole situation.   
>   
> For me personally, I will consider the opinions of a variety of scientists, both here and in other countries. Newsom's contingency of scientists may play a part in that, they may not. I'm very pro-vaccine in general, I have both praise and criticism of Newsom, and I'm not a fan of the fact that it seems that politics have guided other decisions in the whole Covid mess. I would not trust or mistrust any single source at this point. I also know that by the time a vaccine was available to me (not healthcare, first responder, elderly, or severe comorbidity), there will be a fair amount of information available. I wouldn't take Newsom's statement as anything particularly significant. For me, it doesn't move the needle much in either direction.

## California has escaped the national surge in coronavirus cases. But new dangers lie ahead

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-21/california-avoid-covid-coronavirus-surge-how-long-will-that-last):

> Hospitalizations rose in 42 states last week compared with the previous week - and California was not among them, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Theme parks have also stayed closed; on Tuesday, California issued strict new rules on how they can reopen, but they're so tough that the largest parks may remain shut for many more months until disease levels further drop to the least-restrictive tier - or the yellow category. California must remain concerned about the potential for a third wave.

`/u/KyleingIntensifies` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jfjcbu/california_has_escaped_the_national_surge_in/):

> We are flat.  I just don’t see any new ways to lower spread coming down in the next few months, but there are definitely reasons to think it might expand (restriction fatigue and holidays being the big one).
> 
> We may be able to avoid a huge spike like July, but I struggle to come up with scenarios where we don’t see some sort of increase over the winter.
