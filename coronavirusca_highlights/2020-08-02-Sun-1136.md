## Starting An Essential Worker (Cashier) Job On Monday. I'm Terrified

> As long as employees and customers consistently wear masks and the store is good about paid sick leave so people who are sick stay home, you should be ok. Make sure you are especially careful in your break room. I’m guessing that’s when people might take their mask off to eat/drink so maybe take your break outside or in your car if you are worried. And if it just becomes too stressful for you, there are jobs that you can do from home that may not be a long term career but can bring money for the short-medium term. I was looking into being a contact tracer for a while but ended up getting a job in my field.
