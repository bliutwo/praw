> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

## California may not reach herd immunity for years. But vaccines will make the coronavirus more manageable

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/California-may-not-reach-herd-immunity-for-years-15966616.php):

> Between the emergence of new coronavirus variants, unreliable vaccine supplies and uneven access to the doses available, it may take months or even years longer than anyone would like to hit herd immunity. It's not clear exactly how many people will need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity with the coronavirus; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has estimated 70% to 85%. But it's a moving target, based on how protective vaccines are against new variants and other factors, including the effectiveness of the vaccines on children and how long immunity lasts. Variants could complicate things and could even make herd immunity an impossible goal if the virus mutates too fast for vaccines to keep up.

> This has been true for awhile now, we're just seeing experts and leaders more comfortable talking about it now that it's close.
> 
>   
> Long before reaching literal herd immunity, the US will reach a situation where COVID is no longer an epidemic and life can go back to normal.   We'll have low prevalence, significantly less risk due to high-risk people being vaccinated, and ample supplies of treatments like mAB to handle the few serious cases that slip through the cracks.

## New optimism that COVID-19 is finally dwindling as L.A. gains some herd immunity — one of the reasons why cases are dropping so fast in California “is because of naturally acquired immunity, mostly in Southern California.” He estimated that 50% of Los Angeles County residents have been infected

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-20/covid-19-pandemic-herd-immunity-vaccinations-plummeting-cases):

> Studies have found that people who survive COVID-19 have immunity for several months, though it likely lasts even longer. Herd immunity is reached when so many people have immunity that a virus cannot find new hosts and stops spreading, resulting in community-wide protection. It remains unclear exactly what the threshold for herd immunity is with this virus with some scientists estimating that herd immunity may be achieved when 50% of people are immune, while others believe the threshold is closer to 90%, said L.A. County's Simon.

> My health insurance company has been sending me emails on this.  At least I think it is them, as it supposedly is coming from them, but so far I haven't clicked on any link.  They are sending it along with an at home Covid test kit and the ability to get set up to receive the treatment when you test positive.  I suppose doing this is a Hell of a lot cheaper for them than paying for somebody to be in an ICU on a ventilator for an extended time.   But so far I haven't signed up.
