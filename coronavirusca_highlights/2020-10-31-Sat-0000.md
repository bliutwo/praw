## To avoid a surge, San Francisco halts reopening as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations rise - SFChronicle.com

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/To-avoid-a-surge-San-Francisco-halts-reopening-15688979.php):

> San Francisco is pausing its reopening plans due to increasing coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, early signs that the surge that has swept over most of the United States is starting to spill into the Bay Area. With cases spiking in parts of California and given the massive wave of infections and hospitalizations swelling in most other states, city officials said they need to be careful about lifting more local restrictions and leaving San Francisco vulnerable to a local surge that could overwhelm hospitals. The decision to pause reopening follows a pattern - San Francisco did the same in July, when it halted plans to allow restaurants to open indoors as cases and hospitalizations surged.

> One of the things I did enjoy about the early days of lockdown was how quiet and calm things felt. It was odd being in a city without noise and I really fucking loved it.

> Same. We moved out of purple here to red, but our % has been high. My poor 4th grader is never going back to school. I don't want her to, but she's struggling and my 3rd grader has to go or lose her GATE class. I hate this year.

> I think some stores might just be having a hard time balancing between stocking shelves, pickup, and delivery.

> Went into Whole Foods in Bay Area and shelves were empty of meats, coffee, pitiful vegetable selection. I went on the prime app for that store, picked everything out that was empty shelved and got a drive up pick up for those items a few hrs later. So they were somewhere in the store, just not on the shelves in front of me.
