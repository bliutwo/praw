Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-10/california-push-covid19-vaccine-hesitancy-skepticism):

> "We're getting to a point where, if you ask people to take the vaccine, if you have the vaccine right in front of them, they'll take it," said Dr. Richard Pan, a state senator and vaccine advocate. "It's easy to think that there's something unique about people who use vaccines and people who don't," said Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver and an expert on vaccine hesitancy. Some major universities - including USC and the University of California and California State University systems - have said they will require the vaccine for students and employees.
