Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/LA-County-sees-surge-in-virus-cases-urges-16291079.php):

> The county averaged nearly 300 new cases a day over a seven-day period that ended Wednesday, representing an increase of 85% from the seven-day period that ended June 24. Santa Clara County dropped its death toll by nearly 23%. The county had been including in its COVID-19 death toll anyone who tested positive for the virus before or after they died, regardless of the listed cause of death. The change, which follows a similar move in Alameda County in early June, drops the overall number of COVID-19 fatalities in Santa Clara County to 1,698 people.

## California to require masks at school, a cautious decision that treats all students the same

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/california-to-require-masks-in-schools-despite-cdc-guidelines-theyre-not-needed-if-vaccinated):

> The new school year in California will start with students and teachers wearing masks, state officials announced Friday, staking out a cautious position on a day when new federal guidelines stressed the importance of fully reopening schools and recommended masks only for those who are not vaccinated. As part of a multilayered approach to limit the spread of COVID-19, those who are not vaccinated should wear masks indoors - and schools, health departments or states may continue to require masks on campus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In May, the CDC said that Americans in general don't have to be as cautious about masks and distancing outdoors and that fully vaccinated people don't need masks in most situations.

> I’m curious about when we won’t have to wear masks. I can tell you that teaching with a mask on makes it so much more difficult for language learners and those who struggle with hearing (which is a lot more than you’d think because of ear buds causing damage).

## L.A. County has more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases in a day, highest in months

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/la-county-1000-coronavirus-cases-day-highest-in-months):

> Los Angeles County reported more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day on Friday - the biggest such report in months. The last time L.A. County reported more than 1,000 new cases in a single day was due to a backlog of cases in late May. In early March, the county was routinely posting new coronavirus cases of more than 1,000 a day. With 1,060 new cases reported Friday, according to a preliminary Times tally, L.A. County was averaging 598 new cases a day over the past week, a significant increase from a month ago, when the county was reporting fewer than 200 new cases a day.

> 
> >COVID-19 hospitalizations are also rising in L.A. County. The record low for COVID-19 hospitalizations was posted June 12, when 212 were in the hospital, a 97% decrease from the peak of the pandemic Jan. 5, when 8,098 people were in hospitals.

> 
> >“With increased COVID-19 transmission among unvaccinated people, [the Department of] Public Health encourages those that are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination and not yet vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay,” county officials said in a statement. “It takes time before you are considered fully vaccinated. For all of the vaccines, you are only considered fully protected two weeks after all doses are complete. Vaccination is the best protection against this disease.”
> 
> For those unable to get vaccinated, we still wear our masks for you. For the others, we have no more words.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/reopening-holiday-travel-revise-bay-areas-downward-covid-19-case-trend/2590859/?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_BAYBrand&amp&__twitter_impression=true):

> "People need to anticipate we're gonna see more and more cases, I don't think anything catastrophic but we're gonna see more people getting sick, getting hospitalized and dying," said Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Jon Swartzberg. Stanford Health Care is requiring staff to be vaccinated by August 15. "We're seeing hospitals push that again you shouldn't be in a hospital as a health care worker if not vaccinated because you're a risk to yourself and sick people," he said, adding that if the virus continues to spread, the highly contagious Delta variant won't be the only threat.

> “If you're producing billions of viral particles because you're infected and not immunized, some of those particles are going to become variants that will survive,” said Swartzberg.”
