Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/LA-County-sees-surge-in-virus-cases-urges-16291079.php):

Santa Clara County dropped its death toll by nearly 23%. The county had been including in its COVID-19 death toll anyone who tested positive for the virus before or after they died, regardless of the listed cause of death. The change, which follows a similar move in Alameda County in early June, drops the overall number of COVID-19 fatalities in Santa Clara County to 1,698 people.

> An Evangelical/Born-Again Christian guy was tired of "not living their life" during a pandemic.   
> They prayed for God to protect them.  
>   
> Soon, the guy sees a doctor on the TV saying: "masks aren't perfect, but wearing them greatly cuts down on transmitting the virus."  
>   
> Next time the megachrcher went to the store and was offered a mask by an employee, "I don't need one of the liberal media's socialist face-diapers,   
> I'm praying to God and He won't let me catch it.   
>   
> Even if I do, it's basically a cold and He won't let me die." So the employee moved on.  
>   
> Then he tried talking to his neighbor, a nurse camped out in her back yard to protect her family, and she said "there isn't a vaccine yet,   
> so be sure to practice social distancing whenever possible."  
>   
> To this the megachurcher said, "Screw that, I have Ted Nugent tickets tomorrow night and I'm not gonna live my life in fear like all these other sheeple. I have faith."   
> So, the nurse decided to go back to her tent and try to sleep.  
>   
> Then, while in the drive-thru at Whataburger, a doctor said on the radio: "we've finally got a vaccine; they're extremely effective and available pretty much everywhere for free."  
>   
> To this megachurcher yelled at his radio, "Pfft, those people before didn't know anything, and my uncle posted a photo on FB of one of them watching a baseball game without a mask.   
> I'm taking zinc supplements and praying to God, I have faith."  
>   
> Soon the megachurcher caught the virus during Applebee's all-you-can-eat stuffed jalapenos night, got extremely sick and died. He went to Heaven.   
> He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed,   
> "I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me catch the virus. I don't understand why!"  
>   
> To this God replied, "I sent you a mask and a message to socially distance and a free vaccine, what more did you expect?"

## COVID spreading fast in well-vaccinated California counties

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/07/24/covid-spreading-fast-in-well-vaccinated-california-counties/):

> A Bay Area News Group analysis shows not only are cases rising fast in much of the Golden State, they are soaring in many urban counties that boast high vaccination rates. Five California counties have both a higher percentage of their eligible residents fully vaccinated and a higher average daily case rate than the statewide average: Los Angeles, San Diego, Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco. There have been mixed reports about the vaccines' effectiveness against the variant, most of which indicate they still offer broad protection, and case rates show the fully vaccinated remain well protected.

> Mine has the complete wrong name on it and they have yet to fix it. I have complained to Kaiser and filled out all the info three times on the website. Still nothing. I’m really worried if they do come up with a scanner I’ll still not be allowed anywhere. 
> 
> My mom got the shot same time as me and code doesn’t show up either. No one is doing anything.
