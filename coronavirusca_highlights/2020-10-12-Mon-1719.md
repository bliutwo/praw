> Fuck those people...and fuck whoever lets them in the store. I was in Target and saw someone one with no mask walk by. I ask a staff why they just let them go, and they said that they are not allowed to ask them to leave.

## California kept prison factories open. Inmates worked for pennies an hour as COVID-19 spread

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-11/california-prison-factories-inmates-covid-19):

> Amid the drive for production, factories continued to operate even as infections increased inside prison walls, according to interviews with more than 30 inmates at the women's prison in Chino and at Avenal State Prison for men, including some who became infected with the coronavirus. On April 1, the 11-member Prison Industry Board met and agreed to pay prison laborers overtime - though one board member worried that inmates would slow down production "Just to get into the overtime." Statewide, prison authorities say they do not track infections of incarcerated workers separately from the general population, so it is unclear how many of the 15,121 inmates who have tested positive worked in factories or other jobs.

## School reopenings, hybrid learning look different across CA | CalMatters

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/education/2020/10/school-reopening-hybrid-learning-california/):

> In Poway, one of the largest California school districts to attempt reopening campuses, elementary students learning in person will attend their school in cohorts for part of each weekday - either morning or afternoon - and learn asynchronously, or on their own, the rest of the school day. Giving families the option to choose between a hybrid, or blended, model - meaning students split their time learning on campus and at home - and full-time remote learning appears to be the course that many of the state's school districts are charting toward. Hybrid models vary widely across the state, with some school systems offering to bring students back one day a week, others planning on doing so on alternating days and still other schools planning on five days a week under a shortened schedule.

> I chose 100% Online for the exact reason why this comment thread exists. I’m not dealing with the sh*tshow of an unpredictable school year. My kid isn’t a guinea pig for some possible future case study of why there was an outbreak among schools.
