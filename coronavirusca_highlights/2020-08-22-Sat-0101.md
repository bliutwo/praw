## The surprising story of the salesman who became L.A.’s first known COVID-19 patient — He first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Los Angeles was a man from Wuhan, China, who was hospitalized in a secret ward in January and remained the sole patient diagnosed with the virus here for five weeks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-08-21/surprising-tale-first-la-covid-19-case):

> The father, Qian Lang, became the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Los Angeles and the fourth in the United States. Authorities were reporting hundreds of new cases, and rather than downplaying the threat, officials were preparing to lock down the city of 11 million to stop the virus' spread. Told of Qian's connection to Wuhan, his symptoms and the sudden death of his mother-in-law, CDC personnel at the airport suspected the virus and called for a Los Angeles Fire Department ambulance specially equipped for COVID patients. By mid-February, COVID had crept around the world and was starting to ravage South Korea and Italy, but Qian was still L.A.'s only known case.

> > The family arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on the way home from a Mexican vacation that had been short-lived and unpleasant. They had been exhausted, the father was battling a nasty stomach bug, and even before they settled into their Cancun hotel, they got word of the sudden death of the wife’s mother in their hometown: Wuhan, China.
> 
> > The couple and their toddler son wanted to get back for the funeral and planned to be at LAX just long enough to switch planes. But as they passed through Tom Bradley International Terminal on Jan. 22, the father was overcome with a fever and body aches and approached a customs officer for help.
> 
> > The family did not make their flight that Wednesday night and, indeed, would not return to China for more than a month. The father, Qian Lang, became the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Los Angeles and the fourth in the United States. He remained the sole patient diagnosed with the virus here for five weeks, passing most of that time in top-secret isolation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
> 
> > The 38-year-old salesman played an important role, not widely known until now, in a frantic race to understand the deadly new virus before it hit the United States in full force. Public health officials and researchers looked to him as a real-time, flesh-and-blood case study.

## City of Imperial votes to reopen businesses

Summary of [original article](https://kyma.com/news/2020/08/21/city-of-imperial-votes-to-reopen-businesses/):

> IMPERIAL, Calif., In a 5-0 vote the City of Imperial has passed a resolution to deem all businesses essential and allow them to reopen. The mayor of Imperial asked all business owners to open up with caution and said he believes local businesses can take care of their customers better than big-box chain stores. "We don't believe stage four businesses need to wait four more months to reopen. They can't do it anymore. We believe that we should be able to move right now with commonsense precautions. How do we know it's common sense because they came from public health. It's the plans they said we must follow to be safe in our operation," said Darrell Pechtl, DARRELL PECHTL, Imperial Mayor.
