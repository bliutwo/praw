## Leading school superintendents ask Gov. Newsom to impose a ‘common standard’ for reopening schools in California | EdSource

Summary of [original article](https://edsource.org/2020/leading-school-superintendents-ask-gov-newsom-to-impose-a-common-standard-for-reopening-schools-in-california/642847/amp):

> Seven urban California school districts, including the state's four largest, have called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to adopt and pay for more stringent, uniform health and safety requirements they say should be in place before bringing students back to school during the pandemic. Calls for Newsom to take a stronger role in reopening schools, particularly collecting and publishing data on school infections and more comprehensive testing protocols, have grown louder. The superintendents are calling for the state to put in place a data collection system that would enable districts to publish a school "Covid report card" identifying a student cohort infected by the virus in a school.
