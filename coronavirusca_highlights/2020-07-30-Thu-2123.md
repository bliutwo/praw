## Coronavirus outbreaks reported at 4 Costco stores in Santa Clara County

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/coronavirus-outbreaks-reported-at-4-costco-stores-in-santa-clara-county/):

> SANTA CLARA COUNTY, Calif. - A coronavirus outbreak at a Costco in Sunnyvale led an investigation to four different Costco locations in Santa Clara County. After reports of COVID-19 clusters at various costco locations circulated, Santa Clara County began an investigation of four Costco stores. Santa Clara County is working closely with Costco to ensure the safety of workers and customers at each location.

> I work at a Bay Area Costco. We haven’t had social distancing protocols in place for a few months now. We’ve all complained to our store management but per corporate, we aren’t allowed to have lines to get in. There are days where the crowds look like a pre-COVID thanksgiving rush. It’s complete insanity. Pair this with corporate pushing employees to do promotions like E-Blocks (where the register flags your account because you spend enough at Costco to justify the Executive membership) where employees come up to members really up close, and it is a recipe for disaster. I wonder why the government doesn’t allow some businesses to open, yet they let Costco cram thousands of people into a warehouse at once.

## San Francisco’s lonely war against Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/30/21331369/london-breed-coronavirus-covid-san-francisco-california-trump):

> New York City would go on to suffer one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world, with its total death rate standing, as of July 29, at 272 per 100,000 people - more than 45 times as high as San Francisco's rate of 6 per 100,000. Restaurant data from OpenTable shows San Francisco was starting to avoid dining out by the first week of March, while most other cities in the US saw at best small decreases, if any changes: On March 1, dining out via OpenTable was down 18 percent in San Francisco, compared to down 3 percent in Los Angeles, down 2 percent in New York City, up 2 percent in Houston, and up 21 percent in Philadelphia. So while San Francisco has done a lot right, it will take the rest of the country adopting a similar approach for the city, the broader Bay Area, or anywhere else in the US to really be safe from the coronavirus.

> I don't understand the focus on SF.  The Bay Area as a whole has done well and SF has one of the smallest populations of the Bay Area.
