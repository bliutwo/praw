## Report: Gavin Newsom's team 'increasingly concerned' about recall efforts

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/YeOldeSir` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kajeho/report_gavin_newsoms_team_increasingly_concerned/):

> Virtually nobody is happy about the current leadership during the pandemic...  The reality is that we're currently in a lose-lose situation until a large enough portion of the population either get sick/recover (not a good idea) or get the vaccine.
> 
> Some people want stronger restrictions and actual enforcement of public health mandates.  Other people want fewer restrictions because they either feel that the blanket restrictions are unfair to business or they feel ignorantly believe that the public health threat of the virus is overblown.
> 
> If the recall supporters get their way, and Gavin is pulled from office, and somehow magically replaced with someone who is more "pro-small business" and in favor of fewer restrictions, then the virus is just going to snowball to the point that its so bad that they can no longer ignore it...
> 
> ...And then people will be calling to recall that person, AND most of the struggling small businesses will continue to struggle and/or die their inevitable deaths.
