> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

> The responsibility for enforcing the health orders has really been passed around to zero positive effect. It often comes down to the willingness of your city/county Board of Supervisors having the strength of character to issue fines. And most don't.

## Governor Newsom Signs Legislation to Ensure Access to Supplemental Paid Sick Leave for Workers Impacted by the Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/19/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-to-ensure-access-to-supplemental-paid-sick-leave-for-workers-impacted-by-the-pandemic/):

> Legislation creates uniform, statewide policy to ensure employees have access to COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave through September 30, 2021. SACRAMENTO - Building on the state's action to expand paid sick days protections for California's workforce during the pandemic, Governor Gavin Newsom today signed SB 95, legislation to ensure access to up to 80 hours of COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave for eligible employees, including those advised to quarantine or isolate and those caring for COVID-impacted family members. "Under AB84/SB95, workers can rest assured they will be able to take time off if they or a loved one gets sick, need to quarantine or attend an appointment to be vaccinated. California's essential workers who have not had the privilege to stay home during the pandemic are deserving of protections that ultimately save lives. Combined with other initiatives implemented by the state to support workers and their employers, paid sick leave will help ensure California remains on the right track as we continue to make progress to safely reopen the state."

## California still trails many states in COVID-19 vaccinations amid shortage of doses

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/california-still-trails-many-states-in-covid-19-vaccinations-amid-shortage-of-doses/):

> COVID-19 vaccines have gone into Californians' arms at a record rate this week, a promising acceleration that comes even as officials continue to warn of constrained supplies in the near future and as the state stubbornly lags behind many others in how widely the doses are being distributed. During that stretch, roughly 2.35 million doses were administered statewide - including 344,489 on Thursday and 387,015 on Friday. The recent torrent of inoculations belies the major challenge that has and will continue to stymie the race to vaccinate as many Californians as quickly as possible, at least in the immediate future: a shortage of supply.

> It'll be sooner than that AND there will be people who continue to become eligible before then.  For example, the 50+ year olds in Solano county.  I expect multiple counties will open it up before then.
> 
> Regardless, we're weeks away.  Not months.  Not years.  Weeks.
> 
> Stay safe.  Don't die now.  Keep your  guard up and keep being responsible.  Don't squat and take a shit 5 yards before the finish line, no matter what politicians might say from either party.
