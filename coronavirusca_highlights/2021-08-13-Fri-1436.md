> Here we go again... How about we mandate that all travelers have negative test AND a vaccine to enter the US? Why do we need to let in every variant and wait to see how it works against vaccines? We don't even have mandated quarantines for people.. and please don't tell me we do because no one is checking.

## Delta variant leaves Angelenos reassessing how to live their lives

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-13/delta-variant-leaves-angelenos-reassessing-how-to-live-their-lives):

> Now, as the Delta variant surges, Savas is still going to the gym - the Peloton bike at home doesn't quite cut it. Even mild ones, can cause lingering health problems, and fully vaccinated people can spread the Delta variant to others. Concerns about the Delta variant pushed the hotel manager to cancel his upcoming flight.

## Nearly 10% Of Covid Cases Lead To Hospitalizations In LA County

Summary of [original article](https://patch.com/california/cerritos/s/hqa2a/nearly-10-of-covid-cases-lead-to-hospitalizations-in-la-county?utm_source=alert-breakingnews):

> Ferrer said there has been a 240% increase in hospitalizations over the past month among unvaccinated people aged 50 or over, and a 237% rise in hospitalizations for unvaccinated younger residents. She added, "Trendlines like these are why we feel so certain the vaccines are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing here in L.A. County. Vaccinated people are exceptionally well protected from hospitalization. Although we have seen cases rise among vaccinated people and hospitalizations rise, it is hard to even draw a comparison between the experience they have with COVID and the severe illness the infection continues to cause among those unvaccinated." Ferrer said statistics show that unvaccinated people are 3.6 times more likely to become infected with COVID than vaccinated people.

> I wonder whether people have to use their health insurance for covid related expenses. Or it’s free from government, hope not.

## How do I add my Carbon Health Pass to my Apple Wallet?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/p3ge71/how_do_i_add_my_carbon_health_pass_to_my_apple/):

> The directions simply say "Login to your Carbon Health account and click on 'add to Apple wallet.'" This is very clearly not an option that seems available anywhere on the app - at least for me. My app is up to date, both of my shots were from Carbon, and the first one was in April, which seems to be after this integration went live. Both of my shots say "Verified", and I've got a QR code.

`/u/FuzzyLaughter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/p3ge71/how_do_i_add_my_carbon_health_pass_to_my_apple/):

> On my app, it says “Your Health Pass is ready” on the home screen, with a green button that says “View Card.” When I click on the green button, it takes me to my health card. When I scroll all the way down, it has the “add to apple wallet” button.
