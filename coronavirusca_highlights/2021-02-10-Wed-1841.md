> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

> Did these clinics have proper storage for the vaccine? They may not have the resources to store the vaccine or store enough of it to make shipping there worth it. With vaccine availability low, those kind of decisions have to be considered.

## Thread from the Chair of Medicine of UCSF with a great overview of where we stand

Summary of [original article](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1359362463578296321.html?fbclid=IwAR3lVbl0YSy2Zf0JwTlxN_gPkJpbTRmRH2K3Rxs_z3TgXgiz_KpHTdN4GfY):

> 12/ With all of these positive trends, we should be heading toward a sunny future, w/ falling cases, rising vaccine rates, & prospect of herd immunity & "Back to normal" soon. 14/ The falling case rates have to be viewed in the context of the steady rise in the fraction of cases caused by B117 variant - the one that's, famously, ~50% more transmissible. For the SA and Brazilian variants, we must do all we can to prevent them from gaining a toe-hold here - mostly by keeping cases down.

`/u/chef_dewhite` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lh0vb8/thread_from_the_chair_of_medicine_of_ucsf_with_a/):

> I agree for the most part with this assessment.  It won't be until late March before we know how the country will fare in the later spring or early summer depending on the trajectory of cases and spread of the new variants. If we keep things at bay, we should be in good shape.

## First cases of South African coronavirus strain found in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-10/first-cases-of-south-african-coronavirus-strain-found-in-california):

> California's first cases of infection caused by the South Africa coronavirus variant have been confirmed in the San Francisco Bay Area, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. Although currently available vaccines appear to be effective against most of the coronavirus variants that have been identified to this point, the strain fueling a resurgence of COVID-19 in South Africa was not slowed down by a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Given how easily that variant can spread, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict it could become the dominant coronavirus strain nationwide by the end of March.

## More contagious South African coronavirus strain found in Santa Clara and Alameda counties

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/10/south-african-covid-strain-found-in-santa-clara-and-alameda-counties/):

> The worrisome South African strain of coronavirus, which appears to be more contagious and more resistant to some vaccines, has surfaced in California, and the first two cases are Bay Area residents. Experts say the South African strain is up to 50% more contagious than other variants. On Wednesday, South African health officials said they will begin using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine instead. Tests showed that vaccine, which is pending approval in the United States and expected to be given the green light later this month, was 57% effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 against the South African variant, and 85% effective at preventing severe disease.

> San Diego and Santa Clara counties got roughly 180 doses per 100,000 residents while Riverside County got 100 per 100,000, Saruwatari said. San Diego County, which has roughly two and a half times the number of health care workers as Riverside County, got 13% of the statewide vaccine allocation while Riverside County got less than 5%, she added.
