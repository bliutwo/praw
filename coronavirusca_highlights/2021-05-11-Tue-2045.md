## Shorter lines and TikTok ads: California’s push to beat vaccine hesitancy

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-10/california-push-covid19-vaccine-hesitancy-skepticism):

> "We're getting to a point where, if you ask people to take the vaccine, if you have the vaccine right in front of them, they'll take it," said Dr. Richard Pan, a state senator and vaccine advocate. "It's easy to think that there's something unique about people who use vaccines and people who don't," said Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver and an expert on vaccine hesitancy. Some major universities - including USC and the University of California and California State University systems - have said they will require the vaccine for students and employees.

> Tik Tok is the wrong place to advertise if you want to reach the vaccine hesitant. More like Infowars, if there is even ad space available other than that foe boner pills.

## Just 2% of SARS-CoV-2−positive individuals carry 90% of the virus circulating in communities

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2104547118):

> Regardless of symptomatic status, ∼50% of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 seem to be in noninfectious phases of the disease, based on having low viral loads in a range from which live virus has rarely been isolated. By summing the viral load across individuals based on the interpolated probability density function representing each population, starting with those with the highest viral loads, we find that just 2% of individuals harbor 90% of the circulating virions. One potential explanation for the differences in viral loads between individuals is that individuals were simply tested at different stages of otherwise similar viral infections.

> I'm shocked at the overlap in viral load between asymptomatic students and hospitalised patients. This has recalibrated how I think about SARS CoV 2, thank you OP

## Pfizer vaccine for teens: US FDA authorizes Covid-19 vaccine for people ages 12 to 15

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/pfizer-vaccine-for-teens-us-fda-authorizes-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-ages-12-to-15/ar-BB1gAcDX):

> The US Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorization for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine on Monday to include people ages 12 to 15. This is the first Covid-19 vaccine in the United States authorized for use in younger teens and adolescents; the vaccine had previously been authorized for people age 16 and older. Pfizer said last week it expects to submit for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 2 to 11 years old in September.

`/u/nutmac` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n9gtfu/pfizer_vaccine_for_teens_us_fda_authorizes/):

> [FDA's fact sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download) indicates both the vaccine and doses for 12 to 15 are exactly the same as adults, 0.3 mL 3 weeks apart.
> 
> This would suggest that given the ample supply in most counties, California can open up appointments for 12 to 15 almost immediately after CDC gives their blessing.
