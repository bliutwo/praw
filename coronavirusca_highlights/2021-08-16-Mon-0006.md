## California's vaccinated say unvaccinated are adding risk; strong support for mandates — CBS News poll

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-vaccinated-say-unvaccinated-add-risk-opinion-poll/):

> There is strong support for making vaccines mandatory for health care workers, and a lot of support for letting businesses that draw crowds also mandate that their customers be vaccinated. Support for mandates is even more prevalent among those fully vaccinated in California and among them, support rises to the 80-plus percent range. Nor is "No" doing overly well with many key constituencies that Democrats count on in California white voters with college degrees aren't as definite about turning out as non-college, and Hispanic likely voters are split.

Dr. Anita Sircar takes a moment to talk with one of her COVID-19 patients, Angel Cordero, 19. "OK. We'll go check on them." Sircar paused.

## L.A. County reports more than 4,200 new coronavirus cases as Delta variant continues to spread

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-14/vaccinated-l-a-county-residents-are-14-times-less-likely-to-be-hospitalized-with-covid-19-than-unvaccinated):

> Los Angeles County health officials on Saturday reported 4,229 new coronavirus cases and 21 related deaths as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread, noting that unvaccinated people are nearly four times more likely to get infected than those who are fully vaccinated. "Common-sense precautions are warranted by everyone at this time, in part because fully vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant can transmit the virus to other people. Fully vaccinated people are encouraged to use caution in crowded and indoor settings, especially around unvaccinated people outside of their household." Last month, L.A. County reimposed a rule requiring masking in indoor public spaces amid the surge of new infections fueled by the Delta variant.

> They periodically go back and make sure that COVID deaths are classified as deaths where the virus was a contributing factor.  If the deceased individual died while being COVID positive, but the virus did not appear to contribute to cause of death, then they remove that case from the count, hence the negative numbers.
