> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

## PSA: If your local CVS is administering Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and you aren’t eligible to be vaccinated, sign up for their wait list. My wife and I did 10 days ago and got vaccinated today.

## Tesla's California plant saw more than 400 COVID-19 cases between May, December

Summary of [original article](https://nypost.com/2021/03/14/teslas-california-plant-saw-more-than-400-covid-19-cases/):

> Hundreds of COVID-19 cases have been reported at a Tesla plant in California since it reopened last year against county health orders. Cases of the potentially deadly virus at the electric car maker's plant in Fremont have soared since it restarted production May 11 - despite orders by the Alameda County Health Department to shut down businesses, the Mercury News said. Officials at Tesla and the Alameda County Health Department did not respond to requests for comment, the Mercury News said.

> I'm certainly non pro-Musk, but is this any higher than would be expected given how many employees they have there? Is there evidence of outbreaks within the factory itself instead of isolated infections? The NY Post is a straight up rag, and just about the least in-depth source you could possibly cite.

## California healthcare workers didn't know they were fighting a new variant this winter. Their trauma should be a warning.

Summary of [original article](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/california-healthcare-workers-didnt-know-120200694.html?guccounter=1):

> Blackmun-Myers didn't know it at the time, but a new coronavirus variant had been overtaking the region. Blackmun-Myers and three other Southern California healthcare workers say what they saw this winter should serve as a strong warning. "Practically every one of my patients, either they've been infected, or many of their family members have been infected, they know somebody very well who has died or gotten severely sick," Pettersen said.

> NorCal nurse here. We definitely had it here too. Almost every patient we had got it and they weren’t technically exposed. Only thing they shared was the same air system. That’s how contagious it was.

## Millions more Californians will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccine. But they face obstacles

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-13/vaccine-high-risk-eligible):

> The expansion marks an important step for the state's emergence from the pandemic, and new guidance released Thursday by health officials allows high-risk people to self-attest to their eligibility - a key win for advocates who worried that people would not be able to gather documentation to verify their disability or underlying condition. Further straining tight supplies: The state on Monday is also expanding eligibility to people who live or work in high-risk congregate residential settings, such as homeless shelters and incarceration facilities, and to public transit and airport employees. The new guidance's allowance for self-attestation clears up confusion about how high-risk people can prove their eligibility.

`/u/alldayhangover` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/m4hqx6/millions_more_californians_will_be_eligible_for/):

> People are going to line jump. Whats gonna stop people from saying "I have diabetes"? The people administering the shots cant deny them I would imagine.
