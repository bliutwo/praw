> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

## CA vaccination rate has been picking up pace

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/l8ui3d/ca_vaccination_rate_has_been_picking_up_pace/):

> While there are still plenty of areas for improvement, it's encouraging to see the vaccination rate has been improving. Per 100 people in total population, CA is now 4th nationally in daily doses administered. In share of population fully vaccinated against covid, CA is about the middle of the pack with just 1.23%. There're plenty of room for improvement as CA has only administered about 52% of the allocated doses.

`/u/InkslingerS` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/l8ui3d/ca_vaccination_rate_has_been_picking_up_pace/):

> While excellent news, I'll be more heartened once I have confidence that our vaccine _supply_ isn't dwindling at the same time.
