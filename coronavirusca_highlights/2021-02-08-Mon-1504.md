> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

## The United Farm Workers union says it has not been able to get vaccine appointments for workers in the wake of California's decision to prioritize inoculation of people over 65 years of age, after first saying it would emphasize the labor sector.

> The state plans to continue vaccinating school personnel, emergency services and health care workers as well as food and agriculture workers as it transitions into the new age-based system, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said last week. United Farm Workers, the large labor organization, said it has not been able to get vaccine appointments for its workers through the state's online portal. Latino officials and labor advocates are echoing these concerns about the shift in tiers, saying these changes are putting Latino essential workers and their families at risk when counties throughout California are lifting restrictions.

> 75% of deaths are from the 65+ age group with 20% from the age group below that.  If this is about saving lives, age should be the way to go.  It will never be 100% fair or perfect so go with data and science- go based on who’s dying from this and get them safe first.

> Based on that set up, I’m pretty much towards the end.  I have to go to work everyday and might be considered essential but I’m ok with this.  The data is on my side that I’d fare better then someone double my age.
