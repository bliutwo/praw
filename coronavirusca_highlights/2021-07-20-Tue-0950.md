## L.A. County coronavirus spike hits alarming levels, with 10,000 infected in a week, as Delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-19/l-a-county-coronavirus-spike-hits-alarming-levels-with-10-000-infected-in-a-week-as-delta-variant-spreads):

> Los Angeles County is now recording more than 10,000 coronavirus cases a week - a pace not seen since March - an alarming sign of the dangers the Delta variant poses to people who have not been vaccinated and heightening pressure on health officials to reverse the trend. L.A. County is the only county to make it a requirement, while much of the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Sacramento, Fresno and Yolo counties, have made the plea a recommendation. The rise in cases comes as the pace of weekly vaccinations in L.A. County has fallen to disappointing rates, with about 80,000 first doses of shots administered per week in June, below the county's goal of 100,000 first-dose shots a week.

> Over this shit. So frustrated. I'm vaccinated, masked up, and there is literally nothing else I feel like I can do. Like wtf.

## California’s COVID surge would vault a dozen or more counties to restrictive purple tier

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/07/19/californias-delta-covid-surge-would-vault-a-dozen-or-more-counties-to-widespread-purple-tier/):

> At the January peak of California's deadly winter COVID-19 case spike, all but four rural counties were in the purple tier. Under the revised rules, the purple tier applied to counties with 7-day average daily case rates of 10 per 100,000 people or more. On June 15, when the state ended its tier system, no California counties remained in the purple tier, and just one was in the red, while 29 were in the yellow tier.

> I mean if you look at the graph of Santa Clara county it says 76.7% of those 12+ have gotten both shots, cases are still way down and deaths as well. I would imagine as things opened up those who remain unvaccinated would get the virus causing a rise in cases. I’m theorizing that there will be an uptick then another decrease

## Wary and Weary, Los Angeles Largely Accepts Restored Mask Mandate

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/us/la-masks-covid.html):

> Most customers dutifully took their masks on and off at the entrance of shops, where signs were posted to remind them of the policy and where, in some cases, complimentary masks were offered. Out-of-state tourists found themselves wearing masks for the first time in months, sometimes annoyed but largely compliant, and one restaurant employee who forgot about the mandate was able to secure a mask by running across the street and asking employees at the Starbucks if they had extras. In June, just two weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom lifted California's mask mandate as part of the state's "Grand reopening," county health officials released a statement "Strongly" recommending that all vaccinated people wear masks indoors, despite eased restrictions.

> So masking up when we go out, or just going out less in general, seems like a small sacrifice to help protect them from covid.
