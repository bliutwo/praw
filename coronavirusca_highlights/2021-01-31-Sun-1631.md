## Audit finds small California counties received less COVID relief from state

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/01/31/audit-finds-santa-cruz-other-small-counties-received-less-covid-relief-from-state/):

> SANTA CRUZ - Santa Cruz County, and other small counties like it, were short-changed out of coronavirus relief funding in 2020. According to a published report by the auditor of the State of California, the state's Department of Finance allocated significantly less funding from the $1.3 billion allocated to the state through the CARES Act to counties with 500,000 residents or fewer than its 16 largest counties. The 42 small counties received just $102 per person, while the 16 large counties received $190 to $197 per person from the financing approved in May meant to provide relief to those suffering financial losses from the public health emergency.

> Yeah, the same counties that refused to close, refused to follow mask mandates, refused, refused, refused. Screw the politicians, sheriffs, and right-wing extremists who screwed it up for the reasonable, community-oriented people in those places.

## Sacrificing equity for speed? California’s COVID vaccine rollout stirs concern

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/01/sacrificing-equity-for-speed-californias-covid-vaccine-rollout-stirs-concern/):

> It's not hard to see why health equity advocates are increasingly concerned about emerging disparities in California's vaccine rollout - the same kind of inequities laid bare in so many other aspects of the coronavirus pandemic. Some health advocates now fear California is sacrificing equity for speed. The state's vaccine working group experts initially proposed allocating vaccine doses first to health clinics in communities scoring low on the state's Healthy Places Index, which evaluates income, insurance coverage, education, pollution, density and other factors affecting residents' health.

`/u/orwell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/l9l0ur/sacrificing_equity_for_speed_californias_covid/):

> Last place Vaccination State: Majority of people... what a failure, speed up vaccination CA
> 
> .... CA speeds up vaccination by not trying to be perfect ....
> 
> 
> Now A leading Vaccination State: whoa CA, why you letting people die. Get more targeted...

## How the coronavirus flooded California and swamped L.A.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/projects/connecting-california-covid-cases-la-surge/?utm=false):

> The last weeks of October saw a slight uptick in cases across the state, soon followed by an unprecedented surge. On Nov. 13, 292 days after that late night press release was issued by Orange County officials, the state surpassed 1 million coronavirus cases. One year after the crisis began, Southern California - particularly Los Angeles - again has the highest concentration of cases.

> Excerpt: 
> 
> > At the time, there were only four known cases in the United States. Some leaders, including the president, gave assurances that the virus would soon be snuffed out.
> 
> > They were wrong. There have been 26 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths nationwide. In California, more than 3 million people have tested positive and 40,000 have died.
> 
> > The Times has been tracking the numbers since the pandemic’s earliest days. A look back on the first anniversary of the outbreak shows how the spread across the state unfolded in four distinct chapters, leading to a massive winter swell which the state is still recovering from.
> 
> > The virus made its first footholds in the San Francisco Bay Area, where several cruise ships carrying infected passengers were quarantined at sea.
> 
> EVERYBODY mishandled the cruise ship passengers plus folks returning to California from Asia. 
> 
> PLUS folks flying in from Europe after the Italan outbreaks.
> 
> AND blame the state for poor contact tracing with the early outbreaks.
> 
> In hindsight there were so many missed opportunities to get a better handle on COVID-19 early on. :(
