## Newsom announces new preventative measures for essential workers

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/Newsom-sick-leave-covid-19-worker-guidelines-15432311.php):

> California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday new safeguards for essential workers who have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, including temporary housing for infected workers to quarantine. Even with the stay-at-home order in place, Newsom said our state still depends on millions of essential workers such as farm and construction workers, delivery truck drivers, cooks and cashiers. The state will expand its Project Roomkey program to provide temporary housing for essential workers who are infected and need a place to quarantine.

> And they didn't test staff or patients enough, too.
> 
> But that all goes back to not enough test kits, which goes back to problems at the CDC.
> 
> Plus I'm pretty sure the Feds were also shortchanging California on test kits at the time.
> 
> Which is just one of the many reasons we need a 9-11 style commission to investigate the US response to COVID-19 after Trump leaves office.

> It's so inconsistent my wife got laid off and approved in the same week while others get on hold for 3+ months.
> 
> My guess is when it auto-approves it works fine but some cases are more complicated and EDD doesn't have time to review them all.
