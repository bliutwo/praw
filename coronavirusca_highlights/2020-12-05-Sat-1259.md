> ...and basically nothing has changed.  Retail is open which means that the public will perceive business as usual.  If you can head down to Best Buy to shop for televisions, are you really in a "lockdown?"

> Is it a full on shutdown like the one back in March or the 20% of the capacity bs which we have now in LA?
> Cause whatever we have right now absolutely hasn’t made any difference at all. Same amount of people outside and same amount of line every where. 0 difference

> I understand the data on the graph, but have no idea what it implies. Can someone ELI5?
> 
> Edit: Ok. I believe I read an article on a similar topic. It supports the scientific consensus that covid is possibly a little worse a killer than the covid reported numbers due to deaths that go Uncategorized. I wasn’t sure if this graph was attempting to suggest something else.

## So Christmas IS canceled, right?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k7d9ob/so_christmas_is_canceled_right/):

> If I am reading the order correctly, since gatherings of ANY size are prohibited, that does effectively mean that all forms of holiday parties are off limits, AND typical Christmas gatherings that involve bringing multiple family member "Units" into the same home? Basically what they "Strongly recommend" we do at Thanksgiving is now mandatory under the order, is that correct? Regardless of whether or not people will follow it and cancel their family holiday gift exchange etc, that IS what the order means? Three weeks takes us to after Christmas. Also the leisure travel ban is telling people who fly home for Christmas to not go back to California.

> They can order people to stay home all they want but it won't matter because no one enforces it. I fully expect tons of Christmas gatherings anyway.

## CA Smashes New Covid-19 Cases Record, Infections Rise By 16% In Day

Summary of [original article](https://deadline.com/2020/12/california-coronavirus-new-covid-19-cases-record-22018-16-percent-jump-in-day-newsom-lockdown-1234650663/):

> The day after California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a new "Regional Stay at Home" plan that will take effect tomorrow, the state reported a 16% jump in new daily Covid-19 infections, at 22,018. For comparison, California reported 4,566 new daily Covid infections on 11/4. One month later, that number has surged over 380%. This week's Thursday-to-Friday jump is one of the largest day-over-day case count increases of the pandemic. New deaths on Friday were up.7% from the day prior, a number that is sure to rise markedly as California moves into the darker part of December.

## California On The Brink: COVID-19 Rages And Closures Are Imminent. Critics say a broad statewide “stay-at-home” order unfairly lumps too many disparate counties together into regions.

> SAN FRANCISCO - Much of California is on the brink of sweeping new restrictions on businesses and activities, a desperate attempt to slow the frighteningly rapid escalation of coronavirus cases that threaten to overwhelm hospitals. The new order divides the state into five regions and uses ICU capacity as the trigger for closures. The approach "Places our ability to reopen with 10 other counties including Los Angeles County which has absolutely failed to control the coronavirus and Mono County whose most populous city is 344 miles away," said Fred M. Whitaker, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County.

> Idk I really think it makes a lot of sense when you think about how many counties help each other out when ICUs reach capacity
