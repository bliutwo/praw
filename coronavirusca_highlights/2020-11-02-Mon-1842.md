## Bay Area in better shape than most of US, but vigilance still needed as COVID-19 cases rise, Stanford doctor says - ABC7 San Francisco

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-map-stanford-bay-area-covid-california/7565934/):

> While there is concern among those we talked with, Stanford's Dr. Dean Winslow says the Bay Area is in much better shape than the state and the country. While we may see certain things like water and paper towels flying off the shelves, Dr. Winslow doesn't think we'll see another shutdown, but he is in favor of a national face-covering mandate. Dr. Winslow believes there is COVID-19 fatigue out there that has contributed to the recent rise in cases around the globe.

> Cases should not be the metric we use.
> 
> Positivity rate, percentage of the population known to be infected, and excess deaths are more appropriate to make informed decisions.
> 
> Absolute case numbers are inadequate and easily sensationalized.

> It is understandable why John Oliver went all in. Those of us who have had close relatives and friends catch covid, we have seen what they have went through, and the emotional rollercoaster that we go through. It sucks to feel like you can't do anything, while another person suffers. I wish Trump supporters would listen to people who supported him and then caught covid. Most say they were duped or that they now are taking it seriously. Thank you Mr. Oliver, we hear your pain and we feel your pain.

> You're not crazy, America is crazy.   Very few of us are doing the responsible thing.   Those out partying are ensuring that the deaths and illness continues and gets worse.   
> 
> America has been revealed as selfish and ignorant.   We've been brought to our knees because we can't show a tiny amount of common courtesy.   A tiny sacrifice of people being minorly inconvenienced by wearing a mask and social distancing was too much to ask for America. 
> 
> Sooooo here we are things are getting worse.

> I think businesses will begin to close at sundown in November, there will be a lot of Halloween parties this weekend, protests will become an everyday thing again, and we still wonâ€™t see any unemployment aid.
