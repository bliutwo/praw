## 'I've seen people die.' COVID-19 slams Central Valley hospitals, as many resist lockdowns

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-13/san-joaquin-valley-coronavirus-hospitals-many-resist-lockdown):

> In Stockton, in the northern part of the five-county San Joaquin Valley, some small-business owners are demanding a reprieve from closures, arguing that this third round is arbitrary and unfair. "The hospitals are not overflowing because of restaurants," said Johnny Hernandez, co-owner of the Black Rabbit gastropub in Stockton, who joined a protest with other small-business owners Thursday on the steps of Stockton's City Hall. "My own neighbor told me they thought COVID wasn't real - a scam for hospitals to get money from the government," he said.

> They are going to resist lockdowns when they aren’t getting paid. Congress failed us. Mitch is the devil. Fucking someone do something...

## Bay Area county launches door-to-door testing amid 'dire' surge — Santa Clara County launched a door-to-door coronavirus testing effort this week to curb a pandemic that's spiraling out of control.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Santa-Clara-County-door-to-door-COVID-testing-15795717.php):

> Santa Clara County launched a door-to-door coronavirus testing effort this week to curb a pandemic that's spiraling out of control. "For the last few months, we have been working with community partners to do outreach and engagement. We recognize there's fear and mistrust about COVID-19 and especially testing and what people can expect if they test positive. We have been focused on bringing testing into neighborhoods and households as another opportunity to mitigate the barriers to accessing a test." Garcia said the community leaders going to homes for testing are bilingual and have a history of engagement in the community.

> The text alerts are for emergencies only, not to harass people to do something they aren't going to do anyway.  If that system is abused it won't be respected when needed again in the future.
> 
> I think paying businesses for their lost sales is the only way to get people to stay home, but then how is that funded?  There's no simple answer, but a lot of people seem to be living in lala land and don't seem to understand people need to pay rent and buy groceries.  Until the COVID naggers can explain how to help people who are suffering financially good luck getting them to listen to you.

> I know that once, Trump used herd mentality instead of herd immunity so now people joke about that.
> Outside that herd mentality is when the actions of other people cause you to do the same, so I guess if everyone around you wear masks, wearing a mask won't be that hard to do.

## East Bay businesses sue to overturn COVID-19 outdoor dining ban

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/11/east-bay-businesses-sue-to-overturn-covid-19-outdoor-dining-ban):

> A group of businesses in Contra Costa County filed a lawsuit Friday against the county's health department to overturn its ban on outdoor dining. In the wake of a similar court challenge in Southern California, a judge earlier this week ruled that Los Angeles County acted "Arbitrarily" in enacting its own outdoor dining ban. In the Bay Area, about 17% of cumulative ICU beds are currently open, but Contra Costa and several other counties in the region chose to ban outdoor dining now rather than wait another week or two for the inevitable filling of available beds.

> It was here all summer and never was an issue until now, but gotta blame something I guess?
