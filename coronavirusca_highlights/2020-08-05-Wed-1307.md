## California's reported decline in infection rate may not be accurate, official says

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/510625-californias-decline-in-infection-rate-may-not-be-accurate-official-says):

> California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly on Tuesday said that the state's decline in its coronavirus infection rate may not be accurate due to technical glitches in the state's data system used to process test results. On Monday, Gov. announced that California's seven-day infection rate had dropped more than 20 percent in the span of a month to 6.1 percent. Ghaly said California Department of Public Health officials are trying to determine "Where data is getting stuck."

> She was in a nursing home and someone brought it in. Other people that have died now I'm grieving more. Anyone else out there lost someone to Covid? How are you doing?

> I just lost my grandfather to Covid as well. 86, someone tracked it in, we think staff possibly. Gets admitted to to local hospital where lack of family oversight (I believe) contributes to inconsistent treatment and care. Get shuffled out of hospital and into hospice when he meets certain criteria primarily so he doesn’t die on site necessitating a flood of documentation (I’m told). Died alone in his isolated care home bedroom. Discovered deceased at 430a when care nurse checked in on him at start of shift. The most social, gregarious and talkative man I’ve ever personally known and he died alone in an empty room.

> I didn’t have the patience to read the article. I went to it because the Times has a history of posting sensational headlines that do not match the reporting. I think basically the summary is something like “Governor makes decisions using the best data he has at the time which is based on estimates due to a backlog in testing.”
