They have had out breaks since the pandemic started they have also had deaths and June and July they have had numerous covid cases and my mom included. The day my mother called out July 13, 47 other employees called out sick for the first time due to covid. That was just one day and every day after they had reported cases. Employees where started to get scared and hoping they wouldn’t be next. The health departed payed them a visit last week and found that everything was compliant. Finally today the health department shut them down. Well they make all the food for this fast food chain in this state and most of Western U.S. so if they can’t produce food for them they might have to close locations depending how long this shut down last. In all honesty the health of the employees is what matters my mom has several coworkers in the hospital.

I kept telling my mom to eat lunch outside or alone in her car I even got her a portable table and chair so she can keep in her and pull out during lunch."
