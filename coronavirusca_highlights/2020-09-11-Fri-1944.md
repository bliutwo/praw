## COVID-19 Etiquette How to Deal People Who Refuse to Wear Face Mask

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27253/20200911/covid-19-etiquette-deal-people-who-refuse-wear-face-mask.htm):

> Public healthcare workers require people to wear face masks to protect themselves and other people. Since there are no federal laws that mandate the usage of masks, people nonetheless should follow this guideline, especially if they are going to be near other people. Since most people work at home, one should not expect a library-like silence from all people as this is often next to impossible.

## 9-month-old died of COVID-19: When they say kids are safe, this is a reminder. ðŸ˜¢

Summary of [original article](https://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2020/07/20/first-child-dies-covid-19-minnesota-cases-rise-922/3287548001/):

> There were two causes of death listed in the case: upper and lower respiratory tract infection and a nasal culture positive for COVID-19, said Infectious Disease Division Director Kris Ehresmann. "In general, we've seen fewer cases in kids. We've seen fewer cases with hospitalizations and fewer cases with a need for intensive care," Ehresmann said. Children under 6 make up 2% of Minnesota cases, and people under 20 make up 10%. People in their 20s make up 23%, but only two in that age group have died.

`/u/Weinerslingshot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iq59fs/9monthold_died_of_covid19_when_they_say_kids_are/):

> When they say "kids are safe" they are just regurgitating Russian and GOP talking points. How can we know anything about something we have been dealing with for 8 months. This whole thing is so fucking stupid, can't we all just agree that we need to find out a lot more about this disease before we can say anyone is safe. I swear sometimes I think I am the one losing my mind. Then I remember why I left Facebook and remind myself there is a giant misinformation campaign being carried out by our own government. We have a tough road ahead of us.
