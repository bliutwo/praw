## State says most college classes must be online

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailydemocrat.com/coronavirus-california-releases-guidance-for-reopening-universities):

> The guidance does not mandate COVID-19 testing for students and staff, telling universities only to "Consider routine systematic testing of staff or students for current COVID-19 infection, and procure resources to test exposed IHE student and staff if exposed." Only specialized courses like labs and studio arts classes will be allowed to take place in person in counties on the monitoring list, and universities are recommended to hold smaller courses in larger rooms, outside or with synchronous distance learning options. Newsom's office did not respond to a question on how, or if, the state plans to enforce its guidance for universities.

> State has been signaling this since May when they said all California State University classes would be online in the fall.  Anyone who didn’t see this coming had their head in the sand.

> Nice to see a government official take responsibility, admit that a mistake occurred, and lay out the fix and how things will be better. He should be praised so that others aren't encouraged to cover-up or suppress mistakes in the future.

`/u/orwell` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i5hpvn/edd_director_under_fire_after_admitting_the/):

> We all realize and agree this is not a good situation, but keep in mind the details:
> 
> *" that the EDD only answers five percent of the 11 million customer phone calls it gets each week."*
> 
> That means they are answering 550,000 calls a week...  That's 78,571 answered calls/day. 
> 
> At some point it's just not physically possible to answer calls... And, I would say they are waaay beyond that point.
> 
> Edit: for some saying , hire/do more, from April:
> 
> *Last week, Gov. Newsom announced the ranks of the EDD’s unemployment insurance unit had swelled to 1,340 employees, including 740 EDD employees and 600 employees from other state government agencies.
> 
> Prior to the changes, the phone lines were being answered only from 8 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday. Now phones are being answered 84 hours a week compared to the previous 20 hours weekly.*
> 
> Since April they've probably done even more... They've hired more, they work more hours. Given the once in a 100 years demand, there's only so much that can be done within the existing system.

> The state failed to renew a certificate (SSL?) and data from one of the major labs could not be processed for 5 days. In addition they now have a backlog because of a technical change that was supposed to be temporary. We have the largest tech companies and smartest engineers sitting in this state - why is this happening?
