## After voting for dining ban, LA County supervisor dines out at local restaurant

Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/la-county-dining-ban-coronavirus-covid-19-supervisor-sheila-kuehl/8402376/):

> SANTA MONICA, Calif. - On the same day she warned about the dangers of eating at restaurants and voted to support the shutdown of in-person dining in Los Angeles County, Supervisor Sheila Kuehl dined at a restaurant in Santa Monica. Kuehl then went to dine in-person at her favorite restaurant, Il Forno in Santa Monica. "Like so many people in Los Angeles, she has a favorite place to eat and is saddened that so many restaurants are suffering from lost business. Since the restaurant patio ban went into effect, she is doing everything she can to continue to support the restaurant, ordering takeout nightly. She hopes other County residents will take similar steps to support their favorite restaurants while we get through this challenging period."
