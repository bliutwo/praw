Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-taken-off-states-coronavirus-watch-list/2387632/?fbclid=IwAR3QIOtqW5wLRJ-5oLhuiyDzUvEMukEE_xFcqAmLXxebW3U5NPCfm-JsUcc):

> Following several days of data trending in a positive direction, San Diego County has been taken off of California's monitoring list. The state announced that as of Tuesday, San Diego County has been removed from its watch list since it's been three days that the county has had an average of less than 100 cases reported per 100,000 residents. What it does mean is that schools K-12 will be able to reopen for in-person education as soon as Sept. 1 if San Diego County can remain off the state's watch list for another 14 days.

> 
> Is there no limit to the confusion and delays?  Why would businesses not be able to reopen?
