> WASHINGTON - The Pentagon will deploy more than 1,100 troops to five vaccination centers in what will be the first wave of increased military support for the White House campaign to get more Americans inoculated against COVID-19. National Guard leaders told The Associated Press that they are now considering training additional Guard members to give shots, so that they can also expand vaccinations in more remote and rural portions of their states. Guard leaders said the close to 100 mobile vaccination teams already active are delivering more than 50,000 shots a day.

## Governor Newsom Statement on Increased Federal Support from Biden-Harris Administration for COVID-19 Relief Programs in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/02/05/governor-newsom-statement-on-increased-federal-support-from-biden-harris-administration-for-covid-19-relief-programs-in-california/):

> SACRAMENTO - Governor Gavin Newsom today issued a statement commending the Biden-Harris Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency for extending the federal cost share to now fully reimburse California and other states for emergency relief programs and National Guard personnel deployments dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In guidance first released last week and further clarified by federal leaders in recent days, it is now the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to provide state and local governments reimbursement for emergency costs for FEMA-eligible services - including the cost of National Guard personnel mobilization, the purchase of personal protective equipment, emergency feeding programs and sheltering at-risk populations - at a 100 percent rate dating back to January 2020. "Through the leadership of President Biden and his Administration, this change will allow our state to deliver lifesaving services during the ongoing pandemic. These actions also provide direct relief to local government partners working on the front lines of this pandemic," said Governor Newsom.
