## Riverside County officials say slowdown in coronavirus case growth is misleading

Summary of [original article](https://www.pe.com/2020/08/03/riverside-county-officials-say-slowdown-in-coronavirus-case-growth-is-misleading/):

> A technical problem with California's coronavirus reporting database is giving the false impression that the rise in new Riverside County cases is slowing, county officials said Monday, Aug. 3. Lab data is not being submitted to the CalREDIE database in a timely manner, making it look like the county's case growth in recent days is leveling out, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari said in a news release. Here are the latest numbers, according to county and state public health officials.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latinpost.com/articles/146721/20200803/law-enforcement-personnel-went-bar-party-los-angeles-without-covid.htm):

> First Posted: Aug 03, 2020 06:06 AM EDT. Around 100 to 150 law enforcement personnel went into a bar party in Los Angeles without following COVID-19 precautionary measures like social distancing and wearing a facemask. On Friday night, dozens of people or between 100 to 150 law enforcement personnel or first responders attended a party at a Los Angeles bar. Strangis declined to name the attendees of the bar party.

> It's a clickbait article that is only half-true.  The party was for law enforcement as well as first responders. 
> 
> I think COVID is just going to get worse and worse in the US.  The American people have NEVER been good at following good health guidelines. Americans eat to obesity, we drink too much, we have lost every drug war, we are still losing the opioid war.

> It’s encouraging to see that hospitals are doing better and in many counties some numbers are starting to fall. I suspect we are past the peak of infections and hospitalizations resulting from 4th of July parties and we are starting to see that, as well as the positive consequences of more widespread mask wearing and bar closures. I’m uneasy though, because we are now only one month away from Labor Day weekend, gatherings from which could undo some of this good progress.

## Should I go camping this year due to COVID-19?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i3but5/should_i_go_camping_this_year_due_to_covid19/):

> My family and I booked a spot back in January, before the virus got very serious in the US. We were supposed to go this weekend, but should we? We will also maintain social distancing while hiking at all times. Is it safe though? We're in the Bay Area and will be going camping nearby.

`/u/Facemanx64` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i3but5/should_i_go_camping_this_year_due_to_covid19/):

> You will not stay overnight, will leave in the morning, and return...at night. But not bring a tent?  
> 
> Um. Camping is pretty socially distant as is. We ran into no one. Closest tent was dozens of feet away. I guess it all depends on where you go.
