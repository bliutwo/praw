## California orders 5,000 body bags, refrigerated trucks on standby as COVID surges

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/5000-body-bags-ordered-refrigerated-trucks-standby-covid/story?id=74741632):

> California ordered 5,000 more body bags and has dozens of refrigerated trucks on standby as the state experiences its "Most intense" COVID-19 surge to date, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday. Statewide, ICU capacity is at 5.7%. The San Joaquin Valley and Southern California regions have ICU availability under 2%. When a region hits 0% ICU capacity, surge staffing and surge management go into effect, Newsom said. The governor's briefing comes a day after the state administered its first COVID-19 vaccine dose in Los Angeles County, and thousands of doses are being rolled out across the state.

> And?  Loan size was based on number of employees.  Add their salaries up, with a max salary of $100,000, with a max of $10 million.
> 
> Did your essential business that doesn’t actually need to be at the office request a loan even though you’re not hurting right now?  Well, you’re dumb if you didn’t.    The idea that covid isn’t going to hit your business eventually is crazy.  Where is the second round of PPP loans?  Should have gotten your loan while you could...

> They were shutdown, so of course they should request a loan.

## Tribal casinos remain open as Southern California adjusts to COVID-19 stay-at-home order

Summary of [original article](https://www.desertsun.com/story/money/business/tourism/2020/12/12/tribal-casinos-remain-open-socal-adjusts-shutdown-order/6495025002/):

> Tribal casinos across Southern California remained open this week, even as many businesses in the region were forced to shutter or pare back services due to new stay-at-home orders from the state. Six outbreaks, meaning three or more associated COVID-19 cases, have been recorded at Riverside County casinos between June and November, according to county spokesman Jose Arballo Jr. Four different casinos each had one outbreak, while a fifth casino has had two. Casinos could be considered high-risk environments for COVID-19, as described by six public health experts in a ProPublica article from August, which examined casinos in Las Vegas.

> Finally somebody is reporting on this. This article has casino management worried. This is the most under reported story of the pandemic, especially the case numbers they are hiding.
