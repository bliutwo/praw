> I’ve counted 10+ times of seeing folks cover their nose with their shirt at the entrance at different places over the past two months. As soon as they’re deep into the store/pharmacy/smoke shop, they just walk around normally without using the shirt to cover themselves. It’s ridiculous.

> After the original April wedding was postponed because of coronavirus concerns, they wrote on their wedding website, the couple rescheduled for July. "Following up on an email I sent you on Saturday, we have confirmed that the leadership of Ss. Peter & Paul Church attempted to hold a large gathering for a wedding inside the church on July 4, 2020 - a violation of the Order of the Health Officer," Ryan wrote in a July 7 letter admonishing the archdiocese for the event. The guest who posted on Instagram about the wedding marveled at all the couple had overcome for the pandemic wedding.

> The clergy should be fined or arrested for aiding in continuing services even after they were given lawful orders to stop. Fuckers don’t pay taxes, we better make sure they follow our laws.

## 'Shut it down now:' U.S. health experts call for 2nd coronavirus shutdown

Summary of [original article](https://abc7chicago.com/second-shutdown-covid-coronavirus-doctor-letter/6334320/):

> The letter, published on the United States Public Interest Research Group's website and penned by its public health campaigns director Matthew Wellington, blames the push to reopen the economy for the country's worsening health crisis and calls for all nonessential businesses to close. Dr. Travis Porco, an ophthalmological biostatistician and professor at the University of California, San Fransisco, said he signed the letter. The letter includes a list of recommendations for what's needed to reopen American cities - once it's safe - calling for enhanced testing capabilities, more contact tracers and more personal protective equipment.

> "There's nothing that's ever been less political than the coronavirus," Dr. Porco said. "I mean, the coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. Or what your religion is, or what your ethnicity is. We're just food to that thing."

## I'm a Covid-19 'long-hauler'. For us, there is no end in sight | Jemma Kennedy | Opinion

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/im-a-covid-19-long-hauler-im-still-dealing-with-pain-fatigue-and-misery):

> Frustratingly, my tests revealed the "Normal" blood, heart, lung and organ function typical of long-haulers. Will long-haulers be eligible for state financial support and free specialist medical care beyond the 12 weeks offered by the NHS? Can we avoid the battle faced by chronic fatigue or ME sufferers, our closest cousins, who have historically found it difficult to a) get diagnosed, b) treated and c) recognised as even having a bona fide disease? George, a friend and fellow long-hauler, fought her GP for weeks to get a chest MRI, knowing that her lungs weren't working properly.
