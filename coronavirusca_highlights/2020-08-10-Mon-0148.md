## Why the time to get back COVID-19 test results in Bay Area ranges from 2 weeks to 2 days

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/A-lost-opportunity-Some-Bay-Area-test-15468141.php):

> Delays in coronavirus test results from some Bay Area sites worsened this week, taking up to 19 days in the worst cases and frustrating officials trying to contain the summer's surge in cases. In the Bay Area, the time it takes to get back test results can differ drastically depending on where you live, who's running the site and which lab is processing the results. "COVID-19 cases have been rapidly rising across the country, putting immense pressure on reference laboratories, like the ones we partner with, to process a high volume of tests," the statement read. "We recognize that the timely return of results is critical." The company said it is onboarding two additional labs to improve capacity and turnaround times, hopeful to return to a previous average of closer to two days and up to five days.

## Covid tracking apps

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i6ruqq/covid_tracking_apps/):

> I'm a firm believer in covid tracking apps and am amazed California isn't leveraging this technology. The apps pose no real privacy concerns as there's no geotracking and data is anonymized. Although California hasn't released their app, is there any benefit from downloading an app from Canada or Virginia and using that? If enough people use it, perhaps we can derive some benefit.

> California's government is sadly not competent enough to pull off an app like this.
