## Coronavirus: More than 10,200 LAUSD students choose independent study, won’t return to campus

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailynews.com/2021/08/06/coronavirus-more-than-10200-lausd-students-choose-independent-study-wont-return-to-campus/):

> More than 10,200 Los Angeles Unified students had enrolled in the district's independent study program for the upcoming school year as of Friday morning, Aug. 6 - a nearly eightfold increase in enrollment compared to before the coronavirus pandemic - according to a district spokeswoman. The number of students that had signed up for the City of Angels independent study program by the close of the business day on Friday was not immediately available, but as of the morning, 10,280 pupils, or just over 2% of district students, had enrolled, the spokeswoman said. Although the percentage of students planning to learn through the independent study program is low, the nearly eightfold increase in enrollment signals that thousands of families aren't yet willing to send their children back to campuses, despite repeated insistence by district officials that schools are safe spaces during the pandemic.

`/u/MixedTheFuckUp` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ozm22c/coronavirus_more_than_10200_lausd_students_choose/):

> "Independent study" should not be confused with "distance learning" or "remote learning". Shame on LAUSD for offering such a weak replacement for all of the students and families who choose not to return to campuses. I hope parents speak up and demand better from the district. 
> 
> They got millions for reopening schools in the spring and defunding the police. At least some of that money could go to providing a viable distance learning option. Especially, since they also spent god-knows-how-much on technology for hybrid learning.
