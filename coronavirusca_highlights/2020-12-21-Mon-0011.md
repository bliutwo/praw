## Dr. Fauci: COVID-19 vaccines should allow California colleges to teach in-person next fall

Summary of [original article](https://localnewsmatters.org/2020/12/20/dr-fauci-covid-19-vaccines-should-allow-california-colleges-to-teach-in-person-next-fall/):

> While coronavirus cases are surging across California and overwhelming intensive care units, the country's top infectious disease expert said Dec. 18 he's "Cautiously optimistic" that college students can return to campus in the fall. The university, one of the first nationwide to pivot to online education this spring, announced last week it expects its nearly 500,000 students will return to in-person learning in the fall of 2021, citing the progress on producing COVID-19 vaccines. Currently, most CSU campuses do not require across-the-board COVID-19 testing - as the University of California and a number of private colleges have done - though San Diego State University has recently mandated testing for students living on campus and taking in-person classes.

> Seems reasonable, its still 9+ months away and our most vulnerable will likely be vaccinated by then. Or dead. Either way it should be fine.

## Grocery stores, essential businesses hit hard by COVID-19 - Los Angeles Times

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-20/coronavirus-outbreaks-los-angeles-grocery-stores-essential-businesses):

> Supermarkets have been hit hard by the unprecedented explosion of the coronavirus in Los Angeles County, further straining an essential service that needs to remain open despite the new stay-at-home order. Those at grocery stores and other essential retailers pose a unique challenge for officials attempting to reduce coronavirus transmission, as well as for county residents trying to pare down their activities to only what is necessary. County officials have tried to limit the potential for outbreaks at stores and last month dropped the maximum capacity allowed at grocery stores and other essential retailers to 35% and to 20% at all other retailers as part of a stay-at-home order.

> So glad Joel Osteen’s megachurch got millions of stimulus dollars though.
