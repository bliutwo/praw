> I know we are a very populous state so this isn’t a huge surprise but based on how many people refuse to wear masks and refuse to stay home it’s not surprising that things are as dire as they are. People think California is so liberal. Anywhere you go in California that’s not a large city feels like Trump country. It’s sickening how many people are out shopping with masks around their chins. So much for our progressive state.

> It’s about the per capita. It’s why we lead the country in case numbers but not cases by per capita.

## Fight against COVID-19 hits wall of defiance in rural California: 'The excuses just go on'

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/rural-northern-california-coronavirus-defiance):

> In California's conservative northern counties - where a sense of rural abandonment by the state government has long had residents wanting to form a new state called Jefferson - the region is, in some ways, now a victim of its own early luck in the pandemic. The Northern California region - which includes Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama and Trinity counties - has been the only one of the five state-designated regions to not be placed under a stay-at-home order based on hospitals' intensive care unit availability. Of Northern California Health Officers, a coalition of 11 county health officers, who said they were "Gravely concerned" that hospitals could be easily overwhelmed.

> COVID-19 fight hits defiance, suspicion in rural California - Los Angeles Times
> Jan. 18, 20215:30 AM
> Jeremiah Fears sat beneath an elk head mounted on the wall of the volunteer fire department in his little city and rolled up his sleeve for what he hopes is a step toward normality: his first dose of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.
> 
> “If we can get vaccinated and do our thing to protect one another and ourselves, we can hurry up and open and go from there,” said Fears, chief of the Corning Police Department. “I know there’s controversy behind it. But it is what it is.”
> 
> Fears had come to a vaccination clinic in Corning — population 7,600 — aimed at firefighters and police officers. But in that fire station was a hint of the pandemic skepticism that runs deep in rural Northern California: two elderly people, both on dialysis, who were coming to get their shots.
> 
> They had been put on standby because Tehama County health officials, who only brought two small vials containing 20 doses, suspected they might not attract enough firefighters or police officers to use them all.
> 
> A water tower with the word Corning on it is seen at night
> Corning is in Tehama County, where indoor dining is banned by the state, but some restaurants were still seating maskless customers.
> (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)
> In the battle against COVID-19, health officials in Northern California face the daunting task of vaccinating more than 683,300 people spread across a mountainous, heavily forested region where calamity — either from illness or physical trauma — can mean hours-long drives to the nearest medical facility.
> 
> Among their biggest obstacles: overcoming widespread skepticism that the virus is a serious threat in far-flung towns, fear that the new vaccine is unsafe, and open rebellion against health orders. The pushback in rural parts of California is emblematic of the challenge in many parts of the United States, particularly outside more liberal urban centers.
> 
> “We’re getting very frustrated here in Northern California,” said Dr. Richard Wickenheiser, the Tehama County health officer. “We have a lot of anti-vaxxers and a lot of independent people who just feel that COVID was a hoax, that it was going to go away when the election was over. And that didn’t happen. ... The excuses just go on and on.”
> 
> Public health messaging, he said, “isn’t working.”
> 
> In Shasta County, some speakers at supervisors’ meetings have compared mask mandates to Nazis forcing Jewish people to wear a yellow Star of David and spouted conspiracy theories about vaccines containing tracking devices. The county health officer has been threatened repeatedly.
> 
> In Tehama County, where indoor dining is banned by the state, restaurants were still seating maskless customers in recent days. In downtown Red Bluff, signs in store windows read: “Please respect everyone’s personal space. ... Masks are welcome, but not required” and “Due to pre-existing health conditions, some of the staff are not wearing a face mask” and “MASKS OK.”
> 
> There is skepticism and defiance across the Golden State. But in California’s conservative northern counties — where a sense of rural abandonment by the state government has long had residents wanting to form a new state called Jefferson — the region is, in some ways, now a victim of its own early luck in the pandemic.
