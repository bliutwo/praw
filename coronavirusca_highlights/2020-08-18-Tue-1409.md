## Coronavirus: California hospitalizations fall below 5,000 for first time since June

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-california-hospitalizations-fall-below-5000-for-first-time-since-june):

> The Bay Area had cut its hospitalizations by nearly 20% from their peak, but rather than continue that decline, the region has added a net of 50 patients in the past eight days. At their respective peaks, the per-capita rate of hospitalizations in the Bay Area was less than half that in Los Angeles County. The spread had closed to a rate of 13.5 active hospitalizations per 100,000 population in LA and 9 per 100,000 in the Bay Area, compared to respective rates of 22.3 per 100,000 in LA and 10.3 per 100,000 in the Bay Area about a month ago.

## Getting mask shamed at a National Park

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ibmh3n/getting_mask_shamed_at_a_national_park/):

> I'd say there were about 75% of people wearing masks and 25% not. The part that is really bothering me is people making really rude comments to us and probably others FOR wearing masks while in front of our children. It's just so frustrating that people feel okay with using bad language in front of kids wearing masks and basically directing the comments at them too since it was our entire family they were shouting at.

> Insane. You’d think that someone not wearing a mask wouldn’t want to confirm their self-centered, thoughtless nature. :/

## San Diego County Taken Off State's Coronavirus Watch List

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-taken-off-states-coronavirus-watch-list/2387632/?fbclid=IwAR3QIOtqW5wLRJ-5oLhuiyDzUvEMukEE_xFcqAmLXxebW3U5NPCfm-JsUcc):

> Following several days of data trending in a positive direction, San Diego County has been taken off of California's monitoring list. The state announced that as of Tuesday, San Diego County has been removed from its watch list since it's been three days that the county has had an average of less than 100 cases reported per 100,000 residents. What it does mean is that schools K-12 will be able to reopen for in-person education as soon as Sept. 1 if San Diego County can remain off the state's watch list for another 14 days.

> And 3 days ago we had our 3rd highest ever.  There's a weekly cycle and we're a low point today.  Our active cases are still climbing, so I'm not impressed.
> 
> I got a test today.  6-10 business days isn't good enough.
