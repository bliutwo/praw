> Are you sure the baby bust isn't because we can't afford to have children and a place to live? Or children and food? And the pandemic just made it evident? That's why I don't have kids, I want them, but I also want to live under a roof.

## A dozen counties criticized OptumServe for vaccine clinic problems, documents show – California authorized paying OptumServe up to $221 million. But the company has helped with only 1% of the state’s vaccinations since January.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/05/counties-criticized-optumserve-for-vaccine-clinic-problems/):

> Officials from at least 12 counties complained to the state Department of Public Health about delays and other problems with OptumServe, saying that the problems hampered their ability to get shots into arms, according to state documents obtained through a Public Records Act request. OptumServe still has a vaccination site in Tulare County, but it is no longer working with the county, and county officials are in the process of taking their doses to redistribute to other partners. In Kern County, where Newsom initially announced the opening of the new OptumServe sites initiative, Brynn Carrigan, director of the county's Public Health Services Department, said complications with those sites were, in part, due to problems with the state's MyTurn vaccine scheduling website.

## Half of L.A. County residents 16 and older now fully vaccinated for COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-24/half-of-l-a-county-adults-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19):

> Half of Los Angeles County residents 16 and older are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, an encouraging milestone as the region - along with the rest of California - prepares to fully reopen in a few weeks. "This is only made possible due to our residents' hard work to bring down cases and hospitalizations. And it's also due to the willingness of residents across the county to get vaccinated as quickly as possible." As of Friday, 46% of county residents 16 to 64 had been fully vaccinated, including only 28% of those who are either 16 or 17, according to figures Ferrer presented.

> in case anyone is wondering, the most recent numbers ive found from over a week ago say that 61% are partially vaccinated and 47% were fully vaccinated, which means that about 10% are probably waiting for their 2nd dose

## California essential workers: What do you think about the end to the mask mandate?

`/u/greatnowimannoyed` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/nkqi1i/california_essential_workers_what_do_you_think/):

> Love it. It has to end at some point. 90% of people over 65 have received their dose, and organizations like the one I work for have worked hard  and continue to work hard for medically vulnerable people to get their shots. 
> 
> There is a vaccination site or vaccine carrying pharmacy in driving or bussing distance of nearly everyone and California has a great program where they will go into your home for free and vaccinate you if you are immobile. 
> 
> Cities like LA have 1.9 new cases daily per 100k people, and have estimated potentially 30% or more of the population with antibodies from previous infection, on top of having 2/3 adults having been vaccinated. 
> 
> Do we seriously need to wear masks for the rest of our lives because some lazy or right wing people won't get their shot? They've already been given a one month warning that the mask mandate was ending. Plus the mRNA vaccines provide the same level or more of protection after a single shot vs. Johnson and Johnson. Texas has not seen an increase in cases since their mandate ended (including in liberal cities like Austin that kept their mandate until recently). COVID is in exponential decay and will soon enter the realm of actually being less lethal than the flu in terms of daily fatalities, and we weren't mandating masks for the flu.  If you want to continue to wear your mask I won't judge you for it, but I don't want to if I don't have to.  Covid is cancelled.

## Kevin McCarthy might have had coronavirus infection when he attended son's wedding

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-22/kevin-mccarthy-son-wedding-covid-19-infection):

> House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy earlier this year said he took "Every precaution" before ignoring state rules and attending a maskless wedding ceremony and reception for his son during a December surge in COVID-19 cases in California. McCarthy told The Times that the 13 family members who attended the Dec. 5 wedding were tested for the virus beforehand and "Were healthy then and have remained healthy. And like the choices families have made all across the country, the choices we made [were] ours." In response to questions from The Times in February, McCarthy said in an emailed statement that the original plan for a 300-guest wedding was scrapped and that the bride and groom decided to go forward with just parents, grandparents and sisters.

> I'm no fan of the man, but this story is bullshit. He tested positive for antibodies which doesn't tell us when he was infected or frankly even if he was infected; antibody tests have a high false positive rate.
