## Coronavirus: Backlog of cases in Los Angeles fuels California spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-huge-backlog-of-cases-in-los-angeles-county-explains-spike-in-california):

> The number of COVID-19 cases in California spiked Thursday, but it was fueled by a significant backlog of tests reported in the nation's largest county. In total, the 6,359 new cases were, far and away, the most reported in California a single day since Aug. 31, but more than half of those came in Los Angeles County, where there was an estimated backlog of 2,000 cases, county health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. The 3,579 total cases reported Thursday in Los Angeles were quadruple the county's previous daily average and its most in a single day since July 29.

## Southwest Will Stop Blocking Middle Seats on Dec. 1 | Travel + Leisure

Summary of [original article](https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/southwest/southwest-airlines-filling-middle-seat-coronavirus?utm_campaign=travelandleisure_travelandleisure&utm_content=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_term=5f91bd2c64fdb20001741699):

> Southwest will stop blocking middle seats aboard its aircraft in December, the airline's CEO said on Thursday. Last month, Southwest had extended its policy to block the middle seat through the end of November. "We haven't decided when next year is the right time to start to sell the middle seat at this point in time, it's going to be based very much on customer sentiment, what we're learning from medical experts about advances and dealing with the virus, and when people are comfortable buying and sitting back in the middle seats - and that's going to take a number of months," Bastian told the network.
