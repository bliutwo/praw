## No COVID-19 cash for rural cities questioning Newsom's rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2020-07-27/gavin-newsom-covid-19-cash-blocked-rural-cities-newsletter-essential-politics):

> On Friday, city leaders in Atwater and Coalinga - communities about 100 miles apart and together smaller than 150 other cities in California - were told federal coronavirus relief funds were being withheld due to local actions the Newsom administration says are in violation of state public health rules. Because California's largest communities received money directly from the feds - a total of $5.8 billion to counties and cities with populations over 500,000 - the state budget provides help for less-populous locations. "The state remains optimistic that these cities will do what is right to protect public health and safety in their communities and will move expeditiously to rescind their resolutions," said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the state emergency services agency.

> I think this is how it ought to be.  Covid bailout money is for people and places that must stay closed.  If you stay open, no money!  Should be this way everywhere.
