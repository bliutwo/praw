## In an alarming new record, daily coronavirus cases surpass 10,500 in L.A. County

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-06/california-braces-for-new-round-of-stay-at-home-orders):

> In a few hours, much of California will be under a new stay-at-home order that requires barbershops and salons to shut down, restaurants to pause in-person dining and people to stop gathering with those who don't live in their households. Orange County tallied a record number of new coronavirus cases in a single day Sunday: 2,025, surpassing the record-setting 1,966 cases the county reported Saturday. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco called the new stay-at-home order "Flat-out ridiculous" and criticized the state for threatening to cut funding to counties that didn't comply with the state's COVID-19 guidelines for reopening.

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/06/three-bay-area-counties-record-most-cases-ever-beat-records-made-in-the-past-week):

> Three Bay Area counties have, in new coronavirus numbers, surpassed records set over the past week, as public health officials continue to deal with a surge in cases nationwide. That contributed to the entire Bay Area recording the most cases ever as well, with 2,691 new cases reported for a total of 164,291 cases across the nine-county area. Contra Costa County, which had recorded the highest number of cases Dec. 1, passed that record as public health officials reported 587 new cases - the most ever - for a total of 26,355 cases.

## Entertainment Industry Workers Exempt From California Governor Gavin Newsom’s New Stay-At-Home Order

> Film crews are tested regularly (my husband gets tested like 3x a week,) and there are people on set every day whose whole job is to monitor covid compliance. Yes occasionally you get a positive, but you only found it because you're doing regular testing. It really hasn't been "outbreaks all the time," by any means. (at least in our experience. I don't know what other industries or non-union shoots are doing.) 
> 
>  Imagine if we had actual regular, mandatory testing even just once a month for anybody that has to work anywhere other than at home. I think we'd be in way better shape. But we can't or won't make the investment. Entertainment does, because they already have a lot invested and covid can take down a whole show real quick. It's also an interesting thing... because most sets you have your rich Hollywood types working alongside the crew and PAs and regular people, so everybody is tested equally and held to the same standard. It's not a situation where the CEOs (generally) are working from home and don't care what happens to the peons. 
> 
> It's not fair. But I get it. What's truly unfair is that good systems exist, but we're not using them across the board. Not even close. And people are getting screwed and they have no control over it.
