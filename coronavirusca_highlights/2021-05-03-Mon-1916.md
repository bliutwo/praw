## California coronavirus case rates keep 'falling like a rock' despite surges in Oregon, Washington

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-03/california-coronavirus-cases-fall-amid-oregon-washington-surges):

> Even as Oregon and Washington face new COVID-19 surges, there is growing optimism that California remains in recovery mode as coronavirus cases continued to fall dramatically along with related deaths. There are now fewer than 2,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases a day on average over the past week in California, a huge drop from about 45,000 cases a day at the peak of the surge in December and January. There hasn't been a troubling surge in California and Arizona, which have observed more cases of the California variant than the U.K. variant.
