## In an alarming new record, daily coronavirus cases surpass 10,500 in L.A. County

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-06/california-braces-for-new-round-of-stay-at-home-orders):

> In a few hours, much of California will be under a new stay-at-home order that requires barbershops and salons to shut down, restaurants to pause in-person dining and people to stop gathering with those who don't live in their households. Orange County tallied a record number of new coronavirus cases in a single day Sunday: 2,025, surpassing the record-setting 1,966 cases the county reported Saturday. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco called the new stay-at-home order "Flat-out ridiculous" and criticized the state for threatening to cut funding to counties that didn't comply with the state's COVID-19 guidelines for reopening.

`/u/BlankVerse` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k84ugx/in_an_alarming_new_record_daily_coronavirus_cases/):

> And California is very close to 20,000 deaths!

> >"Sorry, haven’t had a haircut since March."
> 
> Damn, he can't support the barbershop industry, but he's whining about *his* industry being negatively affected. Or, does he think there's something intrinsically unsafe about getting a haircut with proper decontamination and PPE, so he refuses to do it? Perhaps similar to how I'm not eating out at a restaurant, even outdoors, because it doesn't feel right to me.
> 
> I wish we had a government that could adequately support people enough so they don't have to fight a conflict between making money not to starve and not dying of an infectious illness. It would save a lot of people getting cancelled after posting stupid shit on Twitter about covid.
