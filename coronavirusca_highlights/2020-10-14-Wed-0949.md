## Gov. Newsom Sending a Team to Disney World for Theme Park Reopening Feedback

Summary of [original article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gov-newsom-sending-a-team-to-disney-world-for-theme-park-reopening-feedback):

> California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Monday that he was sending members of his staff to Walt Disney World to see firsthand how the theme park is operating amid the pandemic as the company is demanding Disneyland be allowed to reopen. Disney has pointed to the success of the destination since Disney World reopened in July with no known cases of COVID-19 linked to the park. The governor did not say the team would only be visiting Disney World; they may go to Universal Orlando, too, but Disney has been the most outspoken about allowing its SoCal theme park to reopen.

> A couple of updates to this article: 
> 
> 1. State officials already conducted a visit/tour of Disneyland (CA), back in late Sept/early October. The tour happened prior to the governor’s office issuance of guidelines that the Theme Parks Association quickly rejected before the guidelines could become official. 
> 
> 2. Apparently (unconfirmed), the California health officials who went to Florida to check out WDW have *already done so*, and were likely doing an “undercover secret shop” visit of the parks in Orlando to get a clearer picture of everyday COVID safety protocols from the company, rather than an elaborate presentation.

> I don’t see the issue with just buying kids a big bag of halloween candy and letting them go to town on it this year while watching some halloween movies dressed up in their costumes, it sucks that they can’t trick or treat but we can still make it a fun and memorable halloween with some creative alternatives

## Universal Studios Hollywood Has Laid Off More Than 2200 People

Summary of [original article](https://bleedingcool.com/pop-culture/universal-studios-hollywood-has-laid-off-more-than-2200-people/):

> There has been a lot of debate about what a theme park in a COVID-19 world looks like, and while some parks have opened, both Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood have both had to remain closed. According to Deadline, Universal Studios Hollywood has cut more than 1,300 jobs permanently and temporarily laid off 849 workers since July. So at least Universal isn't cutting health benefits for the people who had health benefits during a pandemic, so that's good, I suppose.

> But at least we are saving lives!!! Not like dang ole Florida

## Pacifica CA Yoga Studio holds mask-free Classes despite State Guidelines

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/health/coronavirus/pacifica-yoga-studio-holds-mask-free-classes-despite-state-guidelines/):

> The owner of Pacifica Beach Yoga is holding yoga classes without face covering requirements. The yoga studio held several hot yoga classes on Monday. Pacifica Beach Yoga in Pacifica posted on social media advertising hot yoga classes on Monday, including hashtags 'mask free,' 'fear-free,' 'virus-free,' 'coward free,' and 'Trump 2020,' among others.

`/u/esseffgirl` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ja774y/pacifica_ca_yoga_studio_holds_maskfree_classes/):

> This yoga studio is in my town.  I remember when the lockdown first started their windows were plastered with anti-Gavin Newsom posters.  Haven't been by since, but was unsurprised to see them featured on KRON4 [as well as on](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/j9qxlb/hot_yoga_studio_not_following_covid_guidelines/) /r/bayarea today.  
> 
> Of all activities, I think hot yoga in a crowded studio would be one of the most risky fitness activity with so much fluids and heavy breathing happening indoors.  I have to hot yoga and it's like being in a petri dish even without a pandemic going on.
