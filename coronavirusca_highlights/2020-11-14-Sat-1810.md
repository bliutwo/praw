> It doesn't help that my job has people taking week long trips to vegas and going to casinos that are close by too. It shouldn't be too much of a problem, but these people are the ones who think covid isn't a big deal and won't even wear their mask properly when at work.  My county is one where the police refuse to enforce mask rules. Management also believed after Nov. 3rd covid would vanish. I feel so helpless at work.

## CA Gov. Newsom May Use “Emergency Brakes” As Coronavirus Worsens

Summary of [original article](https://deadline.com/2020/11/california-gavin-newsom-coronavirus-emergency-brakes-restrictions-1234615553/):

> "To date, we've had counties move back only one tier at a time," he continued before imagining that counties might jump back multiple tiers at once. Earlier in the week Ghaly presided over the announcement that 11 of the state's counties would be sliding back into more restrictive coronavirus tiers. "Many are already there. We're going to work with counties. If additional changes to the Purple tier are required, we're going to work with our local counties to see what's there. We are not looking today at a statewide stay-at-home order. We know Californians are fatigued."

> If L.A. County is an example of “most restrictive,” this whole system is a joke.

## Purple Tier and Schools

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jtz9o3/purple_tier_and_schools/):

> We only shut down if over a 14 day period 5% of the total school population including staff tests positive. No parent is ever required to tell the school their child has tested positive. Things are getting scary and we are relying on people who won't even wear masks to disclose if their kid has tested positive.

`/u/organize_me_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jtz9o3/purple_tier_and_schools/):

> NOT OK! I’m a teacher too. This is why I’m looking for a different job. We should not be open in a purple tier!

## Coronavirus: Indoor dining closures across Bay Area amid spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/13/coronavirus-much-of-bay-area-moves-to-shut-down-indoor-dining-amid-spiking-cases):

> On Friday, with hours left for restaurants in San Francisco to cease indoor operations under an order announced earlier this week, Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Marin counties joined in the ban on indoor dining, in addition other new local restrictions. In addition to the closure of indoor dining in Contra Costa County, fitness centers will be required to shut down indoor operations and concession stands at movie theaters must close. In Oregon, which joined with California and Washington in advising a 14-day quarantine for incoming travelers, Gov. Kate Brown on Friday announced a "Two-week freeze" that would shut down a swath of indoor activities, including dining, across the entire state.

`/u/TropicalKing` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jtssfh/coronavirus_indoor_dining_closures_across_bay/):

> This is kind of "three strikes and your out" for small businesses.  Just like NYC, there will be massive restaurant closures because of these indoor dining closures.
