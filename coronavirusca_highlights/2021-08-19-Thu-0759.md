> The poll is part of Blue Shield's BlueSky initiative, the nonprofit health plan's multi-year effort to support youth mental health including online and on-campus mental health services and supporting educator training on student mental health. Pandemic takes a toll on mental health - and youth are talking about It. Teens surveyed were asked to gauge their mental health at different points in time - before the COVID-19 pandemic, during its height, and since the state reopened on June 15. BIPOC teens were less likely to discuss their mental health with their parents than white teens.

## Colleges rush to sign students up for food stamps, as pandemic rules make more eligible

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/college-beat-higher-education/2021/08/food-stamps-college-students/):

> In response to the law, some California community colleges and universities are stepping up their efforts to help students apply for CalFresh. More than a third of California college students report experiencing food insecurity - meaning they don't have reliable access to healthy food - according to the California Student Aid Commission's 2018-2019 Student Expenses and Resources Survey. "Then we have to ensure students and people who have the ability to communicate with students are aware of the changes and can clearly communicate them. The next step is ensuring that students apply."
