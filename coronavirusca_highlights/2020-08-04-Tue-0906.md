## Riverside County officials say slowdown in coronavirus case growth is misleading

Summary of [original article](https://www.pe.com/2020/08/03/riverside-county-officials-say-slowdown-in-coronavirus-case-growth-is-misleading/):

> A technical problem with California's coronavirus reporting database is giving the false impression that the rise in new Riverside County cases is slowing, county officials said Monday, Aug. 3. Lab data is not being submitted to the CalREDIE database in a timely manner, making it look like the county's case growth in recent days is leveling out, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari said in a news release. Here are the latest numbers, according to county and state public health officials.

## Coronavirus: Hospitalizations show improving situation in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/03/coronavirus-hospitalizations-show-improving-situation-in-california/amp/):

> The per-capita rate in California on Sunday stood at about 21.6 cases per 100,000 residents per day over the past week, lower than 14 other states. California is averaging about as many new cases per day as it was during the second week of July, representing an extended plateau of about 8,500 cases per day. Infectious disease experts said to expect the death curve to trail by three or four weeks, meaning California could be in for many more days of significant death totals, even as new cases level off.

`/u/GuyMumbles` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i32i5p/coronavirus_hospitalizations_show_improving/):

> Finally some good news. I’d imagine it’s the tail end of the 4th of July surge.
