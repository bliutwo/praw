> In California schools, masks will continue to be worn in the classroom, according to the California Department of Public Health. The State department of public health is expected to put out their updated guidance on K-12 schools on Monday July 12. "There's no substitute for in-person instruction, and today's CDC guidance clearly reinforces that as a top priority, issuing recommendations for how schools throughout the country can get there. Here in California, we'll get there through continued masking and robust testing capacity," said Dr. Tomás Aragón, Director of the California Department of Public Health and State Public Health Officer in the release.
