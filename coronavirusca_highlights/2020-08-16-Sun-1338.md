> New York didn't corral shit. I hate this new narrative. They got hit so hard that almost everybody that was bound to die from coronavirus did die.
> 
> NY: 1691 deaths per million
> 
> CA: 284 deaths per million
> 
> CA's peak average daily deaths has been 142. Even if 142 Californians died every day for the next year and no NYers ever died again from COVID, CA would still be doing better than NY in deaths per million (1576 to 1691).

`/u/ItsJustATux` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iaig5i/does_wearing_a_face_shield_count_as_wearing_a_mask/):

> No. Face shields provide additional protection for the wearer when combined with a mask. A face-shield alone does not protect the wearer *or the people around them.* 
> 
> This isn’t a stupid question. I’ve seen a lot of people wearing shields instead of masks. Someone will come post the science eventually, I just wanted to put it in plain English first.

## Saliva-based coronavirus test funded by NBA, NBPA gets emergency authorization from FDA

Summary of [original article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29667299/fda-allowing-saliva-based-test-funded-nba):

> 11:56 AM ET. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorization on Saturday allowing public use of a saliva-based test for the coronavirus developed at Yale University and funded by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association. Yale administered the saliva test to a group that included NBA players and staff in the lead-up to the league's return to play and compared results to the nasal swab tests the same group took. The leading coronavirus saliva test, developed at a Rutgers University lab and given the same permission by the FDA in mid-April, costs individual consumers up to $150 - though that can be reduced to $60 or $70 in some circumstances, said Andrew Brooks, an associate professor at Rutgers and chief operating officer of RUCDR Infinite Biologics, the lab behind the test.

> This is really interesting. To me the raw numbers don’t mean as much because the population numbers are so different. Expressing it as per capita is much more informative.
