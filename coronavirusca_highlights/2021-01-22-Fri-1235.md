Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/It-s-a-secret-California-keeps-key-virus-data-15889509.php?IPID=SFGate-HP-CP-Spotlight):

> State health officials said they rely on a very complex set of measurements that would confuse and potentially mislead the public if they were made public.

The state's public model shows a roughly 30% decline in Southern California ICU patients over the next month even as hospitalizations flatten and deaths climb.
