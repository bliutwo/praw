## Gavin Newsom announces new stay-at-home order that could take effect in some regions this week

Summary of [original article](https://amp.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247546405.html):

> The new order will apply in regions where available intensive care unit capacity drops below 15%, according to the Newsom administration. In regions where intensive care unit capacity falls below the threshold, the new stay-at-home order will bar nonessential gatherings and require people to stay at home as much as possible to avoid transmitting the virus. The new order represents a return for many Californians to the isolation they experienced in March, when California was the first state to impose a stay-at-home order.

> It's like Newsom is trying to do as little as possible while appearing to be doing something. There is lag from infection to hospitalization, from hospitalization to ICU, and from ICU to death. Using ICU capacity to trigger stay-at-home is only one step better than using morgue capacity to trigger stay-at-home. It's almost as bad as saying that we won't do anything until people are dying faster than we can bury them.

## Thirteen percent of California farmworkers tested positive for Covid-19 compared with 3 percent of Californians overall, said a recent study.

Summary of [original article](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2020/12/02/salinas-valley-farmworkers-study-finds-13-positive-covid-19/3786093001/):

> The report included COVID-19 testing of 1,091 agricultural workers in the Salinas Valley. Eskenazi pointed to other data points from the study - about half of participating farmworkers have struggled to pay their bills during the pandemic, and more than half reported low or very low food security - as she highlighted the need for financial support and other supportive services for workers exposed to or diagnosed with the virus. About half of participating farmworkers said they were extremely likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the UC Berkeley report, while about 20% said they were unsure and 11% said they were either unlikely or very unlikely to do so.1 in 5 participants had COVID-19 antibodiesAs part of the study, UC Berkeley researchers and medical professionals from the Salinas health center interviewed people who worked in agriculture, were age 18 or older, spoke English or Spanish, were not pregnant, were getting tested for COVID-19, and had not tested positive for the virus in the previous two weeks.

> I’m getting kind of annoyed that the surprise stay at home order hasn’t been announced yet. Either say it or don’t, don’t leave everyone in limbo wondering for a week.

## Newsom to order new limits on California businesses and activities as COVID-19 soars

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-03/newsom-weighs-shutdown-california-covid-19-cases-soar-december):

> Although current state projections show only Southern California and Central Valley counties will have to immediately put in place the new rules, data released by the Newsom administration earlier this week show almost all of the state could soon reach the new threshold - with 85% or more of ICU beds filled. Any reopening of closed services and activities will be based on four-week projections of a region's ICU capacity - suggesting the broad new restrictions could easily last through the end of the year in some communities. The new restrictions appear to remove the distinction between essential and nonessential retail - a 20% cap on capacity at all stores is likely to significantly reduce capacity at essential retailers, including supermarkets and drug stores.
