## Los Angeles Covid Surge Being Driven By White, Affluent Neighborhoods

Summary of [original article](https://deadline.com/2021/07/los-angeles-covid-surge-driven-by-white-affluent-neighborhoods-1234802675/amp/?__twitter_impression=true):

> Covid cases continued to rise in Los Angeles County on Thursday, albeit more slowly. That's roughly half of the 7,458 cases recorded in California on Thursday, even though Los Angeles County's population accounts for only roughly 25% of the state's residents. According to Ferrer, the increase in more affluent areas of the city is being driven by a younger, less-vaccinated population.

> These are the neighborhoods which were less impacted during the huge Winter surge. It would seem like those communities would lack a lot of natural immunity, and perhaps in OC, some vaccine hesitancy.

## COVID vaccinations lag for people on Medi-Cal — In all California counties, Medi-Cal enrollees have been vaccinated at substantially lower rates than the overall population. Experts point to several factors for this economic divide, like the inability of low-income people to take time off work.

## CDC warns in internal document that 'war has changed' with the coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/cdc-warns-internal-document-war-has-changed-coronavirus-n1275478):

> Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, said that the CDC document highlighted reasons for concern but did not indicate that vaccinated people are at greater risk. The document notes that the risk of infection is threefold lower in vaccinated people, and the risk of severe disease or death is at least tenfold lower in vaccinated people. PCR results, the CDC wrote, "Might reflect the level of infectious virus." In other words, it could suggest that vaccinated people are as contagious as unvaccinated people.

> Worth noting that this was always somewhat expected, and that vaccines are still working well, if less well, against all known variants. Make sure you get vaccinated and encourage your friends and family to do the same.

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/health/northern-calif-covid-19-outbreak-linked-to-concert-grateful-dead-cover-band/):

> Grateful Shred, a band known for covering Grateful Dead songs, is urging people to get tested and vaccinated after their concert in Northern California resulted in a COVID-19 outbreak. On July 17 and 18, the band Grateful Shred - known for covering Grateful Dead songs - held concerts at Felton Music Hall and the Roaring Camp venue in Santa Cruz County, calling it their "Most successful Shred tour to date." "As many of you have already heard, a number of people have tested positive for Covid who attended our California shows this past weekend. Nearly all of the band and crew have also tested positive and are at home recovering with their families," the statement read. "If you were at any of these events, please get a test and if you're feeling sick, stay home, Apparently the vaccine does not prevent transmission. But fortunately, it does seem to really help with reducing sickness and preventing hospitalization," the band continued.

## Over 25% of new COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County are fully vaccinated people

Summary of [original article](https://www.foxla.com/news/over-25-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-los-angeles-county-are-fully-vaccinated-people):

> "Over the period of July 1 through July 16... There were 13,598 cases diagnosed in LA County and unvaccinated people represented 74% of all of the cases, fully vaccinated people represented 26% or 3,592 of the cases," Ferrer stated. In June fully vaccinated people accounted for 20% of all the cases diagnosed in LA County, while unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people accounted for 80% of the cases. Given the number of people who are vaccinated in the county, she remains hopeful the county won't see a repeat of the winter surge in cases, which led to more than 8,000 people being hospitalized.
