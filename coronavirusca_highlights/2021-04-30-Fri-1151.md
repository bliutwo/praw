## Suddenly, L.A. County has more vaccine than people who want it. Why experts are alarmed

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-30/suddenly-l-a-county-has-more-vaccine-than-people-willing-to-take-it-heres-why-this-alarms-officials):

> The reason: Appointments for the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine have decreased by about 50%. When the vaccine first became available, people clamored to get it, sometime cutting lines and going to other counties. "I do know that across the county this past week we saw much fewer people coming in to get vaccinated. For the first time ever, we've had appointments at many vaccination sites that have not been filled," said L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer during a news briefing Thursday. The decline in demand has prompted the county to shift to more walk-in vaccination sites, rather than requiring appointments, at least through next week and likely beyond.

> People who wanted it really wanted it.  Everyone else DGAF.  Time to hit the streets with mobile vaccines and a free ice cream

## Remember to check myturn.ca.gov for availability *even if you have notifications turned on*

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n1875v/remember_to_check_myturncagov_for_availability/):

> I was able to get a vaccine appointment through Safeway, despite not receiving an email update even though I had availability notifications turned on. I'm not sure if the notifications are only specific to official CA vaccination sites, but I was under the impression they were for availability *anywhere* in the state.

`/u/Maveric0623` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n1875v/remember_to_check_myturncagov_for_availability/):

> Just book directly through CVS. There is vast availability now.

## My Turn Ca Gov Update

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n0x7jq/my_turn_ca_gov_update/):

> The screening of my turn ca gov has updated to include rides or have someone to come to your house if you're not mobile enough to leave the house. Glad they are trying their best to reach people who may have trouble going to vaccine sites.

`/u/MyManManderly` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n0x7jq/my_turn_ca_gov_update/):

> It also now asks which vaccine you've been given, then filters accordingly for those trying to book an appointment for the second dose.

## California has recorded about 1,400 'breakthrough' coronavirus cases in fully vaccinated people

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-has-recorded-about-1-400-16132924.php):

> This year, California has recorded 1,379 cases of coronavirus infection in people who were fully vaccinated, the state Department of Public Health said Tuesday.

Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in mid-April that it had recorded about 5,800 breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated people.

## California and L.A. County will allow fully vaccinated people to go mask-free outdoors, following CDC guidance

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/california-plans-to-follow-federal-guidelines-and-soon-allow-those-fully-vaccinated-to-go-mask-free-outdoors/):

> California health officials announced Tuesday that the state plans to follow new federal guidelines and allow fully vaccinated individuals to no longer wear masks outdoors. Los Angeles County will also update its own guidelines to align with new state and federal rules allowing vaccinated residents to go mask-free in most outdoor settings. Walensky said extra precautions should be taken in these situations since there could be many unvaccinated people present, and it's more difficult for people to stay six feet apart.
