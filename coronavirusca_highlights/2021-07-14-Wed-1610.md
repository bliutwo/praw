Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/covid-breakthrough-cases-case-delta-variant-vaccinated/10885528/):

> As of Monday, there were 3,200 new COVID-19 cases in California, and now, medical doctors are noticing some of the first numbers of COVID vaccine breakthrough cases. "The majority of the new cases that we are seeing right now in the United States are occurring unfortunately on unvaccinated people. 99% of the COVID related deaths are among unvaccinated people. That to me feels heartbreaking because those are preventable deaths," said Dr. Annie Luetkemeyer, Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at UCSF. UCSF' Dr. Luetkemeyer emphasizing those breakthrough cases could've been worse without the vaccine triggering a strong immune response. Dr. Peluso said they began noticing the small number of breakthrough cases after June right as the Delta variant intensified.

## San Francisco is seeing an increase in COVID cases. What's going on?

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/San-Francisco-just-saw-a-sudden-increase-in-COVID-16312743.php):

> San Francisco health officials noted that the 153 number likely includes backdated cases. The San Francisco Public Health Department provided the following statement on Tuesday: "The case increases we are experiencing are a combination of the expected increases due to the reopening of the economy and the presence of the highly transmissive Delta variant. As we experience increases in cases, we are doing everything possible to get more of our eligible population vaccinated, our best tool to keep cases stable and protect people from COVID-19, and its variants." The last time San Francisco added more than 100 new cases to its total in one day was Feb. 26 with 131 cases, according to Chronicle data.

`/u/fertthrowaway` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ojuhx8/san_francisco_is_seeing_an_increase_in_covid/):

> Well everything went back to "normal" while we knew Delta was here. Not enough % of the population are vaccinated to have herd immunity against Delta, not in SF or anywhere. What other outcome could possibly happen?
