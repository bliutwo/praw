> Excerpt: 
> 
> > The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U.S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world.
> 
> > And vaccines available in the U.S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.
> 
> > “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”
> 
> > Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that walloped the nation three times in the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t been previously been infected with the coronavirus.
> 
> > This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated.
> 
> > Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”

## Vaccination rates wane in California. Did the state do enough to target those in doubt?

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-27/california-vaccination-rates-wane-amid-debate-over-strategy):

> State officials are trying to change the mind of both "Undecideds" and "Rejecters," and are relying primarily on vaccine lotteries with giveaways totaling $116.5 million or vacation packages, and on glitzy advertising campaigns featuring paid social media influencers. County public health officials say the campaign isn't big enough to combat vaccine falsehoods that have infiltrated regions such as California's rural north. California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly acknowledged that the state must boost its presence on the ground and said it "Needs to do better and more." At the same time, he and other state officials argue that the vaccine lottery is working and that they are seeing progress in hard-hit neighborhoods.

> People in my department (state) are on a task force to call unvaccinated people to ask them if they can do something to help them get vaccinated, or send them materials to help them understand why the vaccines are safe and a good idea.  Every state agency contributes dozens of employees to this task force.  They call each person 4 times.  This is a massive undertaking, involving 
>  tens of thousands of man hours a week.  I don't know what else the state can do, beyond offering prizes for getting the vaccine, making travel to and from free, and calling people to offer assistance and encouragement to sign up.  
> 
> Increasingly, the people  who aren't vaccinated, really don't want to be.  We're going to have to deal with that fact.  It's not just that the state DIDN'T do enough.

## Gottlieb says parts of U.S. could see "very dense outbreaks" as Delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gottlieb-covid-19-delta-variant-face-the-nation/):

> Washington - As the U.S. continues to navigate its way through the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said areas of the country could experience "Very dense outbreaks" with the concerning Delta variant continuing to circulate. Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a state where hospital admissions are up 30%, expressed concern about the Delta COVID-19 variant and low vaccination rates in his state. "The Delta variant is a great concern to us. We see that impacting our increasing cases and hospitalizations," Hutchinson said on "Face the Nation." The governor also noted that vaccine hesitancy is high in his state, which he attributed to conspiracy theories, the pause in Johnson & Johnson's one-shot regimen in April and individuals simply not believing in the efficacy of the virus.
