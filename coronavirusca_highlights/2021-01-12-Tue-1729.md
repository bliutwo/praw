## Children apologize to their dying elders for spreading COVID-19 as L.A. County reels

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-12/children-apologizing-to-parents-grandparents-spreading-coronavirus-into-families-as-l-a-county-reels):

> "One of the more heartbreaking conversations that our healthcare workers share is about these last words when children apologize to their parents and grandparents for bringing COVID into their homes for getting them sick. And these apologies are just some of the last words that loved ones will ever hear as they die alone," Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said. Officials believe the current spike was driven in part by family gatherings around Thanksgiving and Christmas that allowed younger people, who were more likely to be out and about, to spread COVID-19 to their elders, who otherwise tended to stay home. At least 10% to 12% of people infected with the virus are hospitalized, and more than 1% of people diagnosed with the virus end up dying, Ferrer said.
