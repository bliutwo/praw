Trends however appear "encouraging", and show the number of people hospitalized over the last two weeks for COVID has declined by 20% and ICU admissions have declined 14%

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/california-first-state-surpass-600000-coronavirus-cases/?):

> California has become the first state in the U.S. to surpass 600,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Johns Hopkins University reported 603,072 coronavirus cases in the Golden State on Friday morning. Despite being the first state to issue a stay-at-home order in March, California has become one of the hotspots of the virus in the U.S. since it started to reopen in May. In response, Newsom issued a statewide mask mandate in mid-June and once again shut down bars and indoor dining.

> It seems so inefficient that Newsom has been quietly stockpiling masks for schools which won't even start the school year in-person. He complains all the time about states having to compete with other states and the federal government on PPE but doesn't realize that he is creating the same problem within his state. Demand is doubled for no good reason if adults are supplied by their jobs but they don't know when they can go back to work, and children are supplied by their schools but they don't know when they can go back to school. Understandably, people are creating their own stockpile at home.
> 
> For schools, at least, the government should make it so that schools supply masks to children, whether or not schools are open.
