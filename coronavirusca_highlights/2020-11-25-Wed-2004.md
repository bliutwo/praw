## Coronavirus: California sees record case spike, more counties restricted. Are we behaving ‘selfishly’?

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/24/coronavirus-california-sees-record-case-spike-more-counties-restricted-are-we-behaving-selfishly/):

> California moved more counties to tighter restrictions on business and activities Tuesday after the state set new records of daily infections amid a relentless autumn surge that has left health officials pleading with people to avoid Thanksgiving gatherings outside their households this week. Seven counties moved to higher-tier restrictions Tuesday in the state's four-color reopening scheme: Colusa, Humboldt, Del Norte and Lassen bumped up to the highest purple tier for widespread infections, Calaveras to the red tier for substantial cases, and Alpine and Mariposa to the orange tier for moderate spread. No counties remain in the yellow tier for minimal transmission. At the time, only a dozen California counties remained under the purple restrictions for widespread outbreaks - in Los Angeles, as well as counties with significant agriculture in the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Central Coast, including Sonoma and Monterey.

## California official: just say 'no' to family Thanksgiving

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/los-angeles-discuss-stay-home-order-covid-cases-74371997):

> Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, who said she had heard a "Cacophony" of opposition from restaurant owners, said that closing restaurants was a difficult but necessary move. Restaurants went to court Tuesday to halt the restaurant closure from taking effect, but a Los Angeles judge rejected their case. The California Restaurant Association had argued that Los Angeles County health officials should have to provide medical or scientific evidence that outdoor restaurant dining poses an unreasonable risk to public health.

> I guess California haven't learned that it will not work. We are one day away from Thanksgiving, those that decided to go will be going.

> ## I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms
> 
> If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you had a positive viral test for COVID-19. Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.
> 
> *If you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for “I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms.”*
