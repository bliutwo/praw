## Infectious Delta variant spreads rapidly, now California’s dominant coronavirus strain

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-04/delta-variant-spreads-rapidly-now-california-most-dominant-strain-coronavirus-covid-19):

> New data released by the California Department of Public Health now say that 35.6% of coronavirus variants so far analyzed in June have been identified as the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. That's a dramatic relative increase from May, when the Delta variant comprised just 5.6% of analyzed coronavirus cases in California, and Delta was the state's fourth most identified variant. "The rapid increase in the Delta variant suggests that this strain is more easily transmitted between people than other strains circulating in California," the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.

> Delta is no. Walk in the park even if you been vaccinated, follow the rules so you don’t catch it
