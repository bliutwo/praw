> 
> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

## $600 California stimulus for families that made under $30,000. Estimated 4 million families are eligible, appears to be tied to EITC.

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/01/06/governor-newsom-announces-golden-state-stimulus-a-budget-proposal-to-help-low-income-californians-through-600-rapid-cash-payments-and-calls-for-extension-of-eviction-moratorium/):

> Golden State Stimulus $600 rapid cash support will go to recipients of the state's Earned Income Tax Credit in 2019, as well as those filing with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers this year who meet the eligibility criteria. SACRAMENTO - As millions of Californians struggle to make ends meet as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Gavin Newsom today announced two immediate action items in his 2021-22 State Budget proposal to help low-income Californians. "The Golden State stimulus is needed now more than ever. Millions of working families are on the ropes, barely hanging on during this pandemic-induced recession. This additional $600 in rapid cash relief will put food on the table for millions of vulnerable Californians, help pay rent and these funds will be a shot in the arm for our economy. The EITC has been a priority for the Senate for many years now and we look forward to partnering with the Governor to get these dollars into the pockets of struggling families as quickly as possible," said Senator Mike McGuire.

> Tying it to the EITC is idiotic. It’s not going to get to people who need it.

## Arizona surpasses California as state with the worst coronavirus infection rate

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-22/arizona-coronavirus-surge):

> This state of 7.2 million now has the worst coronavirus infection rate in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LaBaer, whose center runs test sites across the state, estimated that "Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 people in Arizona currently have an active case of the virus." Last month, the chief medical officers of eight of the state's largest hospitals wrote a letter to Gov. Doug Ducey and Arizona Department of Health Services Director Cara Christ asking for curfews and an end to indoor dining and group sports.

## Rate of new coronavirus infections falling across California, but death rates remain high

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/california/rate-of-new-coronavirus-infections-falling-across-california-but-death-rates-remain-high/):

> The rates of new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations are dropping across California, but health officials warn those trends are tempered by very high death rates. In the last week the state averaged about 29,000 new cases per day, more than 6,000 fewer than the prior week. In Los Angeles County, the state's most populous, the test positivity rate has plummeted 39% over the past three weeks, health officials said.

`/u/unlimitedpower6` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/l3rt4m/rate_of_new_coronavirus_infections_falling_across/):

> Just wondering: could falling rates be a reflection of reduced testing? I know in LA specifically some sites that used Curative were shut down a couple weeks ago, which lines up with the timing of the downward trend.

> 
> Get this. We arrive 30 mins early and there is no line at all! The guy checking us in tells us that many people aren't showing up, presumably because of the rain.
> 
> How fucking stupid are people that a little rain will keep them from being vaccinated, when the appointment was a major pain in the ass to get?
