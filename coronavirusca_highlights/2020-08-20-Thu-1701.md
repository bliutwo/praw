> 
> edit 1: I've contacted the San Joaquin County Health Dept and am filing a complaint.  It's supposed to be anonymous.
> 
> edit 2: the Health Dept called me back and took the complaint.  I emailed them this pic, and they say they'll follow up with SJC Sheriffs.  Doubt I'll hear anything back but I believe I have done my civic duty to slow the spread.

## Orange County caterer has zero COVID precautions in pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/id1oe7/orange_county_caterer_has_zero_covid_precautions/):

> 24 Carrots Catering in Orange County are still putting on regular weddings, no social distancing, no masks, no guest count limits. People need to know how irresponsible this company is being in a pandemic. If the mayor of LA is willing to shut off power for parties, Orange County needs to do something similar to stop these parties from happening.

> I agree. One of the hotels in Laguna Beach ( located in OC) had a wedding of 60 guests. I'm suprised that this is actually happening in the middle of a global pandemic. This pandemic has bought out the stupidity out of people. 
> 
> I would report them to the heath department or shoot an email to the governor's office. 
> 
> There needs to be some serious fines and enforcement for companies that do this.

> Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday that he had authorized the city to disconnect utility service at a Hollywood Hills house after it hosted several large parties in "Flagrant violation" of COVID-19 public health orders. The announcement comes two weeks after Garcetti first warned that properties hosting "Un-permitted large gatherings" could have their water and power service shut off as a consequence. According to the mayor's office, the Hollywood Hills house hosted a large gathering on Aug. 8, three days after the threat of utility shutoffs was first announced.

> Self isolate doesn’t stop with him. The rest of the household needs to keep a distance from him but also self isolate due to possible exposure. Basically quarantine as a family. Protect yourself from him and protect the rest from you. Everyone stay put until he gets results back.
