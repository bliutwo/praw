## Sheriff's deputies not wearing masks as required, L.A. County inspector general says

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-25/sheriffs-deputies-not-wearing-masks-as-required-l-a-county-inspector-general-says):

> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies are failing to follow public health orders that require them to wear masks on the job, giving the impression they are above the law, the Office of Inspector General warned. "In some instances, members of the department had masks but were not wearing them with the nose and mouth covered as required." "We were approached by an individual who requested to book a private event to honor a group of first responders. It was not a booking by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department directly, and we cannot confirm whether LASD staff were present," the company said in its statement.

> The plan looks to move students into the dorms and collect that money before shutting down. It’s fucked. These students that catch Covid will be bringing it back to the places they’re from.

## What are people doing about child care?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ih2lby/what_are_people_doing_about_child_care/):

> Biggest issue I'm having is the issue with safety for my child and placing him back in care so I can work regular hours. I'm very concerned about the high daily rates of infection and don't know what to do.

`/u/thedrew` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ih2lby/what_are_people_doing_about_child_care/):

> My wife and I are both working from home while our children attend school from home. We both occasionally go into our offices on opposing schedules to keep one parent at home with the kids.
> 
> We are very fortunate to be in fields that facilitate (or at least tolerate) remote work, and we're lucky to have enough electronic devices to have us all working online simultaneously. I'd argue we're in the best possible scenario and it's still a mess.

## County Gives Schools OK to Reopen for In-Person Instruction Next Tuesday - San Diego County

Summary of [original article](https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/08/25/county-gives-schools-ok-to-reopen-for-in-person-instruction-next-tuesday/):

> Public health officials said Tuesday that all schools in San Diego County will be allowed to reopen for in-person instruction next week. "There's a lot of anticipation for Sept. 1, when San Diego County schools will be allowed to reopen for in-person learning if the county stays off the state's watch list. But it's important to note that even if schools are allowed to reopen for in-person instruction next week, that doesn't mean they all will." With the OK for all schools to reopen if they choose, the county has suspended the waiver program.

> Super smart, kids never get sick and are extra careful about not spreading their germs. I am so proud of the adults that decided to put their children and their neighbors health at risk to save the poor economy. I don't know what we would do if the adults in charge actually had a plan, thank God they don't and figure we are worth the risk. Proud to be an American where at least I know I am free and God bless the kids that died, they did it for the economy!

## Whatever happened to California enacting its own $600/week benefits?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/igoryd/whatever_happened_to_california_enacting_its_own/):

> Back in late July it was reported that with the $600/week in federal unemployment benefits expiring, some members of the state Senate & Assembly were looking at finding a way to extend these benefits through a California-specific plan, if more federal assistance did not come through. While I do see that California has signed on to Trump's offer of an extra $300 week for a period of 3 weeks, this is not only woefully inadequate in itself, but you first have to qualify for at least $100 in state benefits. California is the 4th or 5th largest economy in the world, we can definitely afford something like this and we're in an economic crisis with no end in sight.

> States out of money
