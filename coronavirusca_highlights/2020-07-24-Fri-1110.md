> The three restaurants are Sergio's, Old Town Cafe, and Friar Tucks. My first thought is wondering what other public health rules they feel free to ignore. Like food safety rules; do they bother keeping things at appropriate temperatures?

> While this may be true for some or most states, in CA we are very well poised in regards to PPE with millions of procedural and N95 masks stockpiled along with face shields, gowns, and other PPE. In fact, we have enough inventory to supply our critical infrastructure sectors and schools for 2 months!

> Theres still a long way to go in the fight but generalizations like this can be dangerous and misleading.

## Thousands Flock to Sundial Bridge in Redding to Worship During a Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://anewscafe.com/2020/07/23/redding/bethel-beneath-the-bridge-thousands-flock-to-sundial-bridge-to-worship-during-pandemic/):

> Strangely last night in Redding the pandemic didn't interfere with a Bethel Church-related event that drew thousands of people from not just the North State, but from far outside Shasta County's borders. A security guard who stood watch at the Sundial Bridge entrance estimated that about 5,000 people had crossed the bridge Wednesday night for the outdoor Bethel Church-affiliated service that began at 7:30 p.m. sharp and lasted until about 9 p.m. "That's my best guess," the security guard said with a shrug when asked to surmise how many people were there that night. Mike Mangas of KRCR TV reported on his Facebook page Wednesday night that Bethel Church leadership said the huge gathering of Bethel Church members under the Sundial Bridge in Redding was not a sanctioned church event.

## California to obtain more masks, gear as it becomes state with most COVID-19 cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-22/coronavirus-cases-rise-newsom-ppe-masks-gear):

> On a day when California became the state with the most coronavirus infections in the U.S., Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that officials are redoubling efforts to secure protective gear and are preparing to expand the number of available hospital beds to handle a surge in patients. With more than 409,000 cumulative COVID-19 cases in the state, California on Wednesday exceeded the number reported in New York by about 700 cases, according to data provided by Johns Hopkins University. At a news conference held in a Sacramento warehouse housing personal protective equipment, Newsom said he is extending a contract with Chinese firm BYD to buy 300 million more surgical masks and 120 million additional N95 face masks to protect medical workers and others, while he also seeks bids from companies that can provide protective gear in future months.
