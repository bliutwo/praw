## O.C. Board of Education will sue Newsom to reopen schools

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/oc-board-of-education-plans-suit-against-newsom-to-reopen-schools?_amp=true):

> The Orange County Board of Education doubled down on its battle with California Gov. Gavin Newsom's coronavirus school closure orders, voting to sue the governor in an effort to open campuses across high-risk counties. The decision to sue during a closed session vote Tuesday night comes after the board approved recommendations on July 13 calling for Orange County schools to teach students in person and suggested guidelines against students wearing masks and social distancing. Board President Ken Williams and Vice President Mari Barke cited community discussion, data review and consultation with experts to justify their votes, apparently referencing the controversial white paper the board published to recommend schools reopen in person, which was attached to the bottom of the release.

## California cuts off coronavirus aid to two cities that refuse to shut down — leaders in Atwater, a city of 29,000 in Merced County, and Coalinga, a city of 17,000 in of Fresno County, stood by resolutions allowing all businesses in their communities to reopen.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-cuts-off-coronavirus-aid-to-two-cities-15444088.php):

> Two small cities in the San Joaquin Valley that rejected public health orders to shut down certain businesses during the coronavirus pandemic remain defiant after the state took steps to withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid. Atwater Mayor Paul Creighton, who led an effort in May to declare it a "Sanctuary city for all businesses," said he worried that shutting down again would cost more in lost tax revenue and failed businesses than whatever financial aid the state is offering. The recently passed state budget included $1.8 billion in federally supplied coronavirus relief for cities and counties.

## What More Can California Do to Stop the Coronavirus?

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/coronavirus-california-health-equity.html?fbclid=IwAR30v1L3YoBM4Tdraxl9xeUD8f45KOFELmn-0wHtVLyaxZ73z_mo-H4jA2I):

> A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was "Very rare," but she later walked back that statement... I think we should be communicating to people so they can start to make decisions themselves, as opposed to just closing big sectors of life - that's the mind-set we have to be in rather than, "All bars and dining are bad," or "I can't get together with anyone." Do you think some of these essential sectors have the potential to get it right - to be models for how to keep people safe inside?

> Enforce the guidelines that already exist. 
> 
> Hand out warnings and masks to people not wearing masks. Next time they get a ticket. Remind people to cover their noses. We can enforce parking laws but not mask laws?
> 
> Hire more tracers and trace faster. 
> 
> Take away licenses for businesses that break quarantine laws.
