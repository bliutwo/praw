## COVID patients have doubled in California hospitals

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/uncategorized/2021/08/covid-hospitals-california/):

> Hospitals in all California counties are experiencing worrisome surges. The county on Monday reported its first two deaths attributed to the virus since May, both patients in their 70s. The vast majority of hospitalized patients are unvaccinated, said Dr. Gail Newel, the county's health officer. In Yuba County - which takes patients from smaller, neighboring counties that don't have their own hospitals - the hospitalization rate was 46.1 per 100,000 people as of Sunday.

> Only doubled?  I've been privy to the populations at two local hospitals over the whole pandemic, and they were down in the low teens/under 10 in early June, and are now in the 50s at both (Northern Valley).  I guess I'm relieved to hear it's not as bad elsewhere in the state.  Gives me hope there's still room to transfer people as needed (which both those places have been doing, but I assumed other hospitals have been filling up too).

## COVID-19 hospitalizations rise sharply across Southern California as surge continues

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-09/covid-19-hospitalizations-rise-sharply-across-southern-california-as-surge-continues):

> In L.A. County, hospitalizations have doubled in the last 15 days, from 745 on July 24 to 1,503 on Sunday, also the region's worst number since the waning days of the devastating fall and winter surge. The most populated Southern California counties have more than doubled or tripled that threshold, with Ventura County reporting 12 hospitalizations for every 100,000 residents; Orange County, 14; Los Angeles and San Diego counties, 15; Riverside County, 18; and San Bernardino County, 19. L.A. County was the first county in Southern California this summer to have a mandatory mask order for indoor public areas, regardless of vaccination status; Santa Barbara County issued a similar order last week.

## Delta variant is sucking the joy out of back-to-school 2021

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-09/delta-variant-is-sucking-the-joy-out-of-back-to-school-2021):

> Back-to-school 2021, with California campuses fully open for 6 million children, was supposed to herald relief - even celebration - for a mostly normal school year ahead. But a surge in the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has reignited parents' anxiety - and, for many, the safety and quality of schooling once again feel uncertain and tenuous. Otherwise, children in the nation's second-largest school system will be expected to show up on campus for the first day of school Aug. 16. "I feel like the LAUSD is kicking me out of my neighborhood school and its community to some division of home schooling that isn't fully ready or prepared to teach thousands of students with varying needs," said Teresa Gaines, a parent leader with the advocacy group Reclaim Our Schools L.A. Similar parent concerns are echoing across other school systems as parents gird for the possibility of a worsening Delta variant surge.
