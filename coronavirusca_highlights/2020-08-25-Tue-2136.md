## Sheriff's deputies not wearing masks as required, L.A. County inspector general says

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-25/sheriffs-deputies-not-wearing-masks-as-required-l-a-county-inspector-general-says):

> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies are failing to follow public health orders that require them to wear masks on the job, giving the impression they are above the law, the Office of Inspector General warned. "In some instances, members of the department had masks but were not wearing them with the nose and mouth covered as required." "We were approached by an individual who requested to book a private event to honor a group of first responders. It was not a booking by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department directly, and we cannot confirm whether LASD staff were present," the company said in its statement.

> 
> > Huntsman said he reported the issue Friday to the board and a watchdog agency that oversees the Sheriff’s Department. Both statewide and county orders mandate the use of face coverings, and the Sheriff’s Department issued its own order mandating face coverings on April 15 — well ahead of state and county rules.

## SF police record ‘alarming’ spike in COVID-19 cases among officers

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-police-record-alarming-spike-in-covid-19-cases-among-officers/):

> San Francisco police have recorded an "Alarming" spike in officers testing positive for the coronavirus as cases more than doubled in the last week alone after a possible outbreak at the Police Academy. Thirty officers have tested positive for COVID-19 since last Monday, in a sharp jump from the prior five months when 22 officers were confirmed to have the illness, according to new numbers from the San Francisco Police Department. "We are concerned by the uptick in positive COVID cases and appreciate the department working to ensure officers are equipped with the appropriate PPE and sanitation supplies," Montoya said.

> Well, I can’t speak for SFPD. But I can for the LAPD. A lot of those fuckers don’t wear masks.

## County Gives Schools OK to Reopen for In-Person Instruction Next Tuesday - San Diego County

Summary of [original article](https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/08/25/county-gives-schools-ok-to-reopen-for-in-person-instruction-next-tuesday/):

> Public health officials said Tuesday that all schools in San Diego County will be allowed to reopen for in-person instruction next week. "There's a lot of anticipation for Sept. 1, when San Diego County schools will be allowed to reopen for in-person learning if the county stays off the state's watch list. But it's important to note that even if schools are allowed to reopen for in-person instruction next week, that doesn't mean they all will." With the OK for all schools to reopen if they choose, the county has suspended the waiver program.

> Super smart, kids never get sick and are extra careful about not spreading their germs. I am so proud of the adults that decided to put their children and their neighbors health at risk to save the poor economy. I don't know what we would do if the adults in charge actually had a plan, thank God they don't and figure we are worth the risk. Proud to be an American where at least I know I am free and God bless the kids that died, they did it for the economy!

## Whatever happened to California enacting its own $600/week benefits?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/igoryd/whatever_happened_to_california_enacting_its_own/):

> Back in late July it was reported that with the $600/week in federal unemployment benefits expiring, some members of the state Senate & Assembly were looking at finding a way to extend these benefits through a California-specific plan, if more federal assistance did not come through. While I do see that California has signed on to Trump's offer of an extra $300 week for a period of 3 weeks, this is not only woefully inadequate in itself, but you first have to qualify for at least $100 in state benefits. California is the 4th or 5th largest economy in the world, we can definitely afford something like this and we're in an economic crisis with no end in sight.

> 
> Bet in a few weeks, O.C. will probably get put back on the watch list.
