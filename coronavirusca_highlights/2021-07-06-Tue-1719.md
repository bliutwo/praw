## Should you wear a mask if you're fully vaccinated? Some experts say yes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/should-fully-vaccinated-people-continue-wear-masks-experts-weigh-n1272890):

> Despite a slowdown in the rate of vaccinations and the recent uptick in Covid-19 cases in the U.S., there is no indication the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will once again recommend masks for fully vaccinated individuals for the country as a whole. "If you're vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection from all of the variants that we are aware of circulating in the United States," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told NBC News.When would masks be needed?In areas with low vaccine uptake, a return to masks indoors, even for vaccinated people, may be appropriate, Walensky said. That's why Dr. Andy Dunn, a family physician and chief of staff at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper, wants vaccinated people to continue with masking.

## As Delta variant turns into dominant strain in California, scientists detect 'Delta plus'

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/delta-variant-symptoms-of-virus-california-bay-area/10863428/):

> Nevan Krogan, PhD: "The Delta variant has 18 different mutations and 7 of them are in the spike protein. The Delta plus variant has an additional mutation in spike, where some people are saying is resulting in increased transmissibility." Last week Dr. Krogan met with nearly 50 scientists in New York City to understand how the Delta variant is mutating and morphing into new strains like the Delta plus. The Delta variant was first detected in India then mutated into the Delta Plus and now it's in the US. "The Delta plus variant has been detected in Utah," said Dr. Gandhi.
