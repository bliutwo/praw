## Underlying conditions common among kids and teens who die of Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/underlying-conditions-common-among-kids-teens-who-die-covid-19-n1240139):

> Black and Hispanic children and adolescents, along with those with underlying medical conditions, make up the majority of Covid-19 deaths in patients younger than 21, according to a report published Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Deaths among children younger than 10 were less common: There were 24 deaths in children ages 1 to 9, and 12 deaths in infants, the report said. Young people with at least one underlying condition were more likely to die, and nearly half of the deaths were in those with two or more underlying health conditions.

> NBC breaks down the CDC’s new report, which investigates underlying conditions in children and teens who died from COVID. The report found that the most common underlying conditions were asthma and obesity, and that the majority of deaths occurred in those aged 10-20, especially between 18-20. Deaths were also disproportionately distributed by race: Hispanic, Black, and Native American patients accounted for 75% of deaths in the study, even though they only make up 41% of the population.
