## New CDC advice: Most vaccinated Californians should wear masks indoors | Under the CDC‚Äôs new mask recommendations, vaccinated people in 45 California counties ‚Äî all of its most populous areas ‚Äî are advised to wear masks in public indoor places.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/california-covid-mask-guidelines/):

> Nearly all vaccinated Californians should return to wearing masks indoors under new federal guidelines issued today for areas where COVID-19 is surging. The CDC also recommended today that vaccinated people in all areas of the country wear masks indoors if they are immunocompromised or have a higher risk of severe disease if infected, or if they live with someone who is. Under the state's current mask guidelines, vaccinated people do not have to wear masks indoors except on public transit and in settings including hospitals, schools, prisons, nursing homes and homeless shelters.

> There will come a point where normal people have been pushed too far. At that point, COVID will be the least of the anti vaxxers problems.... it will be the enraged community in which they live. And when that happens, there will be hell to pay.

> As soon as I saw the headline I knew it would be this place. The conspiracy touting owner isn't "fed up" with covid restrictions, he was ignoring them and claiming it was all some vast conspiracy from day 1. Currently he's open for business and has been this entire time, even requiring any prospective customers to not wear masks for indoor dining during the height of the pandemic.  He gets attention from his antics which has made his business a mecca for anti-vaxx conspiracists all over the region.

## Northern California hospitals prepare for surge of COVID-19 cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.kcra.com/article/northern-california-hospitals-surge-covid-cases/37137206):

> As most COVID-19 cases are unvaccinated people, health care systems are continuing to prepare and make sure there is enough room for more patients. In June, UC Davis had fewer than 10 COVID patients daily. Sutter Health is also admitting more patients and is still using technology to assist patients across Northern California.

`/u/zardoz88_moot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/osnzbu/northern_california_hospitals_prepare_for_surge/):

> If you really think "well i'm safe, i've got the vaccine" just wait until you need emergency treatment for anything unrelated this fall and get triaged because these morons are melting down the health care system. So yeah, fuck the unvaxxed, but they are still our problem, unless a bill is introduced that unvaxxed people waive their right to treatment... and while its a nice thought ... that's never going it happen. The unvaxxed are still our problem and burden. So get your masks and prepare for more  lockdowns in the fall because this is FAR from over.

## California government, health workers must show proof of vaccination or be regularly tested

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-26/california-state-healthcare-workers-must-show-vaccine-proof?fbclid=IwAR0Eo-MQvPGU1HeSEiU823o7rEH6qK78g2DDISrnN4htaWs4GNGYKi3EjVM):

> California state and healthcare employees will soon be required to show proof they've been vaccinated against COVID-19, with those who remain uninoculated subject to a regular testing regimen, as part of growing national effort to use such screenings in hopes of slowing a new coronavirus surge. The new California guidance is not a vaccine mandate, the likes of which have been announced for municipal workers in some areas of the state, but effectively removes the "Honor system" in which some workers were able to self-attest to their vaccination status. When the additional requirements are in place, state employees who are unvaccinated, or decline to provide proof of vaccination, will be tested for coronavirus infection at least once a week, according to the California Department of Human Resources.

`/u/dillaq` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/os4rcb/california_government_health_workers_must_show/):

> California found a way to have a vaccine mandate without having a vaccine mandate. Employees have to prove they‚Äôre vaccinated or submit to weekly testing.
