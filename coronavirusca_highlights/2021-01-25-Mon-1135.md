> I was a fan of Newsom earlier in the year, and proud of what CA was able to do.  I don't understand what he's doing now.  Everything seems reactive, flailing.  
> 
> Even if this is exactly the right thing to do, it hasn't been convincingly explained.   My biggest concern is yahoos who will now zip out to shop for shoes or whatever the fuck.

## South Bay hospital won't receive more COVID-19 vaccines after it allowed affluent school district to skip the line - San José Spotlight

Summary of [original article](https://sanjosespotlight.com/south-bay-hospital-wont-receive-more-covid-19-vaccines-after-it-allowed-affluent-school-district-to-skip-the-line):

> Santa Clara County will not provide Good Samaritan any more doses of COVID-19 vaccine unless it follows the rules, a sanction issued by health officials after this news organization reported hospital leaders allowed an affluent school district to skip the line and get vaccinated ahead of seniors and other vulnerable populations. Educators are not yet allowed to receive vaccines in Santa Clara County. "Good Samaritan's decision to offer vaccination only to LGUSD staff also rewarded employees of a school district that had provided fundraising that assisted Good Samaritan employees, rather than prioritizing older educators or those from areas of the County with high prevalence of COVID-19," Fenstersheib wrote.

> Good Sam in San Jose let Los Gatos school district staff cut in line in front of hospital workers and the elderly to get vaccinated as a reward for earlier donations.  Staff had to lie and attest under penalty of perjury that they were health care workers when signing up for the shots.

## Gov. Newsom to lift CA’s stay-at-home order Monday: source

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/news/california/gov-newsom-to-lift-stay-at-home-order-monday-source/):

> "California is slowly starting to emerge from the most dangerous surge of this pandemic yet, which is the light at the end of the tunnel we've been hoping for," said California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly in a statement sent just before 8 a.m. The order had shuttered several businesses, prompting lawsuits against the state. Bay Area: 23.4%.Northern California: 41.2%.Greater Sacramento: 11.9%.San Joqauin Valley: 1.3%.Southern California: 0%. California's regional order requires a three week minimum shutdown when an area's total ICU capacity falls below 15%. So when the Bay Area and Northern California surpassed the needed 15% to ditch the order, many desperately waited for word from state officials - which never came. It had been a week since California health leaders last provided specific ICU capacity percentages, the key data point Newsom's administration has said would help determine which regions remain under his mandated stay at home order.

> A lot of people should be fired, immediately. If they can't even tell right from wrong, how can they teach?
