Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/california/csu-plans-to-reopen-its-23-campuses-in-fall-2021/):

> Six days before its application window closes, the California State University system serving nearly half a million students has announced a plan for all 23 of its campuses to reopen next fall after more than a year of virtual instruction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The early announcement is aimed at helping students and families as they plan for next year - and as they decide whether to apply to Cal State, university leaders said. "I urge eligible students across the Golden State to apply for admission to one or more CSU campuses."

## State: ICU capacity now at 0% in San Joaquin Valley

Summary of [original article](https://www.kget.com/news/state-icu-capacity-now-at-0-in-san-joaquin-valley/):

> LODI, Calif. - In San Joaquin County, part of California's vast Central Valley that produces most of the country's fruits and vegetables, the coronavirus is spreading like a weed and the hospitals are running out of beds for the sickest patients. San Joaquin is part of a 12-county region that on Saturday had 100% of its intensive care unit beds filled, the highest rate anywhere in California. With cases continuing at an unprecedented rate, the death toll inevitably will grow, too.

## Bay Area residents go to San Mateo to avoid restrictions

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/12/fleeing-restrictions-in-the-rest-of-the-region-bay-area-residents-head-to-san-mateo-county):

> Attempting to escape the slew of new restrictions that hit most of the region this week, some Bay Area residents are traveling to San Mateo County - one of the last bastions without such mandates - to dine outside, get their hair done and hang onto a small semblance of normalcy that they grew accustomed to the past several months. In his explanation for not acting in concert with the other Bay Area counties, San Mateo County health officer Scott Morrow told residents that "The power and authority to control this pandemic lies primarily in your hands, not mine." Williams, who owns a small hearing aid business in Palo Alto, said he's likely to continue crossing San Francisquito Creek - which forms the border between Santa Clara and San Mateo counties - for lunch when he's tired of getting take-out.

> Burlingame Ave was pretty packed about an hour ago...  with too many people doing that "I'm carrying my drink so I don't need a mask on right now" thing.

## Predictions for next round of restrictions

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kc16ot/predictions_for_next_round_of_restrictions/):

> What and when are you expecting to be the next round of shutdowns in the state as covid continues to spike out of control in the state? Will non-grocery related retail get shut down? Enforced curfews? Coffee shops/take out? What else can be shut down that isn't already shut down in areas under 15% ICU space?

`/u/ohhaijustme` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kc16ot/predictions_for_next_round_of_restrictions/):

> One area in CA has 0 beds left. I don’t think they’ll shut down anything else personally. But this is insane.

## This is the ignorance that I’m surrounded by in my town. I thought it was pretty progressive before the pandemic, these covidiots are changing my mind.

> The whole "I'm healthy so I don't need to wear a mask" thing pisses me off. they completely ignore the fact that asymptomatic cases are extremely high and contagious. Not to mention, many people don't consider mild coughs or stuffy/runny noses to be symptoms of anything. Infuriating.

> Quarantine. Call your doctor to find out where they recommend you get tested.
> 
> Edit: also, best to tell anyone else you’ve come in contact since then as they, too, should quarantine and get tested.
