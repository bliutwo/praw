## California Lockdown Suppressed Excess Pandemic Deaths — the researchers concluded that the first lockdown from March 19 through May 9 lowered the number of excess deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/12/419421/california-lockdown-suppressed-excess-pandemic-deaths):

> Researchers used excess deaths - the number of deaths above what would be predicted in a given year without a mass casualty event - as a rough indicator of the pandemic's overall death toll. Despite the pandemic's high death toll, which continues to climb even as the state endures a second period of sheltering in place, the researchers concluded that the first lockdown from March 19 through May 9 lowered the number of excess deaths for most but not all groups. Excess deaths in these groups continued rising through the lockdown and rose even higher once it was lifted.

> CA did a bait and switch. We were supposed to keep ICU from being overwhelmed and it turned into a “flatten the curve” marathon. Now we’re leading the nation the wrong way. Seems like a huge failure.

> My neighbors have a parking lot filled with people for a party. Me not going to parties stopped nothing. People walk around Santa Rosa stacked up for clothing stores. This is just ridiculous. Nobody cares about the virus except those of us who can’t do enough to give us “herd immunity”. I’m tired of being brow beaten by idiots without masks and losing everything. Screw covid. Screw the government. Screw it all.

The Board of Barbering and Cosmetology issued a statement that said violations of the emergency order could involve the removal of licenses from barbershops and salons. "We don't want to be doing this, any of this. We don't want to be doing this interview today. We just want to open and work. We just want our rights," Ballin said.

> This is depressing as Hell. We've got fundamentalist celebrities inciting people into gatherings, we have *unpleasantly selfish* throwing/attending super-spreader parties (including gun casualties), and we have innocent elderly people getting beaten to death by other patients. All of the first responders in my family are completely horrified and disgusted by **people who do. not. give. a. SHIT. about anybody else** and still go out to drink, shop, and party like nothing's happening. I keep bouncing between furious and wanting to cry over it all.
