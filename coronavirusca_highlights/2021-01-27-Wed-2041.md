> Yeah, "with precautions in place" - now show us the study which says how many schools actually follow them.  What percentage of children and teenagers are following these rules?  Odds are it's not enough.
> 
> The real reason the government is desperate to get kids back in school is because state-sponsored free daycare is the only way to get more parents working and revitalize the economy.  All they care about is money, not our lives.

## Health care worker dies after second dose of COVID vaccine, investigations underway

Summary of [original article](https://www.ocregister.com/2021/01/26/health-care-worker-dies-after-second-dose-of-covid-vaccine-investigations-underway):

> In California, Placer County officials said a man died shortly after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine on Jan. 21. They did not identify the vaccine or the person, but said he had tested positive for COVID in late December and that the vaccine was not given by the Placer County Public Health Department. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System - which officials caution is a "Passive surveillance system" and represents unverified reports of health events that occur after vaccination - has gathered more than 130 reports of death after vaccine administration thus far in 2021.

> His grieving wife is incredibly level-headed:
> 
> 
> “My husband loved what he did. He worked in hospitals for 36 1/2 years. He believed in vaccines. I’m sure he would take that vaccine again, and he’d want the public to take it.
> 
> “But when someone gets symptoms 2 1/2 hours after a vaccine, that’s a reaction. What else could have happened? We would like the public to know what happened to Tim, so he didn’t die in vain. Severe reactions are rare. In reality, COVID is a much more deadly force than reactions from the potential vaccine itself.
> 
> “The message is, be safe, take the vaccine — but the officials need to do more research. We need to know the cause. The vaccines need to be as safe as possible. Every life matters.”

## County of Santa Clara Health System Expands to COVID-19 Vaccination to Individuals Age 65 and Older

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/l5oqal/county_of_santa_clara_health_system_expands_to/):

> Santa Clara County, CA - Officials announced today that the County of Santa Clara Health System is expanding COVID-19 vaccination to individuals age 65 and older, following the State of California's current guidance for vaccine allocation. "As the vaccine becomes available to more of our residents, the County continues its deep commitment to equity and ensuring access for our communities most at risk of contracting COVID-19," said Dr. Jennifer Tong, Associate Chief Medical Officer for the County of Santa Clara Health System. The County received only 20,125 additional first doses of vaccine this week for allocation to the County Health System and other vaccine providers, far fewer doses than health systems in the County have capacity to provide.

> [Edit] For everyone who is frustrated trying to get an appointment when it’s their turn, reading about people jumping the line is disheartening to say the least. Some may not like hearing about it (many apparently) but it needs to be called out to maintain the public trust.
