## Just got back from Oregon, California can learn a thing or two from them

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ifgeta/just_got_back_from_oregon_california_can_learn_a/):

> Things are allowed to be open but things are way more strict. Businesses are extremely strict about distancing and restaurants actually spread people out. It's no wonder they have less cases despite having more things open.

`/u/tejota` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ifgeta/just_got_back_from_oregon_california_can_learn_a/):

> People in Oregon are generally nicer and more courteous than Californians. More likely to follow rules for the sake of others. Here we have larger sections of the population that are resistant to abiding by mask wearing and social distancing. They also have fewer cases so they have the luxury of being more open, by recommend phases guidelines.
