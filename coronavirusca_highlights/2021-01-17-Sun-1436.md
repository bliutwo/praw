## Why some older people are getting the vaccine in Southern California but others are striking out

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-17/some-older-people-get-covid-vaccine-southern-california-others-dont):

> Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer in L.A. County, said during a media briefing Friday that staff at the five mass vaccine sites launching in the county would be trained to follow the flow of traffic at the site and open only the necessary number of vials. The county last week opened a large-scale vaccine distribution center at Disneyland and said it planned to eventually open four others. "As of right now, we have 14,346 doses in our hands as public health, and that is just enough to get through the vaccine clinics we have planned Sunday," Kim Saruwatari, Riverside County public health director, said Friday at a livestreamed meeting with county officials.

## Vaccine Availability in CA

Summary of [original article](https://www.vaccinateca.com/):

> We are calling hospitals and pharmacies daily to check which are currently administering vaccines. Click a pin on the map to see contact information and other info about getting the vaccine. Volunteers have set up a spreadsheet with a simple premise: One person can call each location every day and ask if vaccines are available, and then publish the information for everyone to see.
