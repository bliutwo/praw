Summary of [original article](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/01/06/rep-michelle-steel-tests-positive-covid-19/):

> SANTA ANA - Rep. Michelle Steel, R-Huntington Beach, who was sworn into office on Sunday, announced Wednesday that she has tested positive for COVID-19. The congresswoman, who represents California's 48th District, later condemned the actions of those who stormed the Capitol in a social media post. "Violence is never, ever the answer. As Americans we are blessed with the right to make our voices heard in support of our democracy, but turning to violence is always wrong. I am praying for the Capitol Police today, and am thankful for their work to keep us safe."

> Although in Los Angeles we have yet to prove the new variant is here the numbers speak for themselves. From January to the end of November 2020 LA had 400,000 positive cases. In December alone, we had an additional 400,000 positive cases. Absolutely jaw dropping. I’ve been isolated since February, and now more so, ordering takeout seems too risky. It’s my birthday today and I’ll take my dog for a walk with my dad masked and distanced.  I’d like to go for a walk on the beach at sunset but that’s a 45 min drive, so I’m debating if it’s smart to do that.

## Central Valley hospitals brace for oxygen shortages, lack of space for bodies [Fresno County]

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-06/central-valley-hospitals-brace-for-oxygen-shortages-lack-of-space-for-bodies):

> Like Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley has been hit hard by the pandemic, and its available intensive care unit capacity is 0%. And in this county of nearly 1 million people, there were only 11 available intensive care unit beds on Tuesday. Within the hospitals in Fresno County, officials report they're still able to adequately provide oxygen through the existing infrastructure; they've received help from American Ambulance, a company that provides ambulance service in the county, which has machines to generate oxygen and refill tanks. Fresno County has had one of the highest death rates per capita in the last week of any county in California over the past seven days, ranked 12th of the 58 counties.
