> While this is indeed bad, Florida is right behind us and they have HALF the amount of people we do. But with the hurricane hitting, case numbers are going to lag for them. Texas is also catching up, and they have 10 million LESS people then we do. Case in Point, wear a mask, and social distance.

## The White House reportedly scrapped a national testing plan because the virus was mostly hitting blue states

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/928628/white-house-reportedly-scrapped-national-testing-plan-because-virus-mostly-hitting-blue-states):

> It reportedly had experts developing a testing plan since the virus' beginnings - and then scrapped it entirely once it appeared the virus was largely hitting Democratic states, one expert tells Vanity Fair. Diagnostic testing experts were eventually called in, and the team created a plan to tackle testing supply shortages and delays in reporting results. Perhaps most disturbingly, one member of the team suggested there was no point in rolling out the plan because the virus seemed to be hitting blue states, an expert told Vanity Fair.

> Disgusting. I remember people saying “not my president” during the last administration and thought it was ridiculous. I’ve heard people say it during this administration and thought it was overboard. I’m changing my mind on that. Any disaster in a place that won’t personally benefit the president, he tries to cut any assistance from. He even threatened to cut off funding for California wildfire relief shortly after the camp fire up here. He only considers those people who vote for him “American.” Fuck. Trump. And fuck his administration. There’s blood on all of their hands. Trump supporters, this shit is also on you.

> SAN DIEGO - A gym in San Diego that defied the county's public health order has now been tied to a COVID-19 outbreak and is being ordered to shut down, officials said.
