## Coronavirus: California's largest counties report uptick in cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-californias-largest-counties-report-uptick-in-cases):

> The number of cases of COVID-19 in California ballooned over the weekend as the nation's largest county continued to sort through a significant backlog of tests. In the larger Bay Area, Sonoma, Marin and Santa Cruz counties were the only jurisdictions of any size to report a week-over-week decrease in cases. In the Bay Area, Alameda and Santa Clara counties each reported at least 37% more cases than last week, while the increase in Contra Costa County was about 26%. An uptick in cases in San Francisco two weeks ago appeared to slow in the past week, as the city reported a modest 4% gain over the past seven days.

## Coronavirus: Backlog of cases in Los Angeles fuels California spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-huge-backlog-of-cases-in-los-angeles-county-explains-spike-in-california):

> The number of COVID-19 cases in California spiked Thursday, but it was fueled by a significant backlog of tests reported in the nation's largest county. In total, the 6,359 new cases were, far and away, the most reported in California a single day since Aug. 31, but more than half of those came in Los Angeles County, where there was an estimated backlog of 2,000 cases, county health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. The 3,579 total cases reported Thursday in Los Angeles were quadruple the county's previous daily average and its most in a single day since July 29.
