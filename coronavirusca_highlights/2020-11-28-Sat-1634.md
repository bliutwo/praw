## San Francisco issues new stay-at-home order starting Monday

Summary of [original article](https://missionlocal.org/2020/11/sf-crosses-states-most-restrictive-tier-stay-at-home-order-starts-monday/):

> As Covid-19 cases soar, San Francisco entered the state's most restrictive tier on Saturday, triggering more restrictions on indoor activities and ushering in a limited curfew or stay-at-home order on Monday. In addition to the business restrictions that will kick off this weekend, San Francisco's new purple designation, which is the most-restrictive and suggests viral transmission is "Widespread," means it must abide by a state mandated "Limited stay-at-home" order starting Monday Nov. 30 at 10 p.m. The order requires all nonessential business and activity between people of different households to cease from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. This went into effect Nov. 21 and will continue for purple-tier counties until Dec. 21. San Francisco was pushed from the yellow and least restrictive tier to red on Nov. 16, when the new daily case count was 97.

## Coronavirus hospitalizations worsen in California, raising new alarms

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-28/california-covid-19-hospitalizations-rising):

> The number of people hospitalized with coronavirus infections in California has doubled in just the last two weeks and is rapidly headed to breaking past its summertime high, according to a Times analysis. There were nearly 6,650 people with coronavirus infections in California's hospitals as of Thursday, double the number that existed on Nov. 11, when 3,300 people were hospitalized. Health officials say they suspect the recent surge in coronavirus cases is related to things such as holiday celebrations; gatherings to watch games and celebrations of the Lakers and Dodgers winning the NBA Finals and World Series, respectively; increased outbreaks at workplaces; increased travel by people coming from or returning from areas with high transmission rates; and cooler weather, which tends to result in people staying indoors more.
