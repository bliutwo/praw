## More than 61,000 children got Covid-19 last week, a record

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/more-61-000-children-got-covid-19-last-week-record-n1245851?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma):

> More than 61,000 children in the U.S. were diagnosed with Covid-19 last week - more than in any other week during the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association reported Monday. The percentage of pediatric cases has risen steadily since mid-April, when children accounted for just 2 percent of Covid-19 cases in the country. Children accounted for less than 3.5 percent of current Covid-19 hospitalizations, the report found.

> Can only speak to where I’m at, but the town my wife teaches at, don’t give a fuck. I stopped there as it’s on my commute and groceries are cheap and “nope’d” the fuck right out of a local grocery store. I’d say *generously* half the store had masks on. The school has had to lie and mislead the public as well about the school’s outbreak and their handling of it. They are also not enforcing masks at any level. Even some of the teachers and admin won’t wear them, despite telling the public otherwise. This thing is going to be around for quite some time no matter who wins the election. We have an incredible amount of stupid in this country and even in our state.

## Bay Area in better shape than most of US, but vigilance still needed as COVID-19 cases rise, Stanford doctor says - ABC7 San Francisco

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-map-stanford-bay-area-covid-california/7565934/):

> While there is concern among those we talked with, Stanford's Dr. Dean Winslow says the Bay Area is in much better shape than the state and the country. While we may see certain things like water and paper towels flying off the shelves, Dr. Winslow doesn't think we'll see another shutdown, but he is in favor of a national face-covering mandate. Dr. Winslow believes there is COVID-19 fatigue out there that has contributed to the recent rise in cases around the globe.

> Cases should not be the metric we use.
> 
> Positivity rate, percentage of the population known to be infected, and excess deaths are more appropriate to make informed decisions.
> 
> Absolute case numbers are inadequate and easily sensationalized.

`/u/Kutt4saysWhat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jmwl4u/trump_the_coronavirus_last_week_tonight_with_john/):

> It is understandable why John Oliver went all in. Those of us who have had close relatives and friends catch covid, we have seen what they have went through, and the emotional rollercoaster that we go through. It sucks to feel like you can't do anything, while another person suffers. I wish Trump supporters would listen to people who supported him and then caught covid. Most say they were duped or that they now are taking it seriously. Thank you Mr. Oliver, we hear your pain and we feel your pain.

## The COVID-19, human rights, climate change, international cooperation and economy, all have an impact on US elections. Talking about the healthcare sector, the leading presidential candidates have totally different sets of views and strategies to handle healthcare issues.

Summary of [original article](https://www.delveinsight.com/blog/us-presidential-election-2020-and-healthcare/):

> After various campaigns and two rounds of debates between the leading presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the election is scheduled for 3rd November 2020. The issue of Covid-19 is in the health policy of the presidential candidates and it is closely aligned with major health issues such as Medicare, Medicaid and drug pricing. Like many other countries, drug pricing is one of the most serious healthcare related public concerns in the US. Citizens feel the drug prices are unreasonable and result in high healthcare spending.
