Air quality regulations in Los Angeles County have been temporarily lifted to accommodate the county's growing backlog of cremations. "The Coroner has determined that the current rate of deaths in Los Angeles County is more than double that of pre-pandemic years, and anticipates that another surge is approaching as a result of the New Year's holiday, since deaths tend to occur four to six weeks after gatherings," the order noted.

## New coronavirus variant found in Bay Area | KRON4

Summary of [original article](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/new-coronavirus-variant-found-in-bay-area/):

> SACRAMENTO, Calif. - A new coronavirus variant has been found in the Bay Area, health officials announced Sunday. Santa Clara County Health Director Dr. Sara Cody confirmed the new variant was found in the Kaiser San Jose outbreak that infected dozens of people. The variant was found in several large outbreaks in Santa Clara County, including outbreaks where very high numbers of people exposed contracted the virus.

> This is the variant I mentioned in other comments a couple weeks ago in this sub that was in nearly 50% of recent samples from LA County (samples they took to look for UK variant, which was almost entirely absent). L452R, S13I, and W152C in spike only, in addition to D614G which is in everything now. About time they recognize it could be something. L452R has arisen more than once already and was found in a survey of the effects of spike mutations in one paper to cause increased evasion of antibodies...one of many mechanisms that can increase transmissibility if a lower viral dose can cause illness. 
> 
> A lot of other samples are either Q677R (this originated in WI/MN in August) or P681H which I suspect all have similar effects on the furin cleavage site and could possibly be increasing infectiousness. The UK variant also has P681H but these share no other mutations.
> 
> These are more wild educated speculations btw...but I strongly believe we already have something more transmissible that's homegrown. It's basically an automatic outcome to such a widespread level of infection and attemping half-assedly to fight it yet let infection continue. Plus long term ill convalescent plasma patients seem to breed potent mutants so they could possibly spread from hospital settings much like how they're breeding grounds for antibiotic resistant bacteria.

## L.A. schools chief wants to launch California's largest teacher vaccine effort

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/01/18/los-angeles-schools-leader-want-teachers-vaccinated-now-1357923):

> SACRAMENTO - Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner is calling on state and local health officials to immediately allow the district to turn its more than 1,400 schools into Covid-19 vaccination sites, focusing on shots for teachers and school staff in what would become California's biggest education vaccine push. California has prioritized teachers among vaccine recipients but left distribution up to counties, and there is no large-scale effort yet to inoculate school employees in the state. Beutner asked in a Monday letter to California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer to immediately authorize his school system - the second largest in the U.S. - to vaccinate its teachers and school staff.
