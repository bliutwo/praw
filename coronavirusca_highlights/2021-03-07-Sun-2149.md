> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

> Do you have to be a resident of a county to get a vaccine there?  
> 
> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

`/u/SnoootBoooper` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lzphl8/covid19_california_hits_10_million_vaccine_doses/):

> In my county, we have 65+, healthcare workers, education, childcare, food service, agriculture, and first responders all being vaccinated. And it’s not very hard to get an appointment if you’re computer literate or close with someone who is. 
> 
> I volunteer with a mentorship program and I qualified. My husband drives for door dash and he qualified. Nannies qualify, people that volunteer at the animal shelter qualify. They threw a very wide net and I don’t blame anyone for not jumping out of the way because there seem to be enough appointments around here to get everyone in that wants a shot.

## why has the number of doses administered to SF residents dropped off so precipitously?

Summary of [original article](https://data.sfgov.org/stories/s/COVID-19-Vaccinations/a49y-jeyc):

> The dashboard below shows the number of people who live in San Francisco who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of where they received their vaccinations. The grey bars show the percentage of each category making up the San Francisco population. While SFDPH prioritizes vaccinating San Franciscans 65 years and older, the blue bar might show a higher percentage of 65 and older San Franciscans have received vaccine as compared to the percent of 65 and older San Franciscans in the population.

`/u/CovertFIRE` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/m054hd/why_has_the_number_of_doses_administered_to_sf/):

> Fewer doses have been distributed and the start to transition of  Blue Cross handling it.

## California counties don't want COVID-19 vaccine efforts run by Blue Shield — none of California’s 58 counties having signed the Blue Shield contract yet

`/u/jaceaf` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lz9yom/california_counties_dont_want_covid19_vaccine/):

> They should take over Orange County. It's horrific. The only way to get vaccinated in CA under the new tiers is through MyTurn and local pharmacies and neither is county provided. They set up the most inept waiting system and they are now serving people who signed up feb 15. INEPT
> 
> And Kaiser having a good chunk of vaccine is a good thing, within a week they started serving the new tiers. Not only that, out of network people can get shots there, including second shots that you got somewhere else. The county provides no help if you are looking for a second shot.

## More than 12,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at California child care centers

Summary of [original article](https://localnewsmatters.org/2021/03/04/more-than-12000-coronavirus-cases-have-been-reported-at-california-child-care-centers/):

> The pandemic has led to multiple child care problems in California, including a shortage of care centers, a non-negligible risk of infection even with costly precautions in place, and hardships for child care providers themselves. Kern County, where Ballesteros operates, has seen 425 reported coronavirus cases at child care centers. Child care advocates and a newly formed Child Care Providers United union have been negotiating with the state to get more protections for child care providers - including a one-time stipend to help with increased pandemic-related costs and 16 additional paid non-operational days related to the virus, boosting the total number to 40 annually.

`/u/fertthrowaway` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lz0cws/more_than_12000_coronavirus_cases_have_been/):

> Considering that probably at least 20% of Californians (well 10% just by positive test numbers and not everyone in a household bothers getting tested) have had COVID-19 by this point, it's pretty remarkable that only 1 in 5 daycare centers has even experienced a single case. Not sure what the point of this article is other than proving yet again that transmission at daycares is actually less than in the adult population (plus a large portion of cases are in adult staff, fortunately they are now getting vaccinated).
