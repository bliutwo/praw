## California kept prison factories open. Inmates worked for pennies an hour as COVID-19 spread

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-11/california-prison-factories-inmates-covid-19):

> Amid the drive for production, factories continued to operate even as infections increased inside prison walls, according to interviews with more than 30 inmates at the women's prison in Chino and at Avenal State Prison for men, including some who became infected with the coronavirus. On April 1, the 11-member Prison Industry Board met and agreed to pay prison laborers overtime - though one board member worried that inmates would slow down production "Just to get into the overtime." Statewide, prison authorities say they do not track infections of incarcerated workers separately from the general population, so it is unclear how many of the 15,121 inmates who have tested positive worked in factories or other jobs.

## School reopenings, hybrid learning look different across CA | CalMatters

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/education/2020/10/school-reopening-hybrid-learning-california/):

> In Poway, one of the largest California school districts to attempt reopening campuses, elementary students learning in person will attend their school in cohorts for part of each weekday - either morning or afternoon - and learn asynchronously, or on their own, the rest of the school day. Giving families the option to choose between a hybrid, or blended, model - meaning students split their time learning on campus and at home - and full-time remote learning appears to be the course that many of the state's school districts are charting toward. Hybrid models vary widely across the state, with some school systems offering to bring students back one day a week, others planning on doing so on alternating days and still other schools planning on five days a week under a shortened schedule.

`/u/joyousjoyness` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/j9frpx/school_reopenings_hybrid_learning_look_different/):

>  We're having major battles in our district between parents wanting to reopen as soon as possible, parents wanting to stay closed, etc. Teachers are scared to return, and are afraid their voice will be overridden by parents. It's a mess! With flu season and the holidays approaching, planning ahead is up in the air.

> How is school reopening looking in your area? If you've already reopened, how's it going?

## Newsom's office says to keep masks on between bites when eating out

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Newsom-s-office-says-to-keep-masks-on-eating-15635093.php):

> "Going out to eat with members of your household this weekend? Don't forget to keep your mask on in between bites," read the tweet, accompanied by an illustration of someone doing just that. Going out to eat with members of your household this weekend? Don't forget to keep your mask on in between bites. To be clear, California does not require people dining at restaurants to put their masks back on in between each bite.

> I am a pro lockdown, pro mask person.

> However, isn't giving unrealistic guidance not helping the situation? If its that serious shut down dining.

> &#x200B;
> 
> I feel like asking unrealistic expectations (raising and lowering your mask and sanitizing your hands between) is not really feasible. Are the numbers perhaps higher than reported and they are trying to slow it?
