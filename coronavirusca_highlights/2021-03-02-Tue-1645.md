> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

> Do you have to be a resident of a county to get a vaccine there?  
> 
> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

## [San Diego] Judge granted a temporary restraining order allowing indoor and outdoor high school and youth sports

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/23/coronavirus-preps-does-the-court-system-provide-best-path-back-for-indoor-sports-in-california/):

> A San Diego lawyer who won a court ruling that could pave the way for the return of all youth sports said he planned to file similar lawsuits in San Francisco and other jurisdictions around California, including more in the Bay Area. On Wednesday, a pair of San Francisco high school basketball players became the first to sue a Bay Area county over its coronavirus-related youth sports restrictions, making a similar argument to the one that earned a favorable ruling for high school athletes in San Diego County. Outside of the Bay Area, other lawsuits are expected to be filed in Sacramento, Fresno and San Joaquin counties, Grebing said, totaling 10 to 15 by the end of the week.

## With reopenings in gear, Newsom warns virus cases could shift from drop-off to 'plateau'

`/u/Kyle_PC_61` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lvql1q/with_reopenings_in_gear_newsom_warns_virus_cases/):

> As we continue to vaccinate the most vulnerable, serious negative outcomes are separating themselves from cases. So even while cases drop, hospitalizations are dropping faster.  There's every reason to hope that even if cases plateau very temporarily, casualties will continue to drop.  
> 
> 
> Every time we change even the smallest restriction, some people will act as if we're throwing the doors open on everything immediately and instituting mandatory coughing parties.  It was barely a month ago that Newsom lifted the extended stay-at-home order because ICU usage was projected to drop, and almost every comment from this sub was how he was crazy, there was no \*way\* ICU usage would drop and if it did it would go right back up again, and he was only caving to political pressure.  Newsom was right, the majority of this sub was wrong, ICU usage plummeted.
> 
> California right now is in the best position it's been since the beginning of the pandemic.  Our positivity rate on tests is 2.6%, tied for the lowest it's ever been.  Our hospitalized total has been dropping at a \~25% per week rate for 1.5 months and is on pace to reach the lowest totals of the pandemic in about two weeks.
> 
> And this is all \*before\* a large surge of vaccines is expected to hit the state over the next month.  Vaccinations have a front-loaded effect, where the first 30% of the population we vaccinate represents much more of the risk and much more of the exposure than the last 30%.  That's why we are already seeing such large reductions.  
> 
> 
> Does this mean we should willy-nilly repeal all restrictions immediately? Of course not.  Mass gatherings are still banned.  Most indoor business are still heavily restricted.  Masks are mandated pretty much everywhere.   Not every slight reduction in restrictions represents a catastrophic capitulation to the virus.  
> 
> 
> This thing is ending rapidly.  People are going to have to get used to that idea.  Vaccinations work and we're pumping them into arms at an accelerating rate.  Can we spend the next month arguing over whether 25% capacity dining or outdoor-only dining is acceptable?  Sure, we can.  But by the time we're done arguing about it, it won't matter anymore, because we'll have another month of vaccinations in arms and there will barely be any hospitalizations left.

## Three months after death, San Diego Sheriff’s Department announces first COVID-19 inmate fatality

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/three-months-after-death-san-diego-sheriff-s-department-announces-first-covid-19-inmate-fatality/ar-BB1e8dBR):

> The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has announced that an inmate at the George Bailey Detention Facility in Otay Mesa died of COVID-19 - the first coronavirus jail death department officials have publicly acknowledged. The news, announced late Friday, comes three months after 62-year-old Edel Loredo died from the virus and a month after inewsource first reported it. As of publication, the Sheriff's Department had not included Loredo's death in its COVID-19 jail data, which it publishes online - though it did report in its online data the death of one staff member who died of COVID-19.

## Newsom, legislators strike deal to reopen California schools with $2 billion in incentives for campuses

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-01/newsom-lawmakers-agree-on-plan-to-open-more-california-schools-covid-19):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders announced an agreement Monday to give school districts $2 billion to open schools for students in transitional kindergarten through second grade by April 1, focusing on California's youngest children after almost a year of distance learning. The proposal includes $25 million for a "Safe Schools for All Team" under the state public health department that will be responsible as of March 15 for conducting safety reviews of schools with two or more outbreaks. The push to reopen many California elementary schools in the next few weeks is the first real statewide effort to do so during the current academic year.

> Let’s vaccinate school staff first, no? I fear for teachers, especially those who are over 60.
