## LA mayor Garcetti: I would have acted sooner if Trump hadn't downplayed virus

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/516202-garcetti-no-question-i-would-have-acted-sooner-if-trump-hadnt-downplayed):

> Garcetti said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he would have taken action earlier, and saved lives in the process, if Trump had publicly shared what he said privately to journalist Bob Woodward. Asked after the Woodward recordings were released if he misled the public or downplayed the coronavirus, Trump told reporters, "If you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that's so." Navarro said Trump "Was straightforward," but he did not fully address Tapper's questions in the heated interview regarding Trump's conflicting statements in February between the Woodward interview and a press conference Trump held just days later.

> I like Mayor Garcetti a lot, but come on.  Garcetti isn't listening to Trump.  Never was.  He's just throwing some well earned shade.

## Face masks COULD be giving people immunity...

Summary of [original article](https://news.yahoo.com/face-masks-could-giving-people-123956392.html):

> Face masks may be inadvertently giving people Covid-19 immunity and making them get less sick from the virus, academics have suggested in one of the most respected medical journals in the world. Wearing masks could therefore reduce the infectious dose that the wearer is exposed to and, subsequently, the impact of the disease, as masks filter out some virus-containing droplets. Better still, as data has emerged in recent weeks suggesting that there can be strong immune responses from even mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infection, researchers say that any public health strategy that helps reduce the severity of the virus - such as mask wearing - should increase population-wide immunity as well.
