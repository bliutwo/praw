> New burner account for obvious reasons.

> My wife is a nurse there. Her unit was the first converted to COVID response. She‚Äôs been in the trenches since day one, and it‚Äôs taking a toll on her and everybody she works with. Every day she gets home white as a ghost, drained, famished and looking like she‚Äôs left a war zone. Patients are dying in the parking lot, in the hallways, etc. because there is not critical care capacity left. Nurses are getting sick themselves, and are fatigued that many can‚Äôt muster the strength for any more overtime than they‚Äôre already putting in. They‚Äôve lost beloved coworkers, family, and friends. They‚Äôve watched people die gasping for air and alone, and they don‚Äôt have the time to spare to accompany them in their last moments. 
> 
> They‚Äôve had patients dying, choking on Covid pneumonia, watching Fox News and calling it all a hoax till their moment of death. They drive home past bars with full parking lots, stores filled to the brim with people wearing chin diapers, and past police that refuse to enforce anything. 
> 
> We have failed them. We‚Äôve failed ourselves. We are fucking FAILURES. I‚Äôve lost all pride in this country. I‚Äôm disgusted by the people in our locality. By the anti-maskers. By our president. 
> 
> I wish we could refuse medical care to the people that couldn‚Äôt just wear a fucking mask and stay home. They don‚Äôt deserve the care. I don‚Äôt feel bad saying it. They‚Äôre the reason we‚Äôve been brought to this point. 
> 
> I take protecting my wife and my children more seriously than any other role I have. I can‚Äôt protect her from this. She‚Äôs laying next to me now famished, scared, and disappointed too. I can‚Äôt help her. I do everything I can at home, cook the meals, tend to the animals and children, clean the house, do the laundry, and it‚Äôs not enough. She deserves better. We deserve better. Our culture is broken and I‚Äôm losing hope. I don‚Äôt know if I can ever go back to believing in the innate goodness of people after this. I think it was a lie I always told myself because I couldn‚Äôt stand to believe the alternative.

## California teachers‚Äô unions affirm opposition to opening schools without more safety precautions | EdSource

Summary of [original article](https://edsource.org/2020/california-teachers-unions-affirm-opposition-to-opening-schools-without-more-safety-precautions/645460):

> As the pandemic continues to spread in a seemingly uncontrolled fashion, California's leading teachers' unions have affirmed their opposition to school openings without significantly more safety precautions, further complicating hopes for bringing more students back to school for in-person instruction. The California Teachers Association on Wednesday sent a letter to lawmakers saying that even those schools in purple counties that are already offering in-person instruction should not be allowed to do so. The teachers' unions are not the only ones to have expressed dire concerns about opening schools for in-person instruction.

## Only Seven of Stanford‚Äôs First 5,000 Vaccines Were Designated for Medical Residents

Summary of [original article](https://www.propublica.org/article/only-seven-of-stanfords-first-5-000-vaccines-were-designated-for-medical-residents):

> Stanford Medicine residents who work in close contact with COVID-19 patients were left out of the first wave of staff members for the new Pfizer vaccine. In a letter to Stanford leadership sent on Thursday, the chief resident council wrote, "While leadership is pointing to an error in an algorithm meant to ensure equity and justice, our understanding is this error was identified on Tuesday and a decision was made not to revise the vaccine allocation scheme before its release today." The council asked for a timeline for vaccination of the residents and transparency regarding the algorithm. In response to the residents' protests, Dr. Niraj Sehgal, chief medical officer, sent an email saying, "Please know that the perceived lack of priority for residents and fellows was not the intent at all." He added that with the anticipated authorization of Moderna's vaccine, "We're increasingly confident in getting everyone vaccinated, including all of you." He signed off with "Heartfelt apologies."
