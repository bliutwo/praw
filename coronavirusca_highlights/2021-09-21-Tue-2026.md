## Big demand makes COVID-fighting antibodies hard to get in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-21/monoclonal-antibody-covid-treatment-hard-to-get-california):

> Monoclonal antibodies have been developed as a treatment for COVID-19. Recently, the nation has seen a twentyfold increase in demand for monoclonal antibodies; as a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is reserving the treatment for areas hit hardest by the pandemic, said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, a deputy health officer for Orange County. The Fresno County health official said he'd like the state to increase access to monoclonal antibody treatments for more Californians.

> These should be going to high risk vaccinated people first. It was not created as an alternative to the vaccine, it was created for high risk people who need additional antibodies to combat the virus.

## Column: L.A.â€™s first responders are suing for the right to put themselves and public at risk

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-18/lopez-column-l-a-first-responders-vaccine-mandate-lawsuits):

> On a private social media site shown to me by a county source, county firefighters have been sharing information on discredited COVID-19 remedies, strategizing on how to combat vaccine mandates and attacking the county Board of Supervisors. One argument I've gotten repeatedly from firefighters is that they've survived COVID-19 and their natural immunity is as good or better than what the vaccine provides, so why take the risk of side effects? Along with that argument is the claim that this is a case of government overreach. While there are some vaccine side effects, Brewer said, they are statistically tiny, and overwhelmed by the extraordinary benefits of vaccines "That are among the most intensely tested vaccines ever" and have prevented millions of cases of serious illness, hospitalization and death.

> Fire and police are two jobs that have always had more applications than positions.  Seems like a recipe for a lot of easy decisions

## New data affirm it. L.A. County school safety policies are working as COVID rates are low

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-16/declining-covid-19-cases-indicate-safe-la-school-openings):

> Outbreaks are defined as linked cases involving three or more people in which transmission probably occurred at schools or during school activities. "We feel comfortable that, with relatively low transmission at schools, it's appropriate to offer schools a modified quarantine option for K-12 students exposed to COVID at schools," Ferrer said during a news conference. Ferrer said school districts are not required to adopt the policy, and they should make sure they have the resources necessary to investigate cases.

`/u/yinyang_yo_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/pqc3f6/new_data_affirm_it_la_county_school_safety/):

> Three things that help a lot
> 
> 1. Parents cooperating with the schools. Of course there are some testy parents who really think the rules are a pain in the ass, but generally speaking, parents are willing to work with the schools to keep their own kids and everyone else's safe
> 2. High community vaccination rate. 3/4ths of eligible people, including the grades 7-12 ppl, are vaccinated and there are vaccination drives on school campuses all the time
> 3. Masks in schools. They work. That's it.
