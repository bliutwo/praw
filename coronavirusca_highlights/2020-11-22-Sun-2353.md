Summary of [original article](https://la.eater.com/2020/11/22/21590433/coronavirus-los-angeles-covid-19-closure-restaurants-outdoor-dining-public-health-order):

> Public health officials have announced that outdoor dining at restaurants across Los Angeles County will shut down on Wednesday, November 25.

> Yes but I remember when the helmet law went into effect.  All these people protested it.  Gary busey spoke out against it.  Then he got into a motorcycle accident and got brain damaged.  He still was against the helmet law.  You’re just young and probably didn’t live through it.  There was a big fight at the time about it.

> 1 in 30 people in LA have tested positive for covid-19. I assume many more had it and didn't test positive. People seem to just not give a fuck based on the parties I've seen in my apartment complex and the crazy high percentage of people who don't wear a mask in the hallways and elevators (I'd estimate it at 30-40%).

> Filled it out but you may want to post on non-Coronavirus subreddits since generally people following these subs are more open to the idea that it is a dangerous disease which we must follow and stay up-to-date on. Just in the interest of science :)
