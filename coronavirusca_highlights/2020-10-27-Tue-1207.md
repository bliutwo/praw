## Coronavirus: California's largest counties report uptick in cases

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/coronavirus-californias-largest-counties-report-uptick-in-cases):

> The number of cases of COVID-19 in California ballooned over the weekend as the nation's largest county continued to sort through a significant backlog of tests. In the larger Bay Area, Sonoma, Marin and Santa Cruz counties were the only jurisdictions of any size to report a week-over-week decrease in cases. In the Bay Area, Alameda and Santa Clara counties each reported at least 37% more cases than last week, while the increase in Contra Costa County was about 26%. An uptick in cases in San Francisco two weeks ago appeared to slow in the past week, as the city reported a modest 4% gain over the past seven days.

> I've been telling you guys, nobody is going to protect you but yourselves. Federal government threw in the towel. State can only do so much when businesses openly flout the rules, the police officers come out saying they won't enforce anything, and a sizable portion of the population pride themselves on not wearing a mask.
> 
> Wear your mask. Probably wear some goggles/glasses too. Don't go anywhere you don't need to go. Get in and get out. If you see someone without a mask, don't confront, keep a wide berth. This shit is not going anywhere. In order to beat it, we would have to work together but that's not happening when 40% of the population thinks it's a hoax to hurt their God Emperor.

## As Dodgers and Lakers win, coronavirus spreads at celebrations, alarming health officials

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-27/coronavirus-spreading-at-sports-celebrations-lakers-dodgers):

> Southern California counties are reopening their economies at a slower pace than other parts of the state, and officials blame celebrations. New coronavirus cases, dated by the date of a positive coronavirus test or onset of symptoms, have been rising in recent weeks in Los Angeles County. State officials announced last week they will devote more resources to Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including increasing mobile testing and helping those infected to isolate themselves while they recover.

> Excerpt: 
> 
> > Southern California counties are reopening their economies at a slower pace than other parts of the state, and officials blame celebrations. Lakers and Dodgers viewing parties and public events are keeping coronavirus infections high enough to hold the region back, officials warn.
> 
> > California has avoided the substantial spike in coronavirus cases seen across the country this fall, but some of the state’s most populated counties — Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino — remain in the most restrictive reopening tier.
> 
> > That means indoor dining rooms are shut, as are indoor operations of gyms and houses of worship. San Diego County, now in the red tier, is teetering on backsliding into the most restrictive category.
> 
> > Public health officials have identified gatherings as a significant source of virus transmission in Southern California, where young adults are driving the spread of the highly contagious disease.
> 
> 
> > There are also troubling signs of a potential increase in coronavirus cases. Even after accounting for a backlog, Los Angeles County has gone from about 940 daily new cases at the beginning of October to nearly 1,200 new cases each day as of last week, based on the date of a positive test or the first onset of symptoms, said Barbara Ferrer, the county’s director of public health.
