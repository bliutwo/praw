## Dying of Covid in a ‘Separate and Unequal’ L.A. Hospital

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/us/covid-los-angeles.html):

> In the intensive care unit on Jan. 21, Mr. Virgen became No. 207 on the hospital's list of Covid-19 fatalities; Mr. Flores, just down the hall, became No. 208.The New York Times spent more than a week inside the hospital, during a period when nearly a quarter of all Covid inpatients there were dying, despite advances in knowledge of the disease. A new study of patients at 168 hospitals found that about half of Covid patients on ventilators died, and survival varied widely among hospitals. Dr. Theodore J. Iwashyna, a critical care physician at the University of Michigan, said the differences in hospital outcomes reflected a "System choice." He and others have studied patients with complex pulmonary conditions and found that those treated at smaller hospitals with fewer resources and less experience in managing them tend to have poorer survival rates.
