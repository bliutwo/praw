> I'm in LA and at least in the city. I have not seen a human being without a mask completely covering their face, save one jogger, in weeks. 
> 
> Have you looked at other states on snap maps? I'd say if anything people here are following covid regulations more so than anywhere in the county. 
> 
> Give us all some credit. 
> 
> I think some serious number crunching would reveal how little outdoor dining contributes to the spread of COVID-19. It sucks public health departments seem to choose restaurants and penalize them more than any other group.

## Op-Ed: On the COVID frontlines, we're tired of hearing lame excuses for risky behavior [LA Times]

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-23/medical-workers-angry-lame-coronavirus-excuses):

> The problem is, people don't understand the danger. COVID doesn't care how you vote, where you live or if you die. People back home collected rubber and bacon grease for years, gave up countless liberties and luxuries, and no one ever called the war a hoax, even if they never saw a Nazi in their backyard.

`/u/customerny` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jztn6f/oped_on_the_covid_frontlines_were_tired_of/):

> I am sorry Mr. Morocco but your article while well written will fall on deaf ears. If you think that public will stop getting together on Thanksgiving in few days or coming up Christmas /New York you're highly mistaken. You're also mistaken in your thinking that public will put on mask and /or will social distance once vaccine is readily available. There is only so much public is willing to do and it's not much at all. It should be evidence by now that public is only willing to do as long it do not inconvenience them, once it does they they stop complying.
