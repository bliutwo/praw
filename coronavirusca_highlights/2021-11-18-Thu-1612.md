## All California adults can now make appointments for COVID vaccine boosters

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/california/all-california-adults-can-now-make-appointments-for-covid-boosters/):

> The update to the state's appointment website came after the California state health officer Dr. Tómas Aragón last week sent a letter to vaccine providers throughout the state, telling them: "Do not turn a patient away who is requesting a booster." On Tuesday, the California Department of Public Health updated its guidance on boosters, clarifying that the boosters are available to all adults once the appropriate time has passed since getting previous shots. Now, L.A. County's vaccine website says boosters are "Recommended" for everyone 18 and older and "Strongly recommended" for people who are 65 and older, have underlying health conditions or are at risk of exposure at work or in the community.

## Measures taken last year to prevent spread of COVID also prevented the Flu. Flu infections on the rise leaves me worried about COVID cases ‘KQED: Flu Infections On the Rise After Hitting Historic Low Last Winter’

> I’ve also been concerned about the flu swinging back around and sucker punching us this season since last season it was all but eradicated due to covid measures like distancing and masking last winter. 
> 
> Just got my flu shot Monday. I chose to not get the covid booster and flu shot at the same time, so split them a week apart. I’ve never had a weird reaction to the flu shot, but didn’t want to risk it since the covid shot came with a bunch of side effects for me. But I have heard that a lot of places are offering them together, so if you’re feeling brave, killing 2 birds with 1 stone is an option! 
> 
> I’ve been getting the flu shot since 2009, after a friend of mine died from complications from the flu. It’s not always prevented me from getting sick, but it’s always prevented me from getting THAT sick. I’ll take a few days of feeling like crap over a week or more of being unable to leave my bed.

## Why Gavin Newsom extending the COVID state of emergency matters

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/california-politics/article/Gavin-Newsom-COVID-emergency-powers-16625463.php?IPID=SFGate-HP-CP-Spotlight):

> Nov. 17, 4 a.m. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has extended his state's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration through March 2022, which means he will have had emergency powers for a full two years. In a statement released last week, Newsom's office wrote, "The state of emergency ensures the state can continue to respond quickly to evolving conditions as the pandemic persists. As we have seen, this virus and variants are unpredictable. The state of emergency will be ended once conditions no longer warrant an emergency response." If the health expert consensus that COVID-19 will become endemic like the seasonal flu or common cold is correct and the state will have "COVID season" every winter, would that mean the state will remain under an indefinite state of emergency year-to-year?

`/u/tehrob` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qw4cvj/why_gavin_newsom_extending_the_covid_state_of/):

> March was about the time last year that we saw a decrease in the wave of "holiday/winter" infections.  Our largest peak of infections, hospitalizations, and death were between about the end of October to the middle of February.  Isee March as an appropriate next step in this, no longer emergent emergency.  We will see how the booster/vaccines do this year, and see if they make a big difference.  They should.

## LA Covid-19 Healthvana vaccination QR in Apple Wallet does not reflect booster doses.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qwar6a/la_covid19_healthvana_vaccination_qr_in_apple/):

> Noticed that the Healthvana QR card available for Apple Wallet does not reflect booster doses, and the website has no form to add it. Curious if there are other digital COVID cards to add to Apple Wallet that will show the booster dose so you don't have to carry the physical card around.

> in THEORY - YMMV, obviously, the place where you got your booster should be updating your ***existing*** record in the state system. so if you put your "CA QR code" in your wallet already, it should be updated... ?

## Amazon to pay California $500,000 for 'concealing' COVID cases among workers

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/amazon-covid-outbreak-workplace-safety-right-to-know-penalty):

> Amazon has agreed to pay $500,000 to better enforce state consumer protection laws after California's attorney general said the company has concealed COVID-19 case numbers from its workers. Among other requirements outlined Monday, Amazon must notify its tens of thousands of warehouse workers of any new COVID-19 cases within one day and disclose the exact number of cases in their workplace. Last year, then-Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra began an investigation into whether Amazon was doing enough to protect its workers from the risk of infection amid the pandemic and sued to force the e-commerce giant to comply with outstanding investigative subpoenas requesting information including data on the number of COVID-19 infections and related deaths at some 150 Amazon facilities in California.

## Senior Independent Living and Unvaccinated Visitors

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qvfbe4/senior_independent_living_and_unvaccinated/):

> Can someone explain why it's legal for a Senior Independent Living Facility to only have an honor system for screening visitors? My unvaccinated family members keep visiting my grandma and they do the electronic check-in and say they are vaccinated. What's the legal reason these facilities cannot ask for a vaccination card? Is this a county by county legality or state-wide? SF venues and restaurants can ask for a CDC card but my unvaccinated family can just walk in to an indoor living facility for seniors, many of whom are overdue for their boosters?

`/u/katgtak` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/qvfbe4/senior_independent_living_and_unvaccinated/):

> Self-screening for symptoms/ known exposure is ok, but licensed facilities should be actually verifying vaccination status or proof of negative test w/in 72hrs ([GUIDANCE](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/CCLD/PINs/2021/ASC/PIN-21-40-ASC.pdf)). If they are not, they are not in compliance with their licensing agency. 
> 
> These types of concerns can be reported to the local Ombudsman (patient safety advocates), who work closely with the county/ state public health depts to help protect these high-risk residents ([INFO](https://www.aging.ca.gov/Programs_and_Services/Long-Term_Care_Ombudsman/)).
