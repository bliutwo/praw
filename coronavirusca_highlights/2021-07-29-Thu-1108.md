Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Frustration-with-the-unvaccinated-mounts-even-as-16347426.php):

> In the Bay Area, where universal masking recommendations have been in effect for all counties but Solano for nearly two weeks, many people interviewed by The Chronicle on Wednesday expressed near-unanimous support for masking up again for the sake of protecting others - especially younger children, who aren't eligible to be vaccinated yet. "Wearing a mask and getting a shot is is not some Big Brother thing," Tatyana Grats said. Both are in favor of the new masking guidance and have kept wearing masks indoors in public spaces despite already being vaccinated.

> My wife questioned me when I spent $40 on another batch of masks for the family a couple of weeks ago.  I take absolutely no pleasure in being vindicated but I’m prepared to carry on as long as needed.
> 
> > “If people refuse to get vaccinated, it’s going to be hard to end the pandemic,” he said. “I’m not really angry at these people. I just find them stupid. I understand everyone has freedom and all that, but I really don’t get this.”

## New CDC advice: Most vaccinated Californians should wear masks indoors | Under the CDC’s new mask recommendations, vaccinated people in 45 California counties — all of its most populous areas — are advised to wear masks in public indoor places.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/california-covid-mask-guidelines/):

> Nearly all vaccinated Californians should return to wearing masks indoors under new federal guidelines issued today for areas where COVID-19 is surging. The CDC also recommended today that vaccinated people in all areas of the country wear masks indoors if they are immunocompromised or have a higher risk of severe disease if infected, or if they live with someone who is. Under the state's current mask guidelines, vaccinated people do not have to wear masks indoors except on public transit and in settings including hospitals, schools, prisons, nursing homes and homeless shelters.

`/u/WestFast` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ot2xu0/new_cdc_advice_most_vaccinated_californians/):

> I’ve never stopped wearing my masks indoors. Too many country anti vax types around here.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/otqbmv/is_ca_notify_accurate/):

> In major change, California recommends everyone wear masks indoors again. California's biggest state worker union challenges Gavin Newsom's vaccine order. California restaurant, fed up with restrictions, encourages "Unvaccinated" customers only.

`/u/tehrob` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/otqbmv/is_ca_notify_accurate/):

> Volunteer California Contact Tracer for my County for over a year now here, I send out codes to people who have use it when I talk to the about their Covid-19 status. 
> 
> The functionality is different on Android and iOS devices.  On both it is opt in, on Android by downloading an app called CA Notify, on iOS by activating a setting called "exposure events" I believe.  
> 
> Once active, it uses bluetooth to constantly ping a special unique code out to other people in the area that meet a criteria set my the State.  I think this equates to  ~6 feet for ~15 minutes.  It relies on bluetooth strength, not distance obviously.
> 
> If you test positive, you will(should at least) get a call from a local friendly Contact Tracer, and they will conduct an interview with you, to a)find out how you are doing, b)offer to reach out to your friends, coworkers and family and anonymously notify them that they have been exposed to "someone".  They only use the date and approximate time if they have it that they were exposed.  c) Offer you resources you might need in case you need them to continue Isolating.
> 
> The phone functionality is basically an automated version of process "b)" that doesn't share your name, just an exposure event and time.  Not even a place.  You have to do that math on your own.
> 
> So, if you are relying on that alone, to alert your friends and family, please reconsider talking to your County's contact tracers by calling (916)262-7553 and ask them to call your close contacts, or at the very least use the free and anonymous https://tellyourcontacts.org/
> 
> It could stop the spread that may otherwise occur.  Thank you!
