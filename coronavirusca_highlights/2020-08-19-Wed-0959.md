## San Diego County Taken Off State's Coronavirus Watch List

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-taken-off-states-coronavirus-watch-list/2387632/?fbclid=IwAR3QIOtqW5wLRJ-5oLhuiyDzUvEMukEE_xFcqAmLXxebW3U5NPCfm-JsUcc):

> Following several days of data trending in a positive direction, San Diego County has been taken off of California's monitoring list. The state announced that as of Tuesday, San Diego County has been removed from its watch list since it's been three days that the county has had an average of less than 100 cases reported per 100,000 residents. What it does mean is that schools K-12 will be able to reopen for in-person education as soon as Sept. 1 if San Diego County can remain off the state's watch list for another 14 days.

> "It is up to the state to decide when and how businesses will be allowed to reopen, Wooten said. So far, that guidance has not yet been received leaving hundreds of San Diego County businesses in limbo."
> 
> Is there no limit to the confusion and delays?  Why would businesses not be able to reopen?

## Getting mask shamed at a National Park

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ibmh3n/getting_mask_shamed_at_a_national_park/):

> I'd say there were about 75% of people wearing masks and 25% not. The part that is really bothering me is people making really rude comments to us and probably others FOR wearing masks while in front of our children. It's just so frustrating that people feel okay with using bad language in front of kids wearing masks and basically directing the comments at them too since it was our entire family they were shouting at.

`/u/ErikCavey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ibmh3n/getting_mask_shamed_at_a_national_park/):

> Insane. You’d think that someone not wearing a mask wouldn’t want to confirm their self-centered, thoughtless nature. :/
