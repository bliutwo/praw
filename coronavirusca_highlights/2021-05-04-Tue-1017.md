## California coronavirus case rates keep 'falling like a rock' despite surges in Oregon, Washington

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-03/california-coronavirus-cases-fall-amid-oregon-washington-surges):

> Even as Oregon and Washington face new COVID-19 surges, there is growing optimism that California remains in recovery mode as coronavirus cases continued to fall dramatically along with related deaths. There are now fewer than 2,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases a day on average over the past week in California, a huge drop from about 45,000 cases a day at the peak of the surge in December and January. There hasn't been a troubling surge in California and Arizona, which have observed more cases of the California variant than the U.K. variant.

## Younger Californians have lowest vaccination rate, sparking concern. Officials fear the low rate could seed more outbreaks as the economy reopens

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/30/younger-californians-have-lowest-vaccination-rate-sparking-concern/):

> As the Bay Area pushes toward community immunity from COVID-19, experts worry that the region could be held back by younger people whose vaccination rates so far trail other groups. Statistically, that's true, but it's also true that younger people have the highest infection rates and can transmit the virus to those who are far more vulnerable. Younger people should be targeted with a more specific stick-and-carrot approach, said UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong.

`/u/kethnguy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n35uu7/younger_californians_have_lowest_vaccination_rate/):

> Yeah no shit. Itâ€™s only been 2 weeks since opening up for all age groups. Give it time.
