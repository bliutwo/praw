## COVID-19 cases spike in California after holidays. Spread linked to family gatherings

> Since July 4, 37 of the state's 58 counties have seen case counts at least double, especially in more rural counties and those in the Central Valley, according to California Department of Public Health data analyzed by The Desert Sun. "There are not sufficient data to assess the impact of July Fourth festivities," a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Desert Sun.Asked whether the holiday contributed to the surge, Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at UC Irvine, answered, "Yes. But." With the state and the country moving in fits and starts toward reopening, numerous factors come into play. Intimate gatherings are drivers of new casesCounty health officials throughout California are increasingly reporting that close social gatherings and spread of the virus within a household are larger drivers of transmission than tourism.

## Starting An Essential Worker (Cashier) Job On Monday. I'm Terrified

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i27ifl/starting_an_essential_worker_cashier_job_on/):

> I was working from home until June when I lost my Job. I was initially really happy to get the Job as I really need the money. I feel like I am risking my own life and my parents lives by taking this job.

`/u/Amandab805` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/i27ifl/starting_an_essential_worker_cashier_job_on/):

> Just remember that when people are rude and disrespectful and defiant about masks, it’s not you, it’s them. People tend to take things on those that can’t really defend themselves without fear of retribution. There are more kind, reasonable people in this world than there are jerks, so remember, it’s not you, it’s them.
