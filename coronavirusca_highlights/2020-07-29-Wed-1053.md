## Gov. Newsom withholds coronavirus money from 2 defiant cities

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/california-withholds-virus-money-from-2-defiant-cities):

> SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gavin Newsom is using new powers to withhold money from two cities in California's Central Valley that are defying his health orders by allowing all businesses to open during the pandemic. Newsom blocked nearly $65,000 from Atwater in Merced County and more than $35,000 from Coalinga in Fresno County, the first installments of $2.5 billion in federal funds that cities and counties across the state risk losing if they don't toe the line on coronavirus safeguards. The state's Office of Emergency Services sent letters to the cities last week notifying officials that they risked losing more money if they didn't withdraw resolutions defying the state's orders.

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/3-food-suppliers-in-l-a-county-ordered-to-close-after-significant-coronavirus-outbreaks/):

> Three food suppliers in Los Angeles County were ordered to close due to "Significant" coronavirus outbreaks among their employees, officials said Monday. Workplaces, food and retail stores and educational settings in L.A. County have to report outbreaks to the health department after they've had at least three people test positive for the virus. Health inspectors visit businesses seven days a week, investigating more than 17,000 locations reported to the department since March for not complying with health officer orders meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

> > my mom works for a food processing plant lets just say they provide food for the Golden Arches the most recognized fast food chain in the world. They have had out breaks since the pandemic started they have also had deaths and June and July they have had numerous covid cases and my mom included. The day my mother called out July 13, 47 other employees called out sick for the first time due to covid. That was just one day and every day after they had reported cases. Employees where started to get scared and hoping they wouldn’t be next. The health departed payed them a visit last week and found that everything was compliant. Finally today the health department shut them down. Well they make all the food for this fast food chain in this state and most of Western U.S. so if they can’t produce food for them they might have to close locations depending how long this shut down last. In all honesty the health of the employees is what matters my mom has several coworkers in the hospital.

I kept telling my mom to eat lunch outside or alone in her car I even got her a portable table and chair so she can keep in her and pull out during lunch."
