Dr. Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County's public health officer, said of the county's first case of MIS-C: "While this case is not known to be linked to any school, it's a reminder we need to pay attention to COVID-19 in kids and its potential long- and short-term effects."

> So much for the CDC being a independent branch of the government basing their decisions on science. Even the phase 3 trials that are running aren't expected to complete until next year.

> You'd have to be a lunatic to operate a small business in California or especially in San Francisco.  There is zero consideration for what it takes to run a business and survive.

## Did a state change in regulations dramatically increase testing costs for businesses?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/imhaxf/did_a_state_change_in_regulations_dramatically/):

> The words "Subject to" and "Now able to" make it sound like there was a change that insurance companies are now exploiting to raise costs for anyone who is not using the state sites. This burned the Woodland Hills zipper manufacturer that was testing employees regularly using a testing company, Kyla, that interfaced with manufacturer's insurer, UnitedHealthCare. Kyla must now pay upfront for testing and the company often won't know for 45 days or longer whether the insurer will reimburse it for any of the costs.

## Some Bay Area beaches will close for Labor Day. Is it worth it?

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/01/coronavirus-some-bay-area-beaches-will-close-for-labor-day-is-it-necessary/):

> All Santa Cruz County and city beaches will be shut part of the weekend and all day Monday, with similar restrictions expected throughout Monterey Bay - meaning no suntanning or beach brews to distract from scorching temperatures. Pebble Beach plans to close its iconic 17-Mile Drive and all Del Monte Forest beaches, while the Monterey City Council ratified an order Tuesday to close all beaches over the weekend. The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat watch for the Bay Area and Monterey from Friday through Tuesday, forecasting triple-digit temperatures in the South Bay, Santa Cruz Mountains and inland Monterey County, with San Francisco and the North Bay trailing behind in the mid-70s to 80s. For prior holiday weekends, beaches from Pacifica to Monterey closed down parking or otherwise curtailed access to keep hordes of people away.

> One of the big issues is that coastal communities were getting inundated by those in inland counties, or even other states. And those people don't ONLY go to the beach - they are there for several days and are visiting restaurants, shops, basically anywhere that is open, and if they feel safe enough travelling during a pandemic, are probably not taking many precautions. While that sounds like a problem for tourists that will infect each other by crowding tourist areas, workers in those restaurants and shops are local and "essential," and that is the population that is getting hammered right now by the virus.
> 
> On a small scale, an individual is safer at the beach than at a family party. But inviting thousands of out-of-towners to the beach for a holiday weekend during a pandemic is going to result in illness and death for people that have to work, and their family members.
> 
> It's a pandemic - if people can't take it seriously and stay home, we need to close stuff down.
