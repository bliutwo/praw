Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/01/07/cdc-reports-22-california-cases-of-coronavirus-variant-first-identified-in-uk/):

> At least 52 cases of a coronavirus variant first identified in the UK have been found in the United States, according to data posted Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes at least 26 cases in California, 22 cases in Florida, two cases in Colorado, and one case each in Georgia and New York. CDC says this does not represent the total number of cases circulating in the US, but rather just those that have been found by analyzing positive samples.

> Seeing how so many people decided to give up on the virus, despite it not giving up on us, this doesn’t surprise me in the least bit.

## L.A. using coronavirus test that FDA warns may produce false negatives

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/fda-warns-that-curatives-covid-19-test-used-by-the-city-of-l-a-may-be-inaccurate):

> The guidance from the Food and Drug Administration warns healthcare providers and patients that the test made by Curative, a year-old start-up founded in Silicon Valley that supplies the oral swab tests at L.A.'s 10 drive-through testing sites, carries a "Risk of false results, particularly false negative results." The conflicting approaches raise new questions about the accuracy of the city's coronavirus positivity rates, including whether false negatives gave people the erroneous assumption they could ignore public health guidance and gather with others outside their households, contributing to a record-high level of community spread. Garcetti, responding to questions at a news conference Thursday, agreed that the Curative test is designed for screening people who are visibly ill, but he added that the tests are also effective at catching cases in people who are asymptomatic. A Curative representative said in a statement that the company's test "Has been validated and is being offered during the pandemic under an Emergency Use Authorization, and is labeled with specific warnings, precautions, and limitations that FDA reiterated in the Safety Communication. The test performance and labeling have not changed, nor has the company observed any changes in test performance."

> If you used one of the oral tests and you were not showing signs of Covid, you might have gotten a false negative. It might be one of the reasons Covid has exploded in SoCal.
