> Call/Email a complaint to the department of health for LA county. From my understanding, you should have been told you were in contact with an employee(s) who tested positive, but can’t be told who that person was.

## COVID: UCSF Infectious Disease Expert Says Indefinite Stay-at-Home Order Wrong Call, Not Data-Driven

Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/03/covid-ucsf-infectious-disease-expert-says-indefinite-stay-at-home-order-wrong-call-not-data-driven/):

> It'll likely stay relatively quiet, since San Francisco has extended its stay-at-home and 10-day travel quarantine orders indefinitely. UCSF infectious disease expert and medical director of the HIV Clinic at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Director Dr. Monica Gandhi says the city's decision is not data-driven. San Francisco just extended stay-at-home orders indefinitely which is not indicated by CA state parameters or current rates of hospitalizations/ICU capacity so I hope New Year will bring SFDPH and Mayor to start considering the loss of jobs, impact on poor, overdose deaths, etc.

`/u/Lizakaya` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kqb3fr/covid_ucsf_infectious_disease_expert_says/):

> Also from Ghandi, ““We never reached those hospitalizations or ICU capacity concerns that the state had set as metrics for this degree of shutdown,” she said. “And then to continue it indefinitely, as kind of our New Year’s present to San Francisco, didn’t make sense to me.” But the article also states that the sah order has slowed transmission in SF.

## L.A. homeless sites 'overwhelmed' by COVID-19: 'These are the toughest times' — The virus is hitting people living in L.A. County homeless shelters, after months of surprise it had not already ravaged a vulnerable community.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-01-03/homeless-shelters-coronavirus-surge-hospitals):

> Though infections among the homeless have generally lagged slightly below the county's per capita rate, belying early predictions of devastating outbreaks in shelters and encampments, the December surge has brought a spike in the homeless numbers as well, further straining the overstretched services system. As a result, the sites are now predominantly occupied by homeless people, she said. Early in the pandemic, homeless services and healthcare providers worked desperately to slow the transmission in homeless populations.
