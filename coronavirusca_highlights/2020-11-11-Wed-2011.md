## San Francisco to Roll Back Select Activities in Response to Increase in COVID-19 Cases | Office of the Mayor

Summary of [original article](https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-roll-back-select-activities-response-increase-covid-19-cases):

> San Francisco, CA - Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the City will adjust its reopening due to a significant and rapid increase in COVID-19 case rates in San Francisco, coupled with the current increase in cases and hospitalizations in California and across the United States. San Francisco is rolling back these activities in an effort to contain the spread of the virus by focusing on higher risk indoor activities and other behaviors that increase the concentration of aerosols. "From the beginning of the City's pandemic response, San Francisco has carefully monitored and responded to the pandemic, which has helped us lead the country in our containment," said Dr. Grant Colfax, San Francisco Director of Health.

> Sure they will. Yes, they’ll get moved to a more restrictive tier.  But, the half-assing of following the health orders, and minimal enforcement will not change. I’m jaded, in LA County, though where we probably won’t move to a lower tier until spring.
