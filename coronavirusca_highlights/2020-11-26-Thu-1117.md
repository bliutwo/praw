> My husband was exposed at work. Thursday, he was showing symptoms and he tested positive on Sunday. I started feeling sick Saturday. We're quarantined together away from our 4 kids. Our oldest, he's 20, is here to help with the younger siblings. People at my husband's work have refused to wear masks. I'm so angry.
