## Delta variant is spreading in California as COVID-19 battle enters an uncertain phase — “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-24/covid-19-delta-variant-spread-california-how-bad-is-it):

> The Delta variant of the coronavirus is beginning to spread in California, offering a preview of how the battle of the pandemic is going to change as officials move to protect a shrinking minority who remain at risk because they have not been vaccinated. There were only a tiny handful of cases of the Delta variant in the U.K. in late March, but that grew to about 25% of cases by early May. By mid-June, 95% of cases were tied to the Delta variant. The Delta variant is now the fourth most-often identified variant in California.

> Excerpt: 
> 
> > The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U.S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world.
> 
> > And vaccines available in the U.S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.
> 
> > “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”
> 
> > Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that walloped the nation three times in the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t been previously been infected with the coronavirus.
> 
> > This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated.
> 
> > Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”

## Delta COVID Variant Triples in California - The Santa Barbara Independent

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.com/2021/06/29/delta-covid-variant-triples-in-california/):

> June's leap in Delta variant cases in California - at 14.5 percent of surveillance sequencing compared to 4.7 percent in May - puts COVID vaccinations front and center again. Dr. Henning Ansorg, Santa Barbara County's health officer, agreed, adding that 323 cases in children were known nationwide out of 12 million second doses given: "This is an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people could experience it after vaccination." He added vaccines were safe and effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, an important consideration with the increase in the Delta variant. Fitzgibbons noted Los Angeles has been two to four weeks ahead of Santa Barbara when it came to COVID. "The majority of Delta cases around the U.S. happened in people who are unvaccinated," she said, "And we do know that the small number of fully vaccinated people who catch the Delta variant infection are very, very unlikely to develop severe disease, require hospitalization, or have their life threatened."

> So the percentage of delta amongst the infected tripled from 4.7% to 14.5%. That doesn't mean anything if the amount of actual cases stay constant. I'm assuming they left out the actual case count comparison in their article because it doesn't match their alarmist clickbait headline.
> 
> EDIT: 193 7 day rolling average on 06/29 vs 157 7 day rolling average on 05/29 in LA County. That's a 23% increase, not a tripling.

## Fiddleheads Cafe in Mendocino is closing after months of controversy

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Fiddleheads-Cafe-Mendocino-closed-shuttered-mask-16282595.php?IPID=SFGate-HP-CP-Spotlight):

> Among the conditions included in the month-to-month lease, along with a rent increase, were stipulations that there be "No further publicity related to the business, of any kind, regarding mask wearing or vaccinations, and business will comply with any orders, laws, or mandates of government," according to a copy of the extension contract Castleman provided to SFGATE. Castleman was also required to keep from making "Disparaging or harmful communications or actions or consequences of any kind" that could impact other businesses, the landlord and the local community, the contract reviewed by SFGATE said. Castleman's landlords stated they do not recall Castleman's offers for twice the amount of rent or to pay two years in advance. "To grant his extension, we wanted to ensure Mr. Castleman was serious about selling his business rather than political fanfare, since we had a vested interest for him to exit his business - therefore, we added conditions to remove polarizing signs and communications so as not to turn off prospective buyers. We consulted with realtors that confirmed if Castleman was serious about selling his business, he would remove the polarizing signage; but instead Castleman declined the extension, and prioritized his business below his ideology."

> >The building was recently sold, and the cafe's lease with the new owners — a couple from Marin — was canceled in June just days after the cafe made national headlines in late May for adding a $5 fee for those who ordered food from his cafe with masks on.
> 
> ...
> 
> >"We respect and are accepting of all our Tenants' political and personal beliefs. However, if a Tenant's behavior impacts the business of other Tenants (driving away customers to the building) or creates a potential liability (e.g. large fines the building owner is ultimately responsible for or conflict in the community that could translate into physical altercations), then it becomes a business decision as to whether or not to continue the Tenancy. ... Hours were spent discussing Chris Castleman with members of the Mendocino community and it became clear from the feedback that it was in our best interest for him to leave. Out of respect for Chris, we will not repeat the intense negative feedback we have heard from the community and strong advice that he needed to leave ASAP. 
> 
> >"During our evaluation, Chris Castleman created a false narrative that we ended his month-to-month lease due to a disagreement with his ideology. We received multiple messages — many threatening — from his supporters that expressed dismay we would not renew his lease based on a difference in ideology. This narrative is patently false. This is a business and since we will be losing money with the decision to end his lease, its just indicative of the magnitude to which Mr. Castleman's beliefs have interfered and added risk to the overall business. We have heard from people in the community that continue to steer clear of the building as a result of Mr Castleman, and some have expressed fear."

## Worried About J&J - Booster Shot Needed?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/oare1h/worried_about_jj_booster_shot_needed/):

> I've been reading more articles about how Canada, UK, Germany, France, and Spain are now administrating/recommending mixing vaccinations, specifically AstraZeneca followed by Phizer/Moderna shot. I've been worried about the J&J shot as of late, since the amount of information or data is extremely low or nonexistent, compared to the ample amount of information on the mRNA shots, specifically Phizer. I've also come across some articles that state US infectious disease experts who received the J&J shot are now following up with a shot of Phizer and are recommending following up with your doctors.

> The sheer volume of ignorant and straight up idiotic comments on the Facebook version of LA County DPH's post is just mind boggling.
> 
> Like, ffs, this is an ADVISORY. Public Health advises against eating fast food all the time, but that doesn't mean they're trying to force fast food restaurants to close. You do you, based on your tolerance for risk. That's all.

## L.A. County urges everyone to wear mask indoors as Delta variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-28/as-delta-variant-spreads-l-a-county-recommends-everyone-mask-indoors):

> With the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus continuing to spread statewide, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is recommending that all residents wear masks in public indoor spaces - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated for COVID-19. Despite the latest recommendation, L.A. County health officials noted that "Fully vaccinated people appear to be well protected from infections with Delta variants." Of the 123 people in L.A. County confirmed to have been infected with the Delta variant thus far, 110 were unvaccinated and three were partially vaccinated.

> This is muddled messaging all over again that conflicts with what we’re hearing from the CDC and the broader medical community. The “you can never be too cautious” line of reasoning just doesn’t hold for me when vaccines are so widely available and with such high uptake in the state.
