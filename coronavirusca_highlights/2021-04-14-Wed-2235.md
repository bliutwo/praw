## Only 30% of L.A. County men have received COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 44% of women

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-14/low-covid-19-vaccination-rates-among-men):

> While 44% of women in L.A. County have received at least one dose of a vaccine, only 30% of men have. The vaccine distribution is particularly low among Black and Latino men in L.A. County, with only 19% and 17%, respectively, having gotten one shot of the vaccine so far, according to county data. In general, men tend to be less cautious than women and more prone to risk, as evidenced by the high cost of insuring young men to drive cars, Carpiano said.

`/u/dak-sm` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/mr0vaj/only_30_of_la_county_men_have_received_covid19/):

> Men generally neglect their health because they are too manly to be bothered and going to a doctor is a sign of weakness.  From early days, they are acculturated to not show weakness or ask for help.  In short, men are stupid.
