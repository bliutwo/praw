## Gov. Newsom Sending a Team to Disney World for Theme Park Reopening Feedback

Summary of [original article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gov-newsom-sending-a-team-to-disney-world-for-theme-park-reopening-feedback):

> California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Monday that he was sending members of his staff to Walt Disney World to see firsthand how the theme park is operating amid the pandemic as the company is demanding Disneyland be allowed to reopen. Disney has pointed to the success of the destination since Disney World reopened in July with no known cases of COVID-19 linked to the park. The governor did not say the team would only be visiting Disney World; they may go to Universal Orlando, too, but Disney has been the most outspoken about allowing its SoCal theme park to reopen.

> A couple of updates to this article: 
> 
> 1. State officials already conducted a visit/tour of Disneyland (CA), back in late Sept/early October. The tour happened prior to the governor’s office issuance of guidelines that the Theme Parks Association quickly rejected before the guidelines could become official. 
> 
> 2. Apparently (unconfirmed), the California health officials who went to Florida to check out WDW have *already done so*, and were likely doing an “undercover secret shop” visit of the parks in Orlando to get a clearer picture of everyday COVID safety protocols from the company, rather than an elaborate presentation.
> 
> ETA: a few friends of mine who work/are furloughed from Disneyland confirmed that a second tour/visit from state officials will be happening this week

## Normalcy will return only with second generation of Covid-19 vaccine: Bill Gates

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/normalcy-will-return-only-with-second-generation-of-covid-19-vaccine-bill-gates/ar-BB19XPwf):

> Gates told NBC that normalcy can return "When we have, not the first generation of vaccines, but one that is super-effective". He said the second generation vaccine should also be widely available, adding only then "All the problems created by Covid-19 can be solved". The WHO chief scientist, said on Monday: "As you know, we have about 40 vaccine candidates now in some stage of clinical trials, and 10 of them are in the phase three trials, which are the late-stage clinical trials, which will tell us about both the efficacy and the safety. So, the best we could make a guess or predict, looking at when a trial started and when it is likely to have enough data to submit to the regulators, is [at] earliest from December of 2020 into the early part of 2021.".

## Californians shouldn't trick-or-treat this Halloween, state health officials say

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-13/california-halloween-trick-or-treat-state-health-officials-coronavirus):

> State health officials are advising Californians to skip trick-or-treating this Halloween, though their new guidelines, released Tuesday, stop short of prohibiting the activity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials are strongly discouraging trick-or-treating and suggested that some Halloween activities, such as costume contests and pumpkin carving, move online. Last month, Los Angeles County public health officials prohibited trick-or-treating; following blowback, they revised the guidance a day later to say the activity was "Not recommended." All Halloween gatherings with people outside of a household, including haunted houses, will be barred in Los Angeles County, regardless of the state's rules allowing gatherings of up to three households.

> I don’t see the issue with just buying kids a big bag of halloween candy and letting them go to town on it this year while watching some halloween movies dressed up in their costumes, it sucks that they can’t trick or treat but we can still make it a fun and memorable halloween with some creative alternatives

## Universal Studios Hollywood Has Laid Off More Than 2200 People

Summary of [original article](https://bleedingcool.com/pop-culture/universal-studios-hollywood-has-laid-off-more-than-2200-people/):

> There has been a lot of debate about what a theme park in a COVID-19 world looks like, and while some parks have opened, both Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood have both had to remain closed. According to Deadline, Universal Studios Hollywood has cut more than 1,300 jobs permanently and temporarily laid off 849 workers since July. So at least Universal isn't cutting health benefits for the people who had health benefits during a pandemic, so that's good, I suppose.

`/u/Latinboy714` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jato3n/universal_studios_hollywood_has_laid_off_more/):

> If everyone wears a mask, stops bitching, and complaining. We’ll control the virus within 2 months. 
> 
> But no, we have Karen’s complaining and making I unnecessary drama
