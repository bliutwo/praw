Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/LA-County-sees-surge-in-virus-cases-urges-16291079.php):

> The county averaged nearly 300 new cases a day over a seven-day period that ended Wednesday, representing an increase of 85% from the seven-day period that ended June 24. Santa Clara County dropped its death toll by nearly 23%. The county had been including in its COVID-19 death toll anyone who tested positive for the virus before or after they died, regardless of the listed cause of death. The change, which follows a similar move in Alameda County in early June, drops the overall number of COVID-19 fatalities in Santa Clara County to 1,698 people.

## Cost of fighting COVID in California: $12.3 billion

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/cost-covid-california/):

> Fighting COVID-19 in California has cost taxpayers at least $12.3 billion since the start of the pandemic. One of the biggest price tags was for state prisons, where 227 infected prisoners have died and combatting COVID-19 has cost nearly $1.6 billion. California's food banks have received about $230 million in state and federal cash grants as well as USDA boxed food deliveries.

> 
> Why not compare it to the GDP of California itself which is 3090 billion last year.

> Yes, it's legitimate. But always a good thing to be wary of these types of things, and do your research first.  Here's the LA county page that mentions them working with Healthvana for vaccine records:

> Excerpts: 
> 
> > Recent spikes in coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County and elsewhere in California underscore a pandemic divergence, in which the unvaccinated face growing danger, while the vaccinated are able to move back to regular activities without fear of getting sick.
> 
> > Some who have not been inoculated may have hoped that the dramatic decline in COVID-19 cases this spring and summer — which officials attribute to a robust vaccination campaign — would be enough to protect them without getting a shot. But with the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, infections are again on the rise — and communities with low vaccination rates are in the crosshairs.
> 
> > Los Angeles County reported more than 3,000 new coronavirus cases cumulatively over the last three days. It was the first time since early March that the county has reported three consecutive days with more than 1,000 new cases.
> 
> > . 
> 
> > Unvaccinated people may be playing an increasingly risky game of chance. The coronavirus case rate for California’s unvaccinated residents is eight times higher than it is for vaccinated residents: For every 100,000 unvaccinated residents, 4.9 per day become infected, while for every 100,000 vaccinated residents, 0.6 are infected.

## Vaccination percentages by county? I am looking for a map that shows vaccination percentages by county (not zip code.) Leaving on a trip very soon and want a visual of how careful to be at various stops. The state one I found only had total doses, not percentages. Thanks!

## California to require masks at school, a cautious decision that treats all students the same

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/california-to-require-masks-in-schools-despite-cdc-guidelines-theyre-not-needed-if-vaccinated):

> The new school year in California will start with students and teachers wearing masks, state officials announced Friday, staking out a cautious position on a day when new federal guidelines stressed the importance of fully reopening schools and recommended masks only for those who are not vaccinated. As part of a multilayered approach to limit the spread of COVID-19, those who are not vaccinated should wear masks indoors - and schools, health departments or states may continue to require masks on campus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In May, the CDC said that Americans in general don't have to be as cautious about masks and distancing outdoors and that fully vaccinated people don't need masks in most situations.

`/u/MachineGunTeacher` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ohx49m/california_to_require_masks_at_school_a_cautious/):

> I’m curious about when we won’t have to wear masks. I can tell you that teaching with a mask on makes it so much more difficult for language learners and those who struggle with hearing (which is a lot more than you’d think because of ear buds causing damage).

## L.A. County has more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases in a day, highest in months

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-10/la-county-1000-coronavirus-cases-day-highest-in-months):

> Los Angeles County reported more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day on Friday - the biggest such report in months. The last time L.A. County reported more than 1,000 new cases in a single day was due to a backlog of cases in late May. In early March, the county was routinely posting new coronavirus cases of more than 1,000 a day. With 1,060 new cases reported Friday, according to a preliminary Times tally, L.A. County was averaging 598 new cases a day over the past week, a significant increase from a month ago, when the county was reporting fewer than 200 new cases a day.

`/u/futureslave` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/oho60z/la_county_has_more_than_1000_new_coronavirus/):

> >Officials are attributing the rise in coronavirus cases to the virus’ spread among unvaccinated people in L.A. County.
> 
> >The test positivity rate has increased from the 1.5% reported last week to Friday’s rate of 2.4%.
> 
> >COVID-19 hospitalizations are also rising in L.A. County. The record low for COVID-19 hospitalizations was posted June 12, when 212 were in the hospital, a 97% decrease from the peak of the pandemic Jan. 5, when 8,098 people were in hospitals.
> 
> >But by Thursday, there were 336 people with COVID-19 in county hospitals.
> 
> >“With increased COVID-19 transmission among unvaccinated people, [the Department of] Public Health encourages those that are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination and not yet vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay,” county officials said in a statement. “It takes time before you are considered fully vaccinated. For all of the vaccines, you are only considered fully protected two weeks after all doses are complete. Vaccination is the best protection against this disease.”
> 
> For those unable to get vaccinated, we still wear our masks for you. For the others, we have no more words.
