## Federal judge orders COVID-19 testing at Bakersfield immigration detention facility

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-16/federal-judge-orders-covid-19-testing-at-bakersfield-immigration-detention-facility):

> A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered immediate testing of all detainees and staff at a Bakersfield immigration detention center where COVID-19 was spreading for weeks while officials refused to test for the virus. Lawyers for ICE and GEO reported to the court that a staff member who obtained a test outside of work was positive for the virus, the first of 14 who would eventually report positive tests taken on their own, MacLean said. The facility began testing in the first week of August, but the results of those tests have not yet been returned, MacLean said.

## New York corralled coronavirus, what’s California’s excuse for case surge? — Are Californians not taking the virus seriously enough?

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/new-york-corralled-coronavirus-whats-californias-excuse-for-case-surge):

> The trend lines are as stark as they are puzzling: Daily COVID-19 infections in New York have plunged by more than 90% from their mid-April peak, while California's new cases have soared tenfold during that time. On July 7, California's new daily cases had more than doubled in a month while New York was holding steady with about a tenth as many cases. Miller points to a preliminary study by the Scripps Research Institute that suggests the strain of the new coronavirus that took off in Europe and then New York spreads far more easily than the early strains in California from China.

`/u/Socrates_Burrito` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/iayjpo/new_york_corralled_coronavirus_whats_californias/):

> New York didn't corral shit. I hate this new narrative. They got hit so hard that almost everybody that was bound to die from coronavirus did die.
> 
> NY: 1691 deaths per million
> 
> CA: 284 deaths per million
> 
> CA's peak average daily deaths has been 142. Even if 142 Californians died every day for the next year and no NYers ever died again from COVID, CA would still be doing better than NY in deaths per million (1576 to 1691).
