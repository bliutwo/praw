## [Discussion] Governor Newsom's 07/02 Press Conference

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hk2xde/discussion_governor_newsoms_0702_press_conference/):

> Masks keep Californians healthy! Wear One! Renewed emphasis on the evidence pointing to decreased transmission rates with masks. Q4: PSAs are great, but we need fines and orders from state level for masks and distancing, not local level. Q5: what will be done for OC's past disregard for mask orders? Is the fiscal contingency going to work for a county that has grossly disregarded rules?

> I will open the discussion with the following:
> 
> Newsom is taking a conservative, evidence-based approach for shutting down certain sectors. Perhaps he feels pressured from the industries as shutting down gyms and churches without the "data" may upset many.
> 
> He's dodging some questions blatantly but I don't fault him. California is already so divided, it is difficult to willingly make yourself the "bad guys" and enforce masks with tickets. You risk further dividing your people. That's not the goal. We need to unify and work together.
> 
> I primarily live and operate in Central California. I'm glad Ventura beach shut down but hope that Santa Barbara and San Diego also close for the safety of everyone involved.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> On a lighter note, I'm glad that the Governor is being a human through all this. He jokingly welcomed names like the Governator and Snoop Dogg on the PSA lists. I think he's doing ok mentally although his belly has gotten a bit larger lately. Get some exercise and stay safe Governor!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hk39xl/is_there_a_way_to_anonymously_report_my_work_for/):

> I work in the parts department of a dealership in Southern California that has not shut down once during this whole pandemic. My work area has not been professionally sanitized once and we now have 5 positive tests that they are trying to keep quiet. Is there a website or number to report my job to maybe get someone to crack down on some regulations?
