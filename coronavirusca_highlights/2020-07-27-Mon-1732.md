## LA Health Department Finally shut down my moms employer

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hywv1f/la_health_department_finally_shut_down_my_moms/):

> I don't know if this is the correct place to post this or if LA County has a specific page but my mom works for a food processing plant lets just say they provide food for the Golden Arches the most recognized fast food chain in the world. The day my mother called out July 13, 47 other employees called out sick for the first time due to covid. Well they make all the food for this fast food chain in this state and most of Western U.S. so if they can't produce food for them they might have to close locations depending how long this shut down last.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hz1gi4/covid_update_july_27_2020_a_new_cognitive_test/):

Case doubling days didn't go down, whereas in OC they dropped by 4 days to 24 days, and in SD, they went from 38 days to 27 days. Decrease in case doubling days from 38 days to 27 days.

## [Discussion] Pods don't work: Parents' attempts will fail sooner or later

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hz24rn/discussion_pods_dont_work_parents_attempts_will/):

> Supposedly rules were strict, organizers and parents and kids were supposed to socially distance as much as possible, etc. I've heard by now several such stories of parents wanting to enter pods and not following the rules they're supposed to abide by. Either one of the parents works in a high-risk workplace, or they don't follow the same rules and mingle with others, or they have a pod with a set of grandparents at risk and rightfully don't want to expand it.

`/u/jah-roole` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hz24rn/discussion_pods_dont_work_parents_attempts_will/):

> Yeah, cuz just because you're rich doesn't make you any less of a moron.  I don't mean to be harsh but if I sent my kid, which I wouldn't, to one of those and then found out that said morons didn't obey the agreed upon rules, I'm showing up at your house and bitch slapping fools.
