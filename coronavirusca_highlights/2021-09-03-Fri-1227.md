## California county declares Covid misinformation a public health crisis [San Diego County]

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/california-san-diego-covid-misinformation-b1912610.html):

> A California county has become the first in the US to declare Covid-19 misinformation a public health crisis. The successful resolution states "Using health misinformation is causing a public health crisis" in the area. "At a pivotal time in our history, with a FDA-approved vaccine available to all San Diegans free of charge and booster shots recommended later this year, health misinformation now presents a greater threat to public health than a variant of Covid-19," the introduction letter to the proposal read. Hesitancy about taking the vaccine "Stands in the way of the county moving beyond the Covid-19 pandemic", the letter continued.

> I would think it is both health misinformation *and* disinformation (purposely wrong information).
> And I wonder how much of this is being driven by China and Russia. They have an incentive to cause chaos, and, if thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing, boy are they succeeding.

## I'm a California teacher, and my school's lacking COVID-19 protocols show how we're being set up to fail - thereliablenews

Summary of [original article](https://thereliablenews.com/news/tech/im-a-california-teacher-and-my-schools-lacking-covid-19-protocols-show-how-were-being-set-up-to-fail/):

> Unlike other school districts in my area, including my son's, neither the teachers in my school nor our students have been tested for COVID-19 - and not once during those two days were COVID-19 protocols mentioned. The expectations placed on teachers set us up to fail. I became one of "Those" teachers who came to school a few minutes before class began, and left school when the bell rang.

> I work at an elementary in the kitchen. So in class theyâ€™re required to wear masks, but suddenly it disappears at lunchtime. Multiple classes crowd into the very tiny cafeteria, elbow to elbow, and across. They remove their mask, eat and go about their day. Well when it comes to a positive test, they only inform the class and THAT class gets quarantined but not anyone else, even if they sit with another student from another class.

> I do not get their logic.

> Edit : not sure why someone reported me to Reddit crisis, Iâ€™m not going through anything but frustration over this pandemic & the protocols being followed. Nothing in my original comment was concerning about MYSELF. Thanks anyways though

## California sees progress in coronavirus fight compared with Texas, Florida, other states

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-01/california-covid-cases-vs-texas-florida-other-states):

> The test positivity rate, public health officials say, is a useful measure of coronavirus spread. Because the raw number of cases can vary depending on how much testing is going on - and testing has ramped up dramatically since California schools reopened - a stable or declining positivity rate can demonstrate slowing transmission. Over the seven-day period ending Tuesday evening, California reported an average of 13,908 new coronavirus cases per day, according to data compiled by The Times. As of June 15, when California reopened its economy and lifted virtually all coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses and public spaces, the state was recording fewer than 900 total cases per day, on average.

> Vote.  Don't let some culture warrior meathead Republican turn California into Florida or Texas.
