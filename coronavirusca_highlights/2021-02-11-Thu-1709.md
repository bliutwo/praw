> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

> I'm a healthcare worker who went to one of these clinics run by the writer, Mangia, and brought my paperwork with me to show as proof as the webiste indicated would be required when I booked my appointment but was never asked. When I scheduled my appointment online, I didn't have to enter my license number or anything either. So, maybe he needs to review his own process.

> This is going to happen.  They've gotten rid of bottlenecks and streamlined the process so now they're giving vaccines faster than they can be made.
> 
> This is actually a good thing in terms of distribution.  It's one less thing holding us back. If distribution centers are waiting on the factories, it means there's no delays happening along the way.  So when the factories can start picking up the pace, distribution sites will be able to give more vaccines.

## California now has the most COVID-19 deaths, though fewer per capita than most states

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-10/california-now-has-the-most-covid-19-deaths-but-fewer-per-capita-than-most-states):

> California now has more COVID-19 deaths than any other state, a distinction reflecting both its large population and the ravages of a winter coronavirus wave that has only recently begun to recede. To further put California's number in perspective, the state is closer to Wyoming, which has seen 107 deaths per 100,000 residents, than it is to New York, at 229, or New Jersey, which has the highest rate in the nation at 248. Promising news emerged on that front over the last week as California reported an average of 12,278 new cases per day - a 47% decrease from two weeks ago, Times data show.

`/u/BlankVerse` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lhsme0/california_now_has_the_most_covid19_deaths_though/):

> Every other news publication is going "OMG! California has more deaths than New York" (because sensationalistic disaster journalism sells). But California is the most populous state, so it should only be news when California  is NOT the top in something population related. 
> 
> I'm glad at least the LA Times has put the news in perspective.

## First cases of South African coronavirus strain found in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/02/11/first-cases-of-south-african-coronavirus-strain-found-in-california/):

> California's first cases of the South African coronavirus variant have been confirmed in the Bay Area, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. While currently available vaccines appear to still be effective against most of the coronavirus variants that have been identified to this point, the strain fueling a resurgence of COVID-19 in South Africa was not slowed down by one therapeutic - an experimental vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University - that officials had been counting on to protect its frontline healthcare workers, prompting the government to shelve plans for an inoculation campaign that would have begun this month. California has also confirmed 159 identifiable cases of the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom, designated as B.1.

`/u/chef_dewhite` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lhpx3m/first_cases_of_south_african_coronavirus_strain/):

> Okay before we all go down this dark hole "this is the next surge, this pandemic will never end."  I have seen very little data or evidence that the SA Variant is more transmissible. If you know otherwise please share that data. The concerning parts of the variant are vaccines are less effective, current therapeutics don't work as well and its mutated enough you can get reinfected.  So yes we need be vigilant, and can't let it get foothold.  But some cases appearing does not automatically mean it is gonna spread and be the dominant strain in the region.  Still wear masks, still social distance, that is all we can and should be doing.

## Why all the world's Coronavirus would fit in a can of soda

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210210-why-the-entire-coronavirus-would-fit-in-a-can-of-coca-cola):

> The amount of virus that each of the people currently infected will carry around with them depends on how long ago they were infected. The final thing we need to know is the number of virus particles people harbour at any point during their infection. Since we know roughly how viral load changes over time, it's enough to have an estimate of the peak viral load. An unpublished study took data on the number of virus particles per gram of a range of different tissues in infected monkeys and scaled up the size of tissue to be representative of humans.

## California left clinics off vaccine list, so low-income patients are underserved

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/02/california-vaccine-clinics-low-income-patients/):

> California's community health clinics had not been invited by the state to enroll as vaccine providers yet, even though the first doses were expected to arrive in Los Angeles in less than a month. Last week, the California Primary Care Association, which represents community health centers, sent a sharply-worded, five-page letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office, asking that community clinics be prioritized and included in administering the vaccine. California's often-chaotic vaccine rollout has been plagued by multiple shortcomings including federal supply shortages, shifting vaccine eligibility guidelines for residents and widespread issues with pharmacies delivering doses to long-term care facilities.

`/u/youm3ddlingkids` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/lh4ac0/california_left_clinics_off_vaccine_list_so/):

> Did these clinics have proper storage for the vaccine? They may not have the resources to store the vaccine or store enough of it to make shipping there worth it. With vaccine availability low, those kind of decisions have to be considered.
