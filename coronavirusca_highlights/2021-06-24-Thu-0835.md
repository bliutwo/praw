## California's COVID-19 vaccinations rise as U.S. struggles. Does the lottery deserve credit?

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-23/did-newsoms-california-covid-vaccine-lottery-boost-doses):

> "You saw across the country a decline in [the] total number of people getting vaccinated. There were efforts in states large and small to stem that by doing incentives, cash prizes. California was no different," Newsom said last week. The Times analyzed vaccination data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the average number of doses administered daily by California during the weeks of May 27 to June 2 and June 3 through June 9, then calculated the percentage change. California administered an average of 121,000 doses each day the first week, and about 161,000 doses daily the following week - a 33% increase.

## LAPD examines whether it could make COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for cops

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-22/police-commission-requests-report-on-legality-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-lapd):

> The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday requested the LAPD report back to it on the possibility and legality of a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for officers and the work assignments of its unvaccinated personnel - who represent nearly half the department. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said top LAPD commanders and police union officials are continuing to urge vaccination among officers and are committed to following city personnel guidelines and state and federal workplace guidelines related to COVID-19. The board of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file officers, said it would generally oppose a vaccine mandate, but will continue to urge officers to get vaccinated and talk to their doctors about any concerns they have.
