> This yoga studio is in my town.  I remember when the lockdown first started their windows were plastered with anti-Gavin Newsom posters.  Haven't been by since, but was unsurprised to see them featured on KRON4 [as well as on](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/j9qxlb/hot_yoga_studio_not_following_covid_guidelines/) /r/bayarea today.  
> 
> Of all activities, I think hot yoga in a crowded studio would be one of the most risky fitness activity with so much fluids and heavy breathing happening indoors.  I have to hot yoga and it's like being in a petri dish even without a pandemic going on.

> I saw this a few minutes ago. People are going to flip if we go back into purple. I teach in the county and o am preparing myself either way. I can’t imagine what the reaction will be from the business community either. A part of me thinks if people would just comply with the restrictions in the first place, we wouldn’t be in this mess. I also think parents are starting to see that the return to school won’t be “normal” at all. I know of several parents (of my students) who would rather just keep them online instead of the mess that is hybrid.

> Fuck those people...and fuck whoever lets them in the store. I was in Target and saw someone one with no mask walk by. I ask a staff why they just let them go, and they said that they are not allowed to ask them to leave.
