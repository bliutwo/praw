## State puts brakes on Marin’s plans to resume reopening

Summary of [original article](https://www.marinij.com/2020/09/08/state-puts-brakes-on-marins-plans-to-resume-reopening/):

> Businesses hoping to advance the reopening process in Marin will have to wait until Friday to learn whether state health officials consider it safe to do so. Dr. Matt Willis, Marin County's public health officer, said state health officials assured him as late as Sunday that the county was on a trajectory to move from "Tier 1" - the state's most restrictive COVID-19 status - to "Tier 2," which would have allowed a number of businesses to resume indoor activities on a limited basis. Counties assigned to tier 2 must maintain a new case rate between four to seven positive cases per day per 100,000 people and a testing positivity rate between 5-8%. Willis said the state made two late changes in the way it analyzes data, which he suspects may have resulted in its decision on Monday to keep Marin in tier 1.

> The state won’t even share how they are analyzing the data. This is so stupid.

> Please don't post media that is overly meant to stir up hate or fear. No Political Posts - While a lot of covidiots are idiots because of politics and it's okay to expose those, posts should not be ONLY political in nature. Because Reddit is obsessed with him, no pro or anti-Trump posts.

## Young People Are Missing Out on Important Life Events Due to COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27202/20200907/young-people-events-covid-19.htm):

> Rites of passage create a transformative experience for people and mark a change as special as people step out of ordinary life. Missing out on these rites of passage means that young people are also missing out on a transition phase into adulthood. As young people miss out on their rites of passage, there becomes a decline in these critical life events.

> We are all missing out on life events. That's what making a sacrifice for your fellow man is.
