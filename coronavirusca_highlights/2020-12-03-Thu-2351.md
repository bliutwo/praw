## California Sheriff Who Refused to Enforce Mask Order Gets COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sacramento-county-sheriff-scott-jones-gets-covid-19):

> The Sacramento Bee reports that Jones was infected by a co-worker and developed only mild symptoms. His office said it has been "Following all recommended personal safety protocols"-but Jones has not used his authority to make sure the public is doing the same. When the state imposed a mask mandate, Jones said his officers would not be enforcing it, referring to potential violations as "Minor." He also announced last month that he would not make sure people were abiding by Gov. Gavin Newsom's curfew as cases began surging.

## Gavin Newsom announces new stay-at-home order that could take effect in some regions this week

Summary of [original article](https://amp.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247546405.html):

> The new order will apply in regions where available intensive care unit capacity drops below 15%, according to the Newsom administration. In regions where intensive care unit capacity falls below the threshold, the new stay-at-home order will bar nonessential gatherings and require people to stay at home as much as possible to avoid transmitting the virus. The new order represents a return for many Californians to the isolation they experienced in March, when California was the first state to impose a stay-at-home order.

> It's like Newsom is trying to do as little as possible while appearing to be doing something. There is lag from infection to hospitalization, from hospitalization to ICU, and from ICU to death. Using ICU capacity to trigger stay-at-home is only one step better than using morgue capacity to trigger stay-at-home. It's almost as bad as saying that we won't do anything until people are dying faster than we can bury them.

## How bad do you think this needs to get before we see everything shut down like the way it did in March?

> Complete 100% occupancy of acute hospital care facilities including ICUs with Covid-19 patients. When they start rationing care and implementing crisis standards of care it’s going to be really bad. That and when they stop all elective surgeries. 
> 
> 
> That’s when you’ll see a complete and total shutdown of California economy. I hope it doesn’t end up that way.

## Thirteen percent of California farmworkers tested positive for Covid-19 compared with 3 percent of Californians overall, said a recent study.

Summary of [original article](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2020/12/02/salinas-valley-farmworkers-study-finds-13-positive-covid-19/3786093001/):

> The report included COVID-19 testing of 1,091 agricultural workers in the Salinas Valley. Eskenazi pointed to other data points from the study - about half of participating farmworkers have struggled to pay their bills during the pandemic, and more than half reported low or very low food security - as she highlighted the need for financial support and other supportive services for workers exposed to or diagnosed with the virus. About half of participating farmworkers said they were extremely likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the UC Berkeley report, while about 20% said they were unsure and 11% said they were either unlikely or very unlikely to do so.1 in 5 participants had COVID-19 antibodiesAs part of the study, UC Berkeley researchers and medical professionals from the Salinas health center interviewed people who worked in agriculture, were age 18 or older, spoke English or Spanish, were not pregnant, were getting tested for COVID-19, and had not tested positive for the virus in the previous two weeks.

> I’m getting kind of annoyed that the surprise stay at home order hasn’t been announced yet. Either say it or don’t, don’t leave everyone in limbo wondering for a week.

## Newsom to order new limits on California businesses and activities as COVID-19 soars

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-03/newsom-weighs-shutdown-california-covid-19-cases-soar-december):

> Although current state projections show only Southern California and Central Valley counties will have to immediately put in place the new rules, data released by the Newsom administration earlier this week show almost all of the state could soon reach the new threshold - with 85% or more of ICU beds filled. Any reopening of closed services and activities will be based on four-week projections of a region's ICU capacity - suggesting the broad new restrictions could easily last through the end of the year in some communities. The new restrictions appear to remove the distinction between essential and nonessential retail - a 20% cap on capacity at all stores is likely to significantly reduce capacity at essential retailers, including supermarkets and drug stores.

`/u/badatwinning` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/k65d0c/newsom_to_order_new_limits_on_california/):

> I feel the order only hits a couple of business types and the rest will carry on as usual. And if that's the case, do we really need to close salons/barbers (and probably others I didn't see mentioned).
> 
> Just seems like they get to take the financial heat for everyone else who's spreading it. I work in a government office that currently has no urgent work; I'm sure we'll stay open and everyone will continue to sit at their desks maskless or walk around with them falling off their faces, as we report more and more cases in our building (I get multiple emails a week telling of of new cases). In my county we have many restaurants that shouldn't have indoor dining, but refuse to comply, and many more will keep outdoor dining open with this order. I don't know...it's just a shame that we'll shut down 10% of activity and hurt those people because the rest of the city will still act the same.
