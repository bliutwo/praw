## Delta variant is spreading in California as COVID-19 battle enters an uncertain phase — “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-24/covid-19-delta-variant-spread-california-how-bad-is-it):

> The Delta variant of the coronavirus is beginning to spread in California, offering a preview of how the battle of the pandemic is going to change as officials move to protect a shrinking minority who remain at risk because they have not been vaccinated. There were only a tiny handful of cases of the Delta variant in the U.K. in late March, but that grew to about 25% of cases by early May. By mid-June, 95% of cases were tied to the Delta variant. The Delta variant is now the fourth most-often identified variant in California.

> Excerpt: 
> 
> > The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U.S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world.
> 
> > And vaccines available in the U.S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.
> 
> > “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”
> 
> > Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that walloped the nation three times in the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t been previously been infected with the coronavirus.
> 
> > This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated.
> 
> > Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”

> People in my department (state) are on a task force to call unvaccinated people to ask them if they can do something to help them get vaccinated, or send them materials to help them understand why the vaccines are safe and a good idea.  Every state agency contributes dozens of employees to this task force.  They call each person 4 times.  This is a massive undertaking, involving 
>  tens of thousands of man hours a week.  I don't know what else the state can do, beyond offering prizes for getting the vaccine, making travel to and from free, and calling people to offer assistance and encouragement to sign up.  
> 
> Increasingly, the people  who aren't vaccinated, really don't want to be.  We're going to have to deal with that fact.  It's not just that the state DIDN'T do enough.

## Wrong name on the QR code. No one to help. How screwed am I?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/o7b4zv/wrong_name_on_the_qr_code_no_one_to_help_how/):

> I tried again the next day and it went through but I was horrified to discover that somehow, the vaccine was put into the CAIR2 database under my birth name even though when I put my name into the website, it's under my current name. I've been with Kaiser even before my name change, but they had all the legal documents. I have copies of my court order from my name change and that's what I assume I'm gonna have to carry around because the name on all my stuff doesn't match the QR code.
