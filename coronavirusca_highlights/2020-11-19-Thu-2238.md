## California to impose ‘limited’ stay-at-home order, curfew in some counties

Summary of [original article](https://fox40.com/news/coronavirus/sources-california-to-impose-limited-stay-at-home-order-curfew-in-some-counties/):

> The order affects dozens of counties and will include a curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The curfew will begin Saturday, Nov. 21 at 10 p.m. and remain in place for one month. Ninety-four percent of Californians, more than 37 million people, live in the 41 purple tier counties. "This is the same as the March Stay at Home Order, but applied only between 10 PM and 5 AM and only in purple tier counties that are seeing the highest rates of positive cases and hospitalizations," a statement from the governor's office read. "Even our everyday activities become higher risk," California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said at Thursday's news conference.

## Ski resorts are still opening - with or without COVID guidance from California

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/lake-tahoe-ski-resorts-open-covid-california-15737856.php):

> "The state is working collaboratively with local health departments and ski industry leaders on guidance for ski resorts on how they can operate with reduced risk," said Ali Bay, spokesperson for California Department of Public Health. Ever since, California ski areas have been engaged in a nationwide conversation with officials from other ski areas from Colorado to New England about the safest ways to operate with COVID. Without ski-specific guidance, Reitzell said the industry has looked to the more general category of "Outdoor recreation," which applies to campgrounds, RV parks and playgrounds. Dr. George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at UCSF, says the points of concern for COVID transmission are the places where people will be gathering - lining up for the chairlift and riding the chairlift to the top of the ski runs, at ski schools and rental shops and of course, après - which is the skiing code word for heading to the bar.

> It'll be interesting to see if Newsom will give ski resorts the winery treatment in light of his increasing restrictions and enforcing a curfew in purple counties.
> 
> >On Monday, the California Department of Public Health told SFGATE in an emailed statement that they are “constantly reviewing science, data and evidence and continually evaluating and updating guidance.” The department will update its guidelines once information specific to ski resorts is available. In the meantime, the department stated that “ski resorts are not permitted to operate.”
