## Bodies pile up, patient care falters as covid-19 devastates LA County hospitals

Summary of [original article](https://triblive.com/news/world/bodies-pile-up-patient-care-falters-as-covid-19-devastates-la-county-hospitals/):

> Dr. Christina Ghaly, the L.A. County health services director, said Wednesday, "There have been some unfortunate outcomes from patients in hospitals and ambulances across the county who couldn't be offloaded into an emergency department in a timely manner." A patient might require a BiPap machine, and there may be only one left, just surrendered by a patient who died, Byington said. At its peak in mid-December, L.A. County was averaging a net daily increase of 44 ICU patients for covid-19; by Tuesday, L.A. County was averaging a net additional 35 ICU patients every day over the past week.

> Well hopefully the partygoers of tonight don't get seriously hurt or OD or anything because they might actually die because of ICU wait times.  Maybe some will take this more seriously when their friend or partner dies from an otherwise preventable death on normal days.
