## Arizona surpasses California as state with the worst coronavirus infection rate

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-01-22/arizona-coronavirus-surge):

> This state of 7.2 million now has the worst coronavirus infection rate in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LaBaer, whose center runs test sites across the state, estimated that "Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 people in Arizona currently have an active case of the virus." Last month, the chief medical officers of eight of the state's largest hospitals wrote a letter to Gov. Doug Ducey and Arizona Department of Health Services Director Cara Christ asking for curfews and an end to indoor dining and group sports.

## 10,000 Riverside County coronavirus vaccination appointments fill up in 32 minutes — again

Summary of [original article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/01/23/10000-riverside-county-coronavirus-vaccination-appointments-fill-up-in-32-minutes-again/amp/?__twitter_impression=true):

> Another 10,000 appointments to get vaccinated against COVID-19 at Riverside County clinics filled up within 32 minutes Saturday, Jan. 23. County officials plan to make more appointments available in the middle of next week and more each week afterward, once the county knows how many doses of the coronavirus vaccine it will receive for the coming week, county spokeswoman Brooke Federico said Saturday. Thirty-two minutes is also the time it took for the last round of appointments - 3,900 appointments that opened at noon Thursday, Jan. 21 - to fill up.
