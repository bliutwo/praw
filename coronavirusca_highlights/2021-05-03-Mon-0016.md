## COVID: California’s coronavirus hospitalizations hit all-time low. Some Bay Area hospitals are treating just a few COVID-19 patients

Summary of [original article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/01/covid-californias-coronavirus-hospitalizations-hit-all-time-low/):

> Coronavirus hospitalizations in California have dropped to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, fueled by a surge in vaccinations and one of the lowest case rates in the country. Across the 10-county Bay Area, there were just 360 people hospitalized with COVID-19, fewer than at any time of the pandemic except for a few days last June when hospitalizations briefly dropped to the low 350s. One day last week, not a single person with the coronavirus came through the Stanford Hospital emergency department. Unlike in the past, when dips in hospitalizations came with the real threat of a surge just around the corner, this decline feels more stable.

> Fun stat from the article: 40% of people statewide are fully vaccinated already. That's so heartening to hear! Just got my second dose yesterday, thankfully access has been pretty easy in my area.

## California's secret weapon in COVID-19 success: We are not skeptical about the vaccine — Federal data indicate only about 11% of Californians are estimated to be vaccine hesitant, a lower rate than all but four states: Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut and Hawaii.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-01/minimal-vaccine-hesitancy-fuels-californias-covid-recovery):

> The share of those counties' populations estimated to be vaccine hesitant - meaning they either would probably not or definitely not receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available - ranged from 14% to 16%. By comparison, the rates in the least hesitant of California's 58 counties - San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Contra Costa, Orange and Alameda - were between 7% and 9%, federal estimates show. Though officials caution against reading too much into small geographical differences, the estimated hesitancy lists do line up neatly - though not entirely - with county-level vaccine coverage in California. Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, director of the medical ethics program at UC Irvine and a member of the vaccine task force in Orange County, said it's key to recognize "That the population in California is not homogenous - there are cultural, ethnic, moral, religious and medical differences between various individuals" and to hone "a public health strategy that thinks through that diversity."

> 11% is still high but I would not be surprised if it was actually more and some hesitant groups were not polled.

## New COVID outbreaks are walloping Oregon and Washington. Should the Bay Area be worried?

`/u/10390` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/n2o27s/new_covid_outbreaks_are_walloping_oregon_and/):

> Punchline:  
> 
> “In terms of risk, I do not think the fact that Oregon is contiguous with California puts California at an appreciably greater risk. There are so many people from other states coming into California — and so many Californians traveling to other states — that our risk comes from everywhere...While I am ecstatic with how well California is currently doing, I remain concerned that things could still turn in the wrong direction fairly quickly.”

## San Francisco Bars to Reopen Indoors May 7, But Patrons Must Be Seated

Summary of [original article](https://sfist.com/2021/04/30/san-francisco-bars-to-reopen-indoors/):

> San Francisco is expected to enter the "Yellow" tier next week for the first time since October, and the city is planning to lift more public health restrictions on businesses - most notably on bars. Dr. Susan Philip, San Francisco's acting health officer, said late Thursday that the city is planning to allow bars to open without food service indoors next Friday, May 7, at 25% capacity. For several weeks now, bars and restaurants have been allowed to seat people outdoors for drinks without the food requirement, but now the city's bars will get to open indoors - some for the first time since March 2020.
