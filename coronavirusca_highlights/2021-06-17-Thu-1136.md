> Everywhere I went today still required a mask (24 hour fitness, Target, chipotle, Burlington and Ross although I found out as I was leaving the gym that the rules were changed during my workout and you didn’t need one if vaccinated). I think people are just used to wearing masks now, you gotta let that shit fade out. You can’t expect everything to go back to normal overnight.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/06/15/coronavirus-tracker-california-reported-no-new-deaths-on-june-13-for-the-first-time-since-march-2020/):

> In California, 348 new cases of the coronavirus were reported Sunday, June 13, according to end-of-day totals on public health websites, bringing the total number of cases so far to 3,773,678. For the first time since March of 2020, there were no new deaths reported statewide Sunday, for a total of 62,884 people who have died from COVID-19. NOTICE: As COVID-19 cases continue to decline in California and the state reopens for business, the newspaper's daily COVID-19 tracker will be changing, too.

`/u/cantquitreddit` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/o0k67d/california_reported_no_new_covid19_deaths_on_june/):

> Death rate is about to start falling sharply.  With 900 cases a day we should really only be seeing an average death rate of about 5 cases per day.  The backlogs have mostly been cleared out so pretty soon we'll drop to about that level.

> It’s not just awareness.   It’s 18 months of habit that’s hard to break and it’s also an honor system.  IMHO the very people who would not get vaxxed are the same ones who’d lie about it.  I don’t trust anyone.  100% vaxxed and still wearing two masks.  Overly cautious by some standards but let’s see where things pan out.  Masking has worked well for me these past months no need to change now.
