> The Office of Emergency Services is using state hospitalization data to anticipate how many people may die in coming weeks. Newsom said the state was on pace to exceed his goal of giving out roughly 1.5 million doses by Friday. California - the nation's most populous state with nearly 40 million residents - has averaged more than 41,000 new coronavirus cases each day for the past two weeks, dwarfing earlier outbreaks.

> Ok I’m so close to vaccine Nirvana (aka going home after work to be alone in my room without wondering if I’m risking my life or my parents n fam) but it’s taking too ducking long!! If people like this give me the illness after me going right round the bend mentally for a year I’m going file a complaint I guess

## Why is California doing so badly?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kynvuq/why_is_california_doing_so_badly/):

> Literally everyone is wearing a mask OUTSIDE let alone inside closed areas. Who the fuck is catching covid under these circumstances? I dont get why california is doing so much worse than any other state.

`/u/Maschinenfabrik` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kynvuq/why_is_california_doing_so_badly/):

> I think a lot of people just meet their friends and family at home. One covid case then infects the rest of their households, which increases the numbers. You don’t see the people meeting their friends or families inside, but that’s where a lot of transmission is happening. Work is another factor.

## California has 2 million unused doses of vaccine even as demand soars. Here's why

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-has-2-million-unused-doses-of-vaccine-15875846.php):

> The disconnect between the county's request and the state's response underscores the largest and most mystifying problem in California's badly fumbled immunization rollout: How can California simultaneously have not enough vaccine to meet demand while so many doses remain unused? California has one of the lowest rates of vaccine administration in the country, with only a third of the 3 million doses delivered to the state actually being given so far - leaving 2 million doses apparently stored in freezers and awaiting recipients. Given the inconsistent vaccine supply coming from the federal government, some providers may also hold onto some doses longer to make sure people who have received their first dose can get a second one of the same type of vaccine.

> Kaiser seems to be doing a good job of using up their allocation.  It is disappointing that major health systems like the VA and PAMF/Sutter haven't (or won't) submit their data for the dashboard.

> This is five alarm fire bad. About to become the top news story of the day. I know our vaccine rollout was bad but this just completely deflated any progress we thought we’d be able to achieve over the next month. 
> 
> I don’t think California can even meet it’s newly declared goal of vaccinating all people 65+ given this information.
