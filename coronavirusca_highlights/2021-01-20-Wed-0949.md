## Another COVID-19 Variant Linked To Rising Cases In California

Summary of [original article](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/another-covid19-variant-linked-to-rising-cases-in-california/):

> California has warned that another variant of COVID-19 is ripping through parts of the state. The 452R variant that's recently been detected in California also features mutations that affect the spike protein, hence some of the concerns. "This variant carries three mutations, including L452R, in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and enter cells, and is the target of the two vaccines that are currently available in the United States," explained Dr Charles Chiu, virologist and professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF. Preliminary studies of the other recently identified variants, such as the UK variant and the South African variant.

## 2 O.C. high schools start playing football games, violating state health guidelines

Summary of [original article](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/2-o-c-high-schools-start-playing-football-games-violating-state-health-guidelines/amp/):

> Despite CIF and California Department of Public Health guidelines barring high school sports competitions because of the coronavirus pandemic, several football games involving high school teams were played over the weekend in Southern California. The Southern Section has taken the stand that the decision to allow athletic teams to resume is an "Individual school/district/private school decision" following the guidelines developed by the state and local health authorities. The CIF has said no games would be played until the governor and state public health guidelines allowed for them, which could lead to sanctions against member schools in violation.

> Cut off all of their State's funding, immediately. Fire all the people involved and take away their pension (tough but possibly).
> 
> Teachers unions are crying out loud for COVID-19 relief funding and they did this?
