## California has only administered a small fraction of its allocated vaccine doses

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/California-vaccine-COVID-numbers-dose-pace-Newsom-15836931.php):

> By using a combination of state data, federal data and public comments from elected officials, Bloomberg created a table that shows which states are using the highest - and lowest - percentages of their allocated doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The slow rollout has prompted finger-pointing, with President-elect Joe Biden blaming officials in the outgoing Trump Administration, while the Trump administration has blamed the states. Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of Brown University School of Public Health, has argued more blame rests with the federal government, stating on Twitter, "The worst part is no real planning on what happens when vaccines arrive in states. No plan, no money, just hope that states will figure this out."

## In the U.S. alone, more than 40% of Americans have reported postponing medical care due to Covid-19.

Summary of [original article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/30/stopping-syndemic-covid-19-plus-other-debilitating-deadly-diseases/):

> As the pandemic rips across the world, taking lives and devouring health resources and economies, it is also creating a void in which other debilitating and deadly diseases are left undiagnosed and untreated. To address these unmet needs and meet the syndemic head on, we need to reimagine our approach to health care. More broadly, the global health community needs to collectively support health systems in low- and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and other streams of the syndemic.

## San Francisco extends stay-at-home order and travel quarantine indefinitely

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/health/sf-extends-stay-at-home-order-indefinitely/9229826/):

> San Francisco is extending its stay-at-home order and coronavirus travel quarantine rules indefinitely, the city announced Thursday. The state may have allowed San Francisco and other Bay Area counties to exit the regional stay-at-home order as early as Jan. 8 if intensive care capacity improved, but the city isn't waiting for the state's direction it seems. Now, for San Francisco there's no set expiration date for the orders, nor its travel quarantine rules.

## Doctors, nurses 'can't take much more' amid Covid-19 surge in Southern California

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctors-nurses-can-t-take-much-more-amid-covid-19-n1252582):

> An implacable surge of Covid-19 cases has overwhelmed Southern California hospitals and intensive care units for most of December after public health officials warned for weeks that people should refrain from gathering with those outside their households over the holidays. When a patient's heart stops, a team of doctors and nurses suit up in protective equipment before they enter the room. Cedars-Sinai Health System, arguably the best-known hospital in Los Angeles, issued a "Crisis alert" Wednesday, imploring its patients not to gather for New Year's Eve."We know these recommendations are challenging, but it's important to remember the actions you take in the next few days can help protect you, your family and your loved ones - and those fighting for their lives in our hospital beds right now," the hospital said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-31/l-a-county-hospital-hit-breaking-point-no-one-would-believe-this-is-in-the-united-states):

> Dr. Christina Ghaly, the L.A. County health services director, said Wednesday, "There have been some unfortunate outcomes from patients in hospitals and ambulances across the county who couldn't be offloaded into an emergency department in a timely manner."

County was averaging a net daily increase of 44 ICU patients for COVID-19; by Tuesday, L.A. County was averaging a net additional 35 ICU patients every day over the past week.
