## Video: Data analyst believes SF's biggest COVID-19 mistakes were to re-open indoor dining, fail to notice its effects and act

Summary of [original article](https://missionlocal.org/2021/01/video-data-analyst-gives-his-take-on-where-sf-erred-in-october-as-covid-19-cases-began-to-increase/):

> Check out this video from the Phoenix Data Project to understand how San Francisco's decisions regarding the pandemic has impacted cases numbers. This data reveals that although San Francisco was doing relatively well controlling the pandemic, when indoor dining opened and cases numbers increased, SF made it's big mistake. The video recommends San Francisco fix inadequate metrics to avoid future surges.

## 'Everywhere you look, people are infected': Covid's toll on California Latinos

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/11/covid-california-latino-cases-inequality):

> "We should have learned, or we should have known," said Sanchez, an organizer with the labor union Unite Here Local 11, which represents workers at hotels, restaurants, convention centers, airports and sports arenas in southern California and Arizona. A bevy of chronic discrepancies dividing California's haves and have-nots - such as pricey real estate that forces multigenerational households into cramped dwellings and a labor market that relegates a large swath of Black and brown people to public-facing, high-risk roles - has fueled the virus's uneven spread. The Golden state struggles with some of the highest levels of income inequality nationwide, while Latinos "Are overrepresented in low-wage jobs and have higher unemployment rates," according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Residents of Santa Ana, a predominantly Latino city in southern California, have suffered almost 19% of Orange county's Covid cases and nearly one-fifth of its fatalities, despite representing just over 10% of the general population.
