> I just took this pic 8/20/20 at 11:30 AM in Lodi.  I don't really know what to do with it other than post it here and I'm freaking steaming mad.
> 
> edit 1: I've contacted the San Joaquin County Health Dept and am filing a complaint.  It's supposed to be anonymous.
> 
> edit 2: the Health Dept called me back and took the complaint.  I emailed them this pic, and they say they'll follow up with SJC Sheriffs.  Doubt I'll hear anything back but I believe I have done my civic duty to slow the spread.

> It's not explicitly Covid-19 centric, but it's very relevant with regards to n95 availability, and potential comorbidity.

## Sacramento sheriff's office won't enforce California coronavirus mask order

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/sacramento-sheriffs-office-wont-enforce-california-coronavirus-mask-order-1512334):

> The Sacramento County sheriff released a statement Friday saying his office will not enforce California Governor Gavin Newsom's new face mask requirement. "However, due to the minor nature of the offense, the potential for negative outcomes during enforcement encounters, and anticipating the various ways in which the order may be violated, it would be inappropriate for deputies to criminally enforce the Governor's mandate. Accordingly, the Sheriff's Office will not be doing so," the sheriff's office said. "Rather, we will continue to operate in an educational capacity in partnership with the County Health Office. As for the Sheriff's Office and its employees, we will comply with the Governor's mask recommendations to the extent feasible," the sheriff's office said.

> LAPD is not enforcing, despite what Santa Monica claims they are not enforcing it either. That is also true for West Hollywood sheriff and Beverly Hills police. I do not know of any police department that is actually enforcing mask order

## Orange County caterer has zero COVID precautions in pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/id1oe7/orange_county_caterer_has_zero_covid_precautions/):

> 24 Carrots Catering in Orange County are still putting on regular weddings, no social distancing, no masks, no guest count limits. People need to know how irresponsible this company is being in a pandemic. If the mayor of LA is willing to shut off power for parties, Orange County needs to do something similar to stop these parties from happening.

`/u/aorella2019` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/id1oe7/orange_county_caterer_has_zero_covid_precautions/):

> I agree. One of the hotels in Laguna Beach ( located in OC) had a wedding of 60 guests. I'm suprised that this is actually happening in the middle of a global pandemic. This pandemic has bought out the stupidity out of people. 
> 
> I would report them to the heath department or shoot an email to the governor's office. 
> 
> There needs to be some serious fines and enforcement for companies that do this.
