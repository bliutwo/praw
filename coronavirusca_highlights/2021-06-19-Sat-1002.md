Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/06/18/california-unemployment-rate-falls-for-4th-straight-month-regains-half-jobs-lost-pandemic/):

> SACRAMENTO - California has regained more than half of the 2.7 million jobs it lost at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Friday, a trend driven by restaurants and hotels hiring more people as the nation's most populous state reopens its economy. Employers added 104,500 new jobs in May as California's unemployment rate dipped slightly to 7.9% from 8% in April. It's still one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, but it is the fourth month in a row that the state has added at least 100,000 new jobs.
