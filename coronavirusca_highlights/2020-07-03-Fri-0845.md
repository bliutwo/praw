## Over 40 Bay Area school principals in quarantine after going to some conference where someone tested positive

Summary of [original article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/more-than-40-school-principals-in-quarantine-after-coronavirus-exposure-at-in-person-meeting/ar-BB16gjTB):

> More than 40 San Francisco Bay Area principals are in quarantine after being exposed to COVID-19 during an in-person meeting about how to reopen schools safely - an early indicator of how difficult it will be for the country's 13,000 school districts to operate amid the ongoing, and in some places surging, coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this week, the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group representing 67,000 pediatricians, said students should be in classrooms for in-person learning as soon as possible - the most full-throated endorsement yet for getting children back into schools amid the coronavirus pandemic. Under pressure to reopen by federal, state and local government officials, school districts are scrambling to draft reopening plans that include flexibility for school employees to work from home should they need to and the ability to rapidly shift from in-person learning to remote learning should anyone inside the school become infected.

## [Discussion] Governor Newsom's 07/02 Press Conference

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/hk2xde/discussion_governor_newsoms_0702_press_conference/):

> Masks keep Californians healthy! Wear One! Renewed emphasis on the evidence pointing to decreased transmission rates with masks. Q4: PSAs are great, but we need fines and orders from state level for masks and distancing, not local level. Q5: what will be done for OC's past disregard for mask orders? Is the fiscal contingency going to work for a county that has grossly disregarded rules?

> I will open the discussion with the following:
> 
> Newsom is taking a conservative, evidence-based approach for shutting down certain sectors. Perhaps he feels pressured from the industries as shutting down gyms and churches without the "data" may upset many.
> 
> He's dodging some questions blatantly but I don't fault him. California is already so divided, it is difficult to willingly make yourself the "bad guys" and enforce masks with tickets. You risk further dividing your people. That's not the goal. We need to unify and work together.
> 
> I primarily live and operate in Central California. I'm glad Ventura beach shut down but hope that Santa Barbara and San Diego also close for the safety of everyone involved.
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> On a lighter note, I'm glad that the Governor is being a human through all this. He jokingly welcomed names like the Governator and Snoop Dogg on the PSA lists. I think he's doing ok mentally although his belly has gotten a bit larger lately. Get some exercise and stay safe Governor!
