## California pushing teachers to front of vaccine line as supply increases

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-outlines-plan-to-give-teachers-vaccine-15979933.php):

> California will release about 75,000 vaccine doses every week for counties to administer to teachers and other education workers, under a plan announced by the governor's office Thursday that further prioritizes educators to quickly get schools reopened. Gov. Gavin Newsom promised last week to set aside a minimum of 10% of the state's vaccine supply for education workers. The state's plan does not specify whether teachers for lower grades will be prioritized over teachers for higher grades, as California pushes schools to reopen classrooms for younger children first.

## Judge rejects employers' challenge to California's coronavirus workplace protection rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Judge-rejects-employers-challenge-to-15981318.php):

> A challenge by retailers and growers to the state's emergency workplace regulations for COVID-19 - requiring employers to have prevention programs, provide protective equipment, test anyone who may have been exposed, and provide paid leave to ailing employees - was emphatically rejected Thursday by a San Francisco judge. In seeking to block regulations issued Nov. 30 by the state Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board under Gov. Gavin Newsom, the business groups provided only claims, without evidence, that the rules were unnecessary and financially burdensome, along with a far-fetched argument that no emergency existed, said Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman. The rules require every employer to have a written coronavirus prevention program, including training, identification of hazards, social distancing, and provision of masks and other protective equipment.
