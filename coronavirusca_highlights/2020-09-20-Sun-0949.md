> The TJs I’m at still doesn’t allow bags to be used just yet, you can bring them in but you have to bag them outside. It must just depend on the store at this point. Shout out to the sign team or always making quality signs!

## Is there any research on transmission in tented “outdoor” dining? I’ve been seeing photos of people dining in very elaborate tent setups that look essentially like dining indoors with very little air circulation happening.

## States partnering on mobile app to track COVID-19 exposure

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Regional-States-Partnering-On-Mobile-App-To-15575913.php):

> The state of California has partnered with other western states to pilot a mobile app designed by Google and Apple that notifies a user when they have been exposed to someone infected with the novel coronavirus. The app also does not collect, store or transmit identifying user information, according to the CDPH. "With the participation of the Western States Pact in this important endeavor, our public health officials and academic and technology partners can share experiences and lessons as they develop the Exposure Notification Express application," Gov. Gavin Newsom said. Location data submitted to the Covidseeker study will be de-identified and shared only with public agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the study's funder, and the CDPH. The exposure notification app pilot project is expected to launch later this month, according to California Department of Technology director Amy Tong.

> It is ridiculous. This thing is going to linger on until there is a vaccine. In my apt in nyc i’d say half of all tenants just refuse to wear a mask. And it just happens to be all the assholes...smokers, people who don’t pick-up their dog shit, the guy who tried to sell me a $20 Macy’s gift card with no $ on it...etc...
