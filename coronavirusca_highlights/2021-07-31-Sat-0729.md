## Following Governor Newsom’s First-in-the-Nation Vaccination Measures, California Employers Follow Suit

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/30/following-governor-newsoms-first-in-the-nation-vaccination-measures-california-employers-follow-suit/):

> SACRAMENTO - Throughout the past week, some of California's largest employers - both private businesses and local governments - have followed Governor Newsom's lead in implementing vaccine and testing measures for employees. San Diego County: "The County will begin requiring its employees to verify COVID-19 vaccination or undergo regular testing. Details being worked out but implementation expected by mid-August. Vaccination is the key to fully and safely reopening the economy." Netflix: "Netflix has become the first major studio to implement a mandatory vaccination policy for its U.S. productions. The move comes after studios and Hollywood unions last week finalized an agreement that allows producers to require vaccines for the people who are potentially at highest risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 on set: actors and the crew who work most closely with them. Netflix was particularly quick to implement the policy. More major studios are expected to follow in the coming weeks as they work out the challenging logistics of overhauling their approaches to pandemic safety on set."

> ETA: I know it's silly but I'm touched by all the support here. It makes me feel better not only for myself but for humanity — all of us erring on the side of caution is heartening.

## COVID vaccinations lag for people on Medi-Cal — In all California counties, Medi-Cal enrollees have been vaccinated at substantially lower rates than the overall population. Experts point to several factors for this economic divide, like the inability of low-income people to take time off work.

Summary of [original article](https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/medi-cal-covid-vaccinations/):

> In Los Angeles County, 70% of its overall population is vaccinated, compared to only 49% of people on Medi-Cal. In most California counties, only 25% to 35% of people on Medi-Cal are vaccinated. In the Eastern Sierra's Inyo County, the vaccination rate is almost twice as high among the general population than among people on Medi-Cal - 58% compared to 32%. But the disparity is not just happening in rural, remote or less affluent counties.

> I have a couple of friends who were scared to go get vaccinated because their jobs wouldn't give them time off if they experienced side effects and they wouldn't give them time off to even go get it

## CDC warns in internal document that 'war has changed' with the coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/cdc-warns-internal-document-war-has-changed-coronavirus-n1275478):

> Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, said that the CDC document highlighted reasons for concern but did not indicate that vaccinated people are at greater risk. The document notes that the risk of infection is threefold lower in vaccinated people, and the risk of severe disease or death is at least tenfold lower in vaccinated people. PCR results, the CDC wrote, "Might reflect the level of infectious virus." In other words, it could suggest that vaccinated people are as contagious as unvaccinated people.

`/u/j035u5` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ouo21i/cdc_warns_in_internal_document_that_war_has/):

> Worth noting that this was always somewhat expected, and that vaccines are still working well, if less well, against all known variants. Make sure you get vaccinated and encourage your friends and family to do the same.
