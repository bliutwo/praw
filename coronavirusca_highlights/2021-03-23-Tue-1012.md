> Please help build this thread by providing County websites and local subreddit threads that might help the people of this sub. Let's stick to positives and help people find vaccines! I started with the two counties I am familiar with. This is a post created to help people get vaccinated.

> 
> If county next to yours gets to your tier first, can you just get a vaccine there?

## PSA. Walgreens auto-scheduling 2nd Pfizer dose for 28 days out, instead of recommended 21. Cannot reschedule until 20 days after first dose.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/masco6/psa_walgreens_autoscheduling_2nd_pfizer_dose_for/):

> Scheduled my vaccine for Walgreens and saw they auto-scheduled my 2nd already for 28 days later. So they auto-schedule you for 28 days since Moderna can't be given early. You can't reschedule your 2nd dose until 20 days after your first.

`/u/MagicPistol` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/masco6/psa_walgreens_autoscheduling_2nd_pfizer_dose_for/):

> I don't see this 7 day difference as a big deal. As long as you're able to get your shot soon. Many people don't even have their first shot yet.

## The epic outreach to get the most vulnerable vaccinated in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-22/how-covid-vaccines-reaching-high-need-california-areas):

> Nearly half of all vaccines in California are going to about 400 ZIP Codes identified as high need, and state health officials have hinged the state's reopening plan on how quickly those doses can be distributed. "The vaccines are going to folks who are more likely to have time, cars, internet, everything you need to get an appointment. We have to build access and ensure that people who typically don't have access have access to these vaccines." "Just because there's more vaccines doesn't mean people will know how to get them," Trinh said.

`/u/wip30ut` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/mautqf/the_epic_outreach_to_get_the_most_vulnerable/):

> mad props to LA for putting in all this effort to reach out to poorer communities of color that don't have internet access, English fluency, or even a car to go to mass vaccination mega sites. These barrios and ghettos are the regions where entire families have had multiple of hospitalizations and deaths. During a firestorm you need to go where the flames are hottest, even if it's a slower more daunting rollout. 
> 
> I know there are critics who believe that we should prioritize speed & numbers above all else, but herd immunity doesn't work this way. Even if you reach 80% of the Work From Home crowd, it doesn't mean that poorer blue-collar service workers with much lower rates of vaccination will be protected. This virus hopscotches across communities like a wildfire.

> The responsibility for enforcing the health orders has really been passed around to zero positive effect. It often comes down to the willingness of your city/county Board of Supervisors having the strength of character to issue fines. And most don't.
> 
> Vicious cycle of no consequences.
