## 'I've seen people die.' COVID-19 slams Central Valley hospitals, as many resist lockdowns

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-13/san-joaquin-valley-coronavirus-hospitals-many-resist-lockdown):

> In Stockton, in the northern part of the five-county San Joaquin Valley, some small-business owners are demanding a reprieve from closures, arguing that this third round is arbitrary and unfair. "The hospitals are not overflowing because of restaurants," said Johnny Hernandez, co-owner of the Black Rabbit gastropub in Stockton, who joined a protest with other small-business owners Thursday on the steps of Stockton's City Hall. "My own neighbor told me they thought COVID wasn't real - a scam for hospitals to get money from the government," he said.

> Every business open in defiance of public health orders should all be held civilly liable for negligence and reckless endangerment. At the very least, their insurance carrier will drop them.  Consequences

> Freeze mortgages and property rent, and pay people to stay home? And thus can heavily punish those who go out?

> The text alerts are for emergencies only, not to harass people to do something they aren't going to do anyway.  If that system is abused it won't be respected when needed again in the future.
> 
> I think paying businesses for their lost sales is the only way to get people to stay home, but then how is that funded?  There's no simple answer, but a lot of people seem to be living in lala land and don't seem to understand people need to pay rent and buy groceries.  Until the COVID naggers can explain how to help people who are suffering financially good luck getting them to listen to you.

The early announcement is aimed at helping students and families as they plan for next year - and as they decide whether to apply to Cal State, university leaders said. "I urge eligible students across the Golden State to apply for admission to one or more CSU campuses."

## How will Last Stage Distribution of the Vaccine to the Public be handled?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kc8tyf/how_will_last_stage_distribution_of_the_vaccine/):

`/u/EvidenceBasedTxFTW` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/kc8tyf/how_will_last_stage_distribution_of_the_vaccine/):

> Good question. I suspect it will go through the same channels as our flu shots. The vaccine supply will be slow and steady so there’s no need for large centers, I think. If you usually get a flu shot from a “flu tent” outside your hospital, or from your doctor, at work, or from CVS, that’s probably how you’ll get it this time as well.

## State: ICU capacity now at 0% in San Joaquin Valley

Summary of [original article](https://www.kget.com/news/state-icu-capacity-now-at-0-in-san-joaquin-valley/):

> LODI, Calif. - In San Joaquin County, part of California's vast Central Valley that produces most of the country's fruits and vegetables, the coronavirus is spreading like a weed and the hospitals are running out of beds for the sickest patients. San Joaquin is part of a 12-county region that on Saturday had 100% of its intensive care unit beds filled, the highest rate anywhere in California. With cases continuing at an unprecedented rate, the death toll inevitably will grow, too.
