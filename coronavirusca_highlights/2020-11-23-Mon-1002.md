> I live in Virginia (I was lurking because I am daydreaming about a post virus trip there)
> 
> It is a civil offense to not wear a mask in public indoor areas here. You can take them off to sit down and eat.  It has been a law since May, but it got stricter in October. Now If you get caught it is a $500 fine (Y’all would be amazed at the number of people that started wearing their masks once a fine was involved hahahaha) 
> 
> If the businesses are caught not enforcing masks, they are fined and possibly shut down.  Honestly I’m not as up-to-date on those details because I’m not a business owner. 
> 
> People refusing to wear a mask is just crazy to me. It’s not hurting anything to wear it ; even if it turns out you didn’t need it. But I can’t say the same for the opposite. I’m not on this earth to judge anybody though.   I just keep my distance when I see someone not wearing a mask.  I can only control me.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-Gov-Gavin-Newsom-and-his-family-in-15747096.php):

> Gov. Gavin Newsom and his family are in quarantine after three of Newsom's four children were exposed to a person from the California Highway Patrol who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Newsom spokesperson Jesse Melgar said that Newsom and Siebel Newsom "Had no direct interaction with the officer. The family were all tested today and are all negative for COVID-19. However, consistent with local guidance, the family has begun to quarantine." The rest of the family did not quarantine due to this exposure.

> It takes a few days before infections become "cases."  The cases that get reported each day are for infections that happened days or weeks earlier.
> 
> I think this means we've already passed this threshold.  The time to act to prevent this was last month.  People fucked up Halloween.
> 
> Obviously, acting now is still critical, to reduce the impact.  But, it won't stop us running out of beds.

> 1 in 30 people in LA have tested positive for covid-19. I assume many more had it and didn't test positive. People seem to just not give a fuck based on the parties I've seen in my apartment complex and the crazy high percentage of people who don't wear a mask in the hallways and elevators (I'd estimate it at 30-40%).
