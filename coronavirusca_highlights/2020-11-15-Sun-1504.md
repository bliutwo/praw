## California sees fastest growth in new daily coronavirus cases

`/u/FartsGracefully` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/ju4obw/california_sees_fastest_growth_in_new_daily/):

> It doesn't help that my job has people taking week long trips to vegas and going to casinos that are close by too. It shouldn't be too much of a problem, but these people are the ones who think covid isn't a big deal and won't even wear their mask properly when at work.  My county is one where the police refuse to enforce mask rules. Management also believed after Nov. 3rd covid would vanish. I feel so helpless at work.

## Hospital visitation policies in the Bay Area

`/u/I-Love-Toads` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/jugcjz/hospital_visitation_policies_in_the_bay_area/):

> I think some more restrictions should be put in place. However, I don't like the idea of banning in person visits entirely. People shouldn't be forced to suffer and die alone in the hospital without seeing their family. Testing and self qurantine prior to visit should be put in place instead of a blanket ban.
