## California Under-Reporting Virus Cases Due to Technical Issue

Summary of [original article](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/08/04/california-under-reporting-virus-cases-due-to-technical-issue/):

> Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said California recently stopped receiving a full count of tests conducted, or positive results, through electronic lab reports due to an unresolved issue he did not describe. After the issue came to light, county health officials posted notices on their sites advising of the lag and that a drop in cases might not paint a full picture. On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom gave his most optimistic report on the state's virus efforts since a second surge of cases in early June.

## Inland counties donâ€™t meet waiver criteria to reopen elementary schools

Summary of [original article](https://www.pe.com/2020/08/04/inland-counties-dont-meet-waiver-criteria-to-reopen-elementary-schools/):

> Riverside and San Bernardino counties have too many new coronavirus cases to meet the state's recommended criteria to reopen elementary schools, even under the new waiver system that state health officials announced Monday, Aug. 3. The waiver would allow elementary schools to reopen their campus if their county is on the state's watch list of counties with concerningly high coronavirus numbers. The threshold to be on the state's monitoring list is 100 cases per 200,000, and counties with more than double that number "Should not be considered for a waiver to re-open in-person instruction," the waiver guidelines state.
