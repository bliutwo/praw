## California sees signs COVID Delta variant surge is slowing

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-17/california-sees-signs-delta-surge-is-slowing-but-a-new-challenge-looms):

> California enters a crucial phase in its battle against the Delta variant this week - the reopening of schools - with some hopeful signs: The number of people being infected and falling seriously ill with COVID-19 is no longer accelerating at dramatic rates and even beginning to flatten in some areas. While San Francisco has seen a decrease in daily coronavirus cases, which might have been the result of people increasingly wearing masks, it is "Too early to conclude that the fourth surge has peaked or plateaued, and hospitalizations generally peak two weeks after the cases," San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said in a statement to The Times. The experience in Britain shows that, particularly in a highly vaccinated area, a surge in the Delta variant can hit quickly but also fade relatively quickly, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Francisco.

> This article is all about a slowdown of the *rate of increase*. 
> 
> Which, you know, is good news. But it's not actually the same thing as numbers going down. It just means they're going up less quickly than they were going up before.
> 
> Hopefully it's a precursor to the numbers actually going down, but there are lots of reasons why that might not be the case (even before we start talking about school starting, etc).

## Sharp rise in pregnant women contracting the coronavirus prompts new warnings

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-17/rise-in-pregnant-women-getting-covid-cues-new-warnings):

> At Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, doctors are now seeing a higher proportion of pregnant women among their COVID-19 patients, including five who required admission to the intensive care unit, said Dr. Marlon Mills, the director of maternal fetal medicine at Hoag. Pregnant women have a far higher risk of serious complications, hospitalization, needing ICU care and dying because of COVID-19 compared with women who are not pregnant, Mills said. "Although rare, women infected during their pregnancy can pass on the virus to their newborn. Among the 10,998 births where there was testing information, 55 infants tested positive for COVID-19. Twelve pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 have tragically passed away," Los Angeles County public health officials said in a statement Monday.

> I wish these articles clarified if the risk is also for vaccinated women or just because pregnant women were not included in the trials and therefore the CDC held off recommending the shot to those women.

## How kids can stay safer at school despite Delta variant threat

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-08-17/how-kids-can-stay-safe-at-school-despite-delta-variant-threat):

> Despite the threats posed by the coronavirus, experts say there are ways to enhance kids' safety at school. "Vaccination of all eligible adults and students is the most important strategy for decreasing COVID-19 transmission in schools," said Dr. Kate Connor, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "The evidence is strongly supportive that universal masking in schools is one way to keep children safe," said Mercedes Carnethon, an epidemiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
