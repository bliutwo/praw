A bar owner was arrested in connection with selling fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards, the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control said Tuesday. Luke Blehm, a spokesperson with ABC, told KCRA 3 the agency launched an undercover operation after receiving complaints that fake vaccine cards were being made at The Old Corner Saloon in Clements.

> While selling obviously shouldn't be permitted, the issue is really anyone accepting these as proof. You can download the PDF of the template online. These aren't ever meant to prevent forgery. They are for your own records and to time the multiple doses.

## COVID: California's coronavirus hospitalizations hit all-time low

Summary of [original article](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/01/covid-californias-coronavirus-hospitalizations-hit-all-time-low):

> Coronavirus hospitalizations in California have dropped to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago, fueled by a surge in vaccinations and one of the lowest case rates in the country. Across the 10-county Bay Area, there were just 360 people hospitalized with COVID-19, fewer than at any time of the pandemic except for a few days last June when hospitalizations briefly dropped to the low 350s. One day last week, not a single person with the coronavirus came through the Stanford Hospital emergency department. Unlike in the past, when dips in hospitalizations came with the real threat of a surge just around the corner, this decline feels more stable.

> It seems like just a few months ago that hospitals were so overwhelmed that the closest hospital to me turned their employee parking garage into the overflow non-COVID-19 emergency room.

## California coronavirus case rates keep 'falling like a rock' despite surges in Oregon, Washington

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-03/california-coronavirus-cases-fall-amid-oregon-washington-surges):

> Even as Oregon and Washington face new COVID-19 surges, there is growing optimism that California remains in recovery mode as coronavirus cases continued to fall dramatically along with related deaths. There are now fewer than 2,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases a day on average over the past week in California, a huge drop from about 45,000 cases a day at the peak of the surge in December and January. There hasn't been a troubling surge in California and Arizona, which have observed more cases of the California variant than the U.K. variant.

> Where in OR/WA are the surges?  Throughout the states?  Tending to the east or west?
