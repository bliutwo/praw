Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/559623-70-percent-of-californians-over-12-have-received-one-shot-of-coronavirus):

> Over 70% of Californians 12 and older have now received at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Newsom announced on May 31 that 70 percent of the state's adult population had received at least one vaccine dose. White House coronavirus response coordinator said during a coronavirus briefing that the country is currently on track to having 70 percent of adults aged 27 and older with one vaccine dose, but it would likely take "a few extra weeks" for all adults aged 18 and up to reach the same percentage.

## Bay Area parents with unvaccinated children unsure how to navigate reopened California

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Bay-Area-parents-with-unvaccinated-children-16260894.php):

> Parents of young children say they're feeling left behind, and even finding themselves trapped in a new conundrum: How do they keep kids too young to be vaccinated safe as the world around them reopens? The reopening of schools is its own fraught issue in many California communities, as districts contemplate how to bring children back full time and reassure parents and teachers that it's safe. Some parents say the state's reopening puts their children at greater risk because restrictions like masking and social distancing have largely gone away.

`/u/SnappaDaBagels` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCA/comments/o592us/bay_area_parents_with_unvaccinated_children/):

> The lack of guidance is sure frustrating, but even more so is the lack of data. 
> 
> Lots of people point out that child mortality from covid is pretty rare, but myself and parents I know aren't scared of just death. There's a fear of getting seriously ill, and especially longterm affects / long covid. Some studies suggest as much as 25% of people who get covid have symptoms that last months, or longer (lifetime?). This wasn't tracked until recently, so there isn't much data on how risky covid actually is to kids.

## This bill was meant to protect California workers from COVID. Some counties use it to protect employers instead.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ocregister.com/2021/06/20/this-bill-was-meant-to-protect-california-workers-from-covid-some-counties-use-it-to-protect-employers-instead/):

> In the thick of the pandemic, California adopted a law to tell workers of dangers their employers often kept secret: Which workplaces had suffered outbreaks of COVID-19, and how severe they were. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said that county has never received a complaint regarding identification of an individual based on its posting of workplace outbreak data. An analysis of county records shows that e-commerce giant Amazon has reported more than 1,700 cases at warehouse, distribution and grocery facilities in Riverside, Solano, Contra Costa, San Joaquin and Kern counties.
