## A clarification of our topicality rules and submissions regarding events at the Capitol

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kz8qya/a_clarification_of_our_topicality_rules_and/):

> We have been receiving a lot of submissions about the incidents at the US Capitol and their aftermath, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our topicality rules for these. Submissions focused on statements from politicians, the incident as a whole, or new legislation related to it are more topically appropriate for r/Politics and more likely to be approved. With the FBI and DOJ announcing investigations, we expect to see more stories regarding arrests, identification efforts, and criminal charges in the coming days and weeks.

## Hundreds of writers and book agents sign joint letter demanding publishing industry bans Trump memoir

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/publishers-trump-memoir-ban-book-deal-b1788904.html):

> Editors, publishing agents and authors have signed-up to a letter in the hundreds, demanding the industry deny Donald Trump the publication of any post-presidential memoir. Together, they oppose any Trump administration official from publishing a future book - including the outgoing president, who is rumoured to be considering a memoir. Barry Lyga, a novelist who organised the letter, wrote that "As members of the writing and publishing community of the United States, we affirm that participation in the administration of Donald Trump must be considered a uniquely mitigating criterion for publishing houses when considering book deals."

`/u/Nano_Burger` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kzw2yl/hundreds_of_writers_and_book_agents_sign_joint/):

> Trump's memoir will be a shitty self-published affair rife with misspellings and incoherent run-on sentences.

## Barr told Trump that theories about stolen election were 'bulls---': report

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/534672-barr-told-trump-that-theories-about-stolen-election-were-bulls-report):

> Barr, during a meeting with Trump at the White House in early December, told the president that such theories of a stolen election were "Bullshit," Axios reported Monday. ADVERTISEMENT. Trump announced almost two weeks later, on Dec. 14, that Barr would step down from his position in the Trump administration, leaving roughly a month before President-elect would enter office. The president had sharply criticized the attorney general leading up to his exit over Barr's remarks about alleged election fraud as well as reports that Barr knew about a federal investigation into Biden's son Hunter Biden months before the election but had kept it from public view.

`/u/StanDarkloard` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kzuln7/barr_told_trump_that_theories_about_stolen/):

> They were never "theories". They were lies specifically designed to attempt to STEAL the office of President of the United States from the legitimate winner of the election (Joe Biden).
