## Texans testifying on GOP voting bill faced a 17 hour-wait to be heard by lawmakers in the dead of night

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/10/texas-legislature-gop-voting-bill/):

> The legislation on the table in many ways resembles the contentious GOP-backed voting bill that failed during the regular legislative session that ended in May after House Democrats orchestrated a walkout to break quorum before the chamber could give the bill a final vote. In Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 3, Republicans revived proposals to rein in local voting initiatives like drive-thru and 24-hour voting, further tighten the rules for voting by mail, bolster access for partisan poll watchers and ban local election officials from proactively sending out applications to request mail-in ballots. For advocates for people with disabilities, the special session offered them the first opportunity during the debate over the voting bills to bring their voting experiences to the legislative forefront in larger numbers.

> The 'lawmakers' were just getting them used to the conditions that they will have to face if the voting bill passes.  I'm surprised that no one was arrested for handing out water to those waiting.

## Biden Warns Putin: Take Action to Disrupt Ransomware Attacks or U.S. Will Act

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-warns-putin-ransomware-attacks-1195473/):

> In a Friday call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, President Biden told the leader that he must "Take action" against ransomware cybercriminals based in his country who have attacked the United States. Signaling the attacks on U.S. infrastructure and businesses have moved from only warnings and being treated as criminal acts to national security threats, Biden insisted Putin must act. According to the New York Times, when Biden was asked by a reporter if continued inaction by Putin could result in retaliatory consequences against the servers Russian cybercriminals have used to hijack American networks, Biden responded, "Yes.".

`/u/Reptorian` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oi3br8/biden_warns_putin_take_action_to_disrupt/):

> More sanctions against Russia would be welcome. They should pay for attempting to destroy democracy.
