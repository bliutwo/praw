> Female "auditors" here in AZ are accusing their male counterparts of harassment. There are whistleblowers on local news claiming they saw ballots being damaged by "auditors". The whole process is a sham, and yet somehow a bunch of people here (including my father) still buy it as legitimate. Also, anecdotally, backlash against Sinema seems to grow by the day.

## Exxon Exposed: Greenpeace Tricks Top Lobbyists into Naming Senators They Use to Block Climate Action

Summary of [original article](https://www.democracynow.org/2021/7/6/exxon_blocks_congressional_action_climate):

> Congressmember Khanna made the request after Greenpeace UK released a stunning video, where two top lobbyists discussed Exxon's secretive efforts to fight climate initiatives in Washington. For decades, critics have claimed Exxon deploys cynical, aggressive lobbying techniques to pull the strings of government, while running clandestine campaigns to block action on climate change, discredit its opponents and distract attention from its polluting activities. CHARLIE KRONICK: I think the most amazing and surprising thing about these revelations is that: Is anybody still surprised at what Exxon is doing? You know, I think that the reality is that almost nothing has changed in the Exxon playbook in terms of their appearance to want to be seen to be credible on climate change, while at the same time spending an amazing amount of time, resources to slow down progress on climate change, at a time when we just simply have zero time left for delay, obfuscation or debate on what should be done when.

## Jared Kushner said 'I don't give a f--- about the future of the Republican Party,' according to new book

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-rnc-i-dont-give-a-f-book-2021-7):

> Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former President Donald Trump and an ex-White House adviser, got into "An intense argument" with Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel ahead of the 2020 election, a new book reportedly says. "I don't give a f-- about the future of the Republican Party!'" Kushner reportedly told McDaniel in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. Fox News on Tuesday published excerpts from the book, "Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost," by the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender, out next Tuesday. McDaniel was already being left out of key strategy meetings - Kushner added insult to injury when he considered taking over the RNC's online fundraising platform, WinRed, because he "Didn't think the RNC could pull off the new operation," the book reportedly says.

> Man, what a shocker.

> What if it's not just him, but the whole Trump crew was just manipulating the GOP base, and never gave one flying fuck about them or their party?

## Republican strategist rails against her own party: ‘It’s Neofascism!’

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_60e3b8ade4b06fb1a6ee546e):

> A Republican strategist is speaking out against the rise of the extreme right inside her own party. "Forget Trumpism. It's neofascism. That's what the grassroots of the party looks like right now." Del Percio was asked specifically about former Rep. Allen West, a far-right figure in the party who said he will challenge Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in the primary next year.

`/u/the_bionic_investor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oexoow/republican_strategist_rails_against_her_own_party/):

> I find it hilarious that people like Alex Jones have been railing against “fascism” because Democrats implemented Mitt Romney’s halfass “socialized healthcare” (aka corporate giveaway) plan on a federal level but support actual fascism. Wtf are they even fighting for?
