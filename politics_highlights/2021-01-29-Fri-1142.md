## Florida Republican Wants to Exclude Felons From Minimum Wage Increase Because Florida Republicans Are Terrible People

Summary of [original article](https://www.theroot.com/florida-republican-wants-to-exclude-felons-from-minimum-1846152390):

> So what brilliant justification did Florida Man in a suit come up with for why such a harmful and reprehensibly apathetic measure would even be necessary. "Because the unemployment rate for those groups before the wage increase was 20%+ it will be much higher after without this," Brandes said in one response to smart people who know he's proposing some dumbass shit. I just wish that hateful and vile excuses of mutated human excrement like Brandes would just be honest and say they hate felons, young people, poor people and non-whites instead of being so manipulative that they laughably claim they are only trying to help.

> Translation - “Republicans want to rig the system so that people getting out of prison cannot make it and have to resort to crime to survive.....leading to them going back to prison.  Republicans are also invested in private prisons and make money from people being locked up.”
> 
> I’ll never vote for another Republican again.  The “conservative” party is a disgusting abomination.

> Also makes me wonder how the Russians seem so much better at all this than the US, the country supposedly with all of the hotshot tech.

> President Joe Biden has been "In close contact" with Speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding threats surrounding congressional lawmakers following the deadly pro-Trump attacks on the US Capitol, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday. The White House said Mr Biden was discussing the concerns with Ms Pelosi on a "Nearly daily basis" after the Speaker suggested part of the security issues surrounding Capitol Hill have been spurred by the conduct and rhetoric of some House Republicans. Asked to clarify what she meant by her comments about an "Enemy within the House of Representatives," the speaker said: "It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress."

## Lawmakers push Biden to offer recurring $2,000 stimulus checks

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/biden-stimulus-check-2000-recurring-democratic-lawmakers/):

> As Congress debates President Joe Biden's request for $1.9 trillion in coronavirus relief funding - including a third stimulus check pegged at $1,400 - some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for an even bigger response: $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is history. While the letter didn't specify an amount for a recurring stimulus payment, Rep. Omar tweeted on Thursday that she would like to see payments of $2,000 per month until the global health crisis has ended. Asked about Omar's request for recurring stimulus payments, Sperling noted that Biden's $1.9 trillion proposal includes several recurring aid programs, including $400 in extra weekly jobless benefits and an increase in tax credits to $3,600 per child under 6-years-old.

## Russia has been cultivating Trump as an asset for 40 years, says former KGB spy

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-cultivating-trump-asset-40-years-says-ex-kgb-spy-2021-1):

> The KGB cultivated Donald Trump as an asset for 40 years, and he proved a highly valuable asset in repeating anti-Western Russian propaganda in the United States, a former KGB operative told The Guardian. Shvets told The Guardian that the KGB had identified Trump, then an up-and-coming property developer, as a potential asset in the 1980s. Shvets told The Guardian that KGB operatives were then stunned to discover that Trump had returned to the United States, mulled a run for office, and taken out a full-page ad in several newspapers that echoed anti-Western Russian talking points.

## Amnesia nation: To "forget" the Trump era is a toxic act of privilege — and very dangerous. "Moving forward" without a public reckoning is an act of willful blindness — and a massive historical mistake

> The last time the Capitol was stormed was back in 1812 when the British stormed the Capitol.  Trump and his terrorists managed to do something that hadn't been done in over 200 years.  And the worst part about this is, the criminals that stormed the Capitol on January 6th did it based on a mountain of lies made up by the ex-president!
> 
> To make it worse, the Republicans in the Senate are about to let Trump off ... **again**.  And then you have the leader of the Republicans in the House and over 100 Republican House members defending Trump's insurrection.
> 
> How can you "forget" this?
