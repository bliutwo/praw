## Hi, I'm Caitlyn Kim, Colorado Public Radio's D.C. correspondent (and the only permanent Capitol correspondent in the state). Also, one year for fun I ran 13 half marathons and one full one. Ask me anything!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l0mtdn/hi_im_caitlyn_kim_colorado_public_radios_dc/):

> I cover U.S. Capitol for Colorado Public Radio, a state that, in the past year, flipped a senate seat blue, elected GOP political newcomer and MAGA supporter Lauren Boebert to Colorado's largest district, and voted for Joe Biden by one of the largest margins in state history. I was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and will be covering the inauguration tomorrow. Gotta get to work now...it's a busy week! P.S. We address many of your questions in our CPR's podcast about Colorado Politics - it's called Purplish.

> Coloradoan here. What's your sense of constituents' opinions of Lauren Boebert's shenanigans over the last couple of weeks? Would the Western Slope be interested in a recall?

## Trump's second impeachment after Capitol riots isn't enough. He needs to go to prison.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-second-impeachment-after-capitol-riots-isn-t-enough-ncna1254697):

> Jan. 19, 2021, 4:13 PM UTC. By Sam Liccardo, mayor of San Jose.The second impeachment of President Donald Trump has concluded, not with a bang, but with a whimper. To deter the next unhinged narcissist from using the presidency to undermine the electoral process, a jury must convict Trump of his crimes. Trump previously suffered impeachment for deploying unlawful means to remain in power - using his office to leverage Ukraine to investigate then-Democratic opponent Joe Biden's family.

> For which illegal act? Because he has a CVS receipt of crimes that anyone else would go to jail for.

## McConnell: Trump 'provoked' crowd that stormed Capitol

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/534804-mcconnell-trump-provoked-crowd-that-stormed-capitol):

> Outgoing Senate Majority Leader on Tuesday accused of provoking the violent crowd that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. "The last time the Senate convened, we had just reclaimed the Capitol from violent criminals who tried to stop Congress from doing our duty. The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people," McConnell said on the Senate floor, marking the first convening of the full Senate since the attack. More recently, McConnell has left colleagues guessing on how he might vote on the article of impeachment, which accuses Trump of inciting insurrection at the Capitol.

> I've literally never been so pumped about something McConnell said to the Senate.

> Magnitsky Act round 2. The US needs to go after Semion Mogilevich and cut the head off Putin’s masters in Russian mafia with a targeted sanctions assault that makes the first round look like a joke.

## 2 National Guard Members Removed From Biden Inauguration Over Militia Ties

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/national-guard-members-militia-biden-inauguration_n_60070306c5b6ffcab967e869):

> WASHINGTON - Two U.S. Army National Guard members have been removed from the presidential inauguration security mission after they were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups, according to two U.S. Army officials. The removal comes as the FBI has warned law enforcement officials about the possibility that right-wing fringe groups could pose as members of the National Guard called in to help secure the city after a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters shocked the nation, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter. U.S. defense officials, worried about a potential insider attack or other threat from service members involved in securing the event, pushed the FBI to vet all of the 25,000 National Guard troops coming into the area.

`/u/horseydeucey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l0nauo/2_national_guard_members_removed_from_biden/):

> Am I crazy by thinking if a national guard member cannot be trusted to serve in the inauguration of a president because of militia ties, they probably should be deemed unfit to serve in any capacity?
