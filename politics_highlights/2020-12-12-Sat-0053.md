> > Several Republicans who signed their names to the amicus brief for the Texas lawsuit understood it would likely quickly be shot down by the Supreme Court and only viewed it, like many other things in Trump's world, as a loyalty test. But Trump told people he thought he'd prevail.
> 
> Just sickening. Betray your entire country to remain loyal to this idiot.

> We're in an economic tailspin poised on the edge of a depression.  We're fighting a global pandemic that's killed almost 300,000 Americans and will kill many more before we can get a vaccine distributed.  Numerous industries are either closed or crippled.  Even schools are having trouble keeping kids safe.  We've just had a disputed election and the sitting President is refusing to voluntarily transition power.  Millions are unemployed and weeks from losing their benefits.

> Who are the 45% who say we are better off now than 4 years ago?

`/u/UWCG` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kbibmm/pelosi_gop_brought_dishonor_to_the_house_for/):

> > “The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions,” Pelosi said in a statement.
> > 
> > “The pandemic is raging, with nearly 300,000 having died and tens of millions having lost jobs," she added. "Strong, unified action is needed to crush the virus, and Republicans must once and for all end their election subversion – immediately.”
> 
> She's completely right about them. The fact that the majority of the GOP members of the House signed up to try to undermine the election is absolutely a disgrace to the United States, and to the House as a whole.
