## There is 'no doubt' Joe Biden won Georgia, says Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-secretary-of-state-no-doubt-biden-won-georgia-election-2020-11):

> President-elect Joe Biden clearly won Georgia and its 16 electoral votes, the state's top elections official - an elected Republican - said Thursday, adding that he hasn't seen any evidence to support the Trump campaign's conspiracy theories about a stolen vote. "There is no doubt" that Biden won, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told Atlanta network WSB-TV. "The numbers support that. So does the audit." Outgoing President Donald Trump and his legal team have baselessly claimed that there was significant voter and electoral fraud in the Republican-led state.
