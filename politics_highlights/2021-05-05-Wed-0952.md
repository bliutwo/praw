## My name is Tammy Duckworth, and I lived on food stamps as a teenager, grew up to become an Army Black Hawk pilot, got shot down in Iraq, lost my legs, and then became a mother and a U.S. Senator. AMA.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n5jeio/my_name_is_tammy_duckworth_and_i_lived_on_food/):

> Hi, Reddit! My name is Tammy Duckworth, and although I'm a U.S. Senator now, I never imagined I'd become a politician. We lived on food stamps there, and I handed out booze cruise flyers and sold roses by the side of the road to support my family. In 2004, I deployed to Iraq, where my Black Hawk was shot down by an enemy RPG that blew into the cockpit and exploded in my lap.

## Growing Calls to 'Audit the Ultra-Rich' as Yellen Says Tax Dodging Could Cost US $7 Trillion Over 10 Years | "Imagine what we could do for people with $7 trillion. That's infrastructure, child care, paid leave, free college, climate action, and other investments in our communities."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/05/05/growing-calls-audit-ultra-rich-yellen-says-tax-dodging-could-cost-us-7-trillion-over):

> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that tax dodging could cost the federal government around $7 trillion in revenue over a decade, an estimate that comes as progressive lawmakers and President Joe Biden are calling for increased IRS funding to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. During an event hosted by The Atlantic, Yellen called the $7 trillion gap between what the federal government is collecting and what is owed under the current tax code "Really shocking and distressing." Yellen's estimate resembles the conclusion a 2019 paper that found, "Between 2020 and 2029, the IRS will fail to collect nearly $7.5 trillion of taxes it is due." "We can start closing this gap next week. Pass my Stop CHEATERS Act and audit the ultra-rich," tweeted Rep. Ro Khanna, referring to his bill that calls for $100 billion in additional funding for the IRS and stricter reporting requirements to stem tax dodging by the rich and large corporations.

> Some on the Right will lament and complain this is punishing people for being successful. Context matter though and the target are those who break the law. Society uses soft words like "dodge" and 'avoid' to describe what is in fact a federal offense. We ALL pay taxes.

> "Kind of?"
> 
> Rand Paul's first action after learning he'd been exposed and might be positive was to *go to the Senate gym and try to infect as many of his colleagues as he could before his test results came back.*
> 
> Democrat, Republican, legislative aide, janitorial staff, he didn't care. He tried to kill fellow human beings for jollies. He's "kind of" a lunatic the way the Joker is "kind of" a lunatic.

## Ted Lieu Says 'History Will Not Be Kind' to Bill Barr Following Mueller Report Memo Order

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/william-barr-ted-lieu-mueller-inquiry-justice-department-memo-history-1588728):

> Representative Ted Lieu has condemned former Attorney General Bill Barr who faces claims that the Justice Department he used to head provided misleading advice over whether to charge ex-President Donald Trump with obstruction of justice. Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered the Justice Department to turn over a memo from March 2019 that Barr had cited as the reason for not charging Trump following the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Jackson's criticism is not the first time Barr has faced legal questions about the Mueller report.

Barr was responsible for taking the information from Mueller's report and applying any charges if necessary.  However, Barr pretty much let Trump get away with obstruction of justice.  Most corrupt president and AG in US history.  SMH.

Pandemic food help will continue through the 2021-2022 school year and summer and could go on even longer, as it's tied to the Covid public health emergency declaration In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in April that all children will receive universal free school lunch through June 30, 2022 due to the pandemic.
