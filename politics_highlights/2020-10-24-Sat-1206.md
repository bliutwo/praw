It propably didn't help that he was a black man in a predominantly white city. Utah is often the most Republican state in the Union.

## Andrew Cuomo after Trump debate attack: 'New York has a lower infection rate than the White House'

Summary of [original article](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/andrew-cuomo-trump-debate-attack-new-york-has-lower-infection-rate-white-house-073406492.html):

> On The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was live following the presidential debate Thursday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo shot back at President Trump, who slammed the state's handling of the coronavirus during the debate. "Trump hates New York, feelings are probably mutual. We did the exact opposite that he has done on this COVID situation. He's lied to the nation about it, and we did the exact opposite," Cuomo said, adding, "We acknowledged it, we were smart about it, we are united, we worked together and we brought the rate down now to one of the lowest rates in the United States of America. New York has a lower infection rate than the White House, Stephen." "This state turned everything around. That's what bothers him about New York, it shows him what this country could have done. How did we go from the highest rate in the United States to one of the lowest infection rates in the United States after what New York went through, and why isn't that the story in every state?" Cuomo asked.

## Trump tweet blaming ‘Blacks and Hispanics’ for violent crime resurfaces after ‘least racist person’ claim — There's always a tweet.

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/trump-tweet-black-hispanic-least-racist/):

> President Donald Trump claimed during Thursday night's debate that he was the "Least racist person in the room." People are pointing to one of his old tweets to argue otherwise. Following Trump's "Least racist person" claim, Twitter users unearthed a damning 2013 tweet in which the president blamed the majority of violent crime in the United States on people of color. For now, deleting problematic old tweets proves a bridge too far for the Trump administration, and as the president's "Black and Hispanics" tweet made the rounds again last night, many people echoed a refrain that has become commonplace over the last four years: There's always a tweet.

> It is weird how most conservatives can recite dozens of ‘black crime statistics’ from memory.

## Trump Organization renewed the TrumpTowerMoscow.com domain name — this year

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/10/24/trump-organization-renewed-the-trumptowermoscowcom-domain-name--this-year/):

> The Trump Organization reregistered the domain name TrumpTowerMoscow.com this June, internet records show, suggesting that contrary to President Trump's claims, the company has not necessarily abandoned its pursuit of the lucrative real estate deal that figured prominently in multiple investigations into his connections with Russia. Longtime Trump associate Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman whose efforts to build the Moscow tower date back to the early 2000s, told Salon that he turned ownership of the domain over to the Trump Organization in 2015, when Trump signed a letter of intent to develop the project. Initially envisioned as the tallest building in Europe, Trump Tower Moscow was spearheaded on the Trump side by Sater and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, and included the personal involvement of Ivanka Trump.

> This ends with him and his family on a plane to Russia. I hope that NY AG gives him a notice to appear as he’s walking out the back door of the White House.  That’s the only thing that could stop him.
