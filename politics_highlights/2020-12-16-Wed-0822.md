## QAnon Supporters Vow to Leave GOP After Mitch McConnell Accepts Election Result

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/qanon-mitch-mcconnell-joe-biden-election-1555115):

> Conspiracy theory have unsurprisingly turned their backs on Mitch McConnell after he finally congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his election victory. Accounts also announced on social media that they are considering leaving the GOP as a result of McConnell's betrayal against Trump, who the conspiracy theorists see as a savior-like figure. Supporters also attacked McConnell for recognizing Biden as the winner of the election.

## Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez echoes progressive ultimatum for stimulus checks: 'If Congress needs to spend Christmas on the House floor, so be it'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-makes-covid-relief-vote-conditional-on-inclusion-of-stimulus-checks-2020-12):

> The Congressional Progressive Caucus issued a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday asking for $2,000 stimulus checks to be included in the next relief package. Ocasio-Cortez reiterated her commitment to pushing the first stimulus checks since April on Twitter, tweeting "I will not vote for a COVID package that doesn't include survival payments and unemployment relief for the American people. It's a red line. It's also common sense." In the bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill formally unveiled on Monday, party leaders negotiated to include $300 of weekly federal unemployment insurance from December through April 9, but did not include stimulus checks.

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/530428-obama-republican-party-is-the-minority-party-in-this-country):

> Former President Obama on Tuesday labeled the Republican Party as "The minority party in this country" in a late-night interview.

Obama cited his new book "A Promised Land" that was released last month in the interview, saying the first time he went to the House Republican caucus he noticed a lack of diversity among the lawmakers.
