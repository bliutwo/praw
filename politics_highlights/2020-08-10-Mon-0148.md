## 'You better watch out if Trump is reelected': Critics warn new executive orders will 'defund' Medicare and social security

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-medicare-social-security-executive-orders-defund-payroll-tax-cuts-biden-a9661986.html):

> In an interview on Sunday morning with ABC News, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the president's payroll tax holiday essentially "Depletes money out of the social security and Medicare trust funds", noting how both programmes are funded by taxpayer dollars. He added: "If you're a social security recipient or Medicare recipient, you better watch out if President Trump is re-elected." Val Demings, seen as a leading choice to serve as the Democratic Party's nominee for vice president, issued a damning statement after the president announced his executive orders, writing on Twitter: "The American people desperately need relief. Instead, the president decided to defund Social Security and Medicare."

## How Trump Killed Tens of Thousands of Americans: A blow-by-blow account of his personal role in the coronavirus catastrophe.

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-coronavirus-deaths-timeline.html?via=rss):

> The interviewer, Chris Wallace, showed Trump a video clip in which Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned of a difficult fall and winter ahead. Trump dismissed the warning. On Feb. 10, just before a rally in New Hampshire, Trump told Fox News host Trish Regan that the Chinese "Have everything under control. We're working with them. You know, we just sent some of our best people over there." Then Trump walked onstage and exploited the political payoff of his deal with Xi. "Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents," he boasted. There's no evidence of Trump peddling the warm-weather theory prior to Feb. 7, when he had an overnight phone call with Xi. Immediately after that call, Trump began to promote the idea.

> >A proactive CDC testing program, lacking presidential support, never got off the ground. Nor did a separate national testing plan—organized by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner—which was supposed to be presented for Trump’s approval but, for unknown reasons, was never announced.

> 
> >Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.

> “**It’s mind-blowing that you can’t get the government to improve the  testing because they just want to say how great it is**,” he continued.  “I’ve said to them, look, have a CDC website that prioritizes who gets  tested. Don’t reimburse any test where the result goes back after three  days. **You’re paying billions of dollars in this very inequitable way to  get the most worthless testing results in the world**.”

## Blumenthal calls classified briefing on Russian interference "absolutely chilling"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/blumenthal-briefing-russian-interference-2ecde46b-1a7a-4f1e-a2c7-1215db70d348.html):

> Sen. Richard Blumenthal called on the Trump administration to declassify intelligence detailing Russian efforts to influence the 2020 elections, telling MSNBC on Sunday that the classified briefing lawmakers received about the Kremlin's activities last week was "Absolutely chilling." The big picture: National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said in a statement Friday that the Russian government is "Using a range of measures" to "Denigrate" Joe Biden ahead of the election. Driving the news: Blumenthal suggested in a Washington Post op-ed Saturday that Sen. Ron Johnson's investigation into Joe Biden and his son's activities in Ukraine may be laundering Russian disinformation, citing a report that Johnson had been provided with tapes by a Ukrainian lawmaker whose father was a KGB agent.
