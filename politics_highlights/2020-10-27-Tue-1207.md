If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, 'Let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination,'" [...] "And you could use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right."

Summary of [original article](https://www.kut.org/post/texas-currently-leading-nation-youth-voter-turnout):

> The state, overall, is leading the nation in voter turnout so far. "So, to see us leading voter turnout nationally across demographics, but specifically in the youth vote is really incredible." Correction: A previous version of this article said Tufts researchers' data only included youth voter turnout from 23 Texas counties.

> I hope young voters realize that once they start voting in large numbers consistently politicians will cater more towards them. They hold a lot of potential power, but they need to show up and wield it.

## Justice Kavanaugh Caught Cherry-Picking Line from a Law Review Article That Contradicted His Conclusion

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/awkward/justice-kavanaugh-caught-cherry-picking-line-from-a-law-review-article-that-contradicted-his-conclusion/):

> "The States are aware of the risks described by Professor Pildes: '[L]ate-arriving ballots open up one of the greatest risks of what might, in our era of hyperpolarized political parties and existential politics, destabilize the election result. If the apparent winner the morning after the election ends up losing due to late-arriving ballots, charges of a rigged election could explode,'" Kavanaugh wrote. Kavanaugh ruled AGAINST the six-day extension for Wisconsin to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day. "Justice Kavanaugh alleges that 'suspicions of impropriety' will result if 'absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,'" Sotomayor wrote in a footnote.
