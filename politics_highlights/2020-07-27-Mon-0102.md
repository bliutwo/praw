## Tom Cotton calls slavery 'necessary evil' in attack on New York Times' 1619 Project

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/tom-cotton-slavery-necessary-evil-1619-project-new-york-times):

> The Arkansas Republican senator Tom Cotton has called the enslavement of millions of African people "The necessary evil upon which the union was built". "The entire premise of the New York Times' factually, historically flawed 1619 Project is that America is at root, a systemically racist country to the core and irredeemable," Cotton told the Democrat-Gazette. Cotton responded: "More lies from the debunked 1619 Project. Describing the views of the Founders and how they put the evil institution on a path to extinction, a point frequently made by Lincoln, is not endorsing or justifying slavery. No surprise that the 1619 Project can't get facts right."
