> >Instructed not to use any of the half-dozen bathrooms inside the couple’s house, the Secret Service detail assigned to President Trump’s daughter and son-in-law spent months searching for a reliable restroom to use on the job, according to neighbors and law enforcement officials. After resorting to a porta-potty, as well as bathrooms at the nearby home of former president Barack Obama and the not-so-nearby residence of Vice President Pence, the agents finally found a toilet to call their own.

> >But it came at a cost to U.S. taxpayers. Since September 2017, the federal government has been spending $3,000 a month — more than $100,000 to date — to rent a basement studio, with a bathroom, from a neighbor of the Kushner family.

## Biden to put $2,000 stimulus payments back in play

Summary of [original article](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/01/14/politics/stimulus-payments-2000-dollars-biden/index.html):

> An economic package passed by Congress in December provided for fresh $600 stimulus payments despite calls from politicians on both sides of the aisle for bigger checks. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said that one of the first bills he'd like to pass once he becomes Senate majority leader would raise stimulus payments to $2,000. How much will recipients actually get? Those eligible for the stimulus payments may not get a new $2,000 payment.

`/u/kitchen_witch119` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kxd3gz/biden_to_put_2000_stimulus_payments_back_in_play/):

> "Those eligible for the stimulus payments may not get a new $2,000 payment. Instead, they may receive $1,400 that tops off the $600 payments that began going out earlier this month -- for a total of $2,000. In a letter to his Democratic colleagues sent this week, Schumer indicated that he is planning on payments that would increase the total payout to $2,000."
