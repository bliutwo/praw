## Democrat calls on Pentagon to strip Michael Flynn of his pension, calling him a ‘traitor’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-dod-michael-flynn-pension-b1960162.html):

> A prominent House Democrat and potential Senate candidate is urging the Pentagon to revoke former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn's military pension because of the retired army general's role in former president Donald Trump's effort to overturn results of the 2020 election. Mr Gallego noted the ex-general has made "Inflammatory and deeply troubling" statements in recent months which amounted to advocacy for a military coup, including comments revealed in a new book by ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl, which Mr Flynn made while actively urging Pentagon officials to order ballots seized and take other extralegal actions to prevent President Joe Biden from being declared the winner of the 2020 presidential contest. In June, an Army spokesperson said the Defence Department is "Aware" of statements made by Flynn advocating for a military coup, but said the department was "Not investigating these statements further" at the time.

## Sanders Says Deficit Concerns 'Seem to Melt Away' When It's Time to Fill Pentagon Coffers

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/11/18/sanders-says-deficit-concerns-seem-melt-away-when-its-time-fill-pentagon-coffers):

> Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted in a floor speech Wednesday that concerns about the deficit curiously disappear on Capitol Hill when it's time to authorize the Defense Department's annual budget, which lawmakers are preparing to boost to $778 billion for fiscal year 2022."All of this money is going to an agency, the Department of Defense, that continues to have massive cost overruns. "At a time when the scientists are telling us that we face an existential threat in terms of climate change, we are told that just don't have enough money to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and create a planet that will be healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations. "Concerns about the deficit seem to melt away under the influence of the military-industrial complex.

## Katie Porter decimates Louis DeJoy’s leadership of USPS with a sharpie

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/katie-porter-louis-dejoy-usps-b1958677.html):

> Democrat congresswoman Katie Porter has decimated Louis DeJoy for his leadership of the United States Postal Service amid concerning figures for "On time" deliveries. The appointment of the former Republican donor and businessman in itself caused consternation among Democrats before 2020's election and a mass of postal voting across the US. Ms Porter is a member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform which has been investigating declining delivery standards at USPS since Mr DeJoy's appointment. On Twitter, she was widely championed for "Whiteboarding" Mr Dejoy, with fellow Democrat Bill Pascrell, Jr writing: "As usual Rep Katie Porter hits the nail on the head. The Post Office delays are disgraceful and louis dejoy and his enablers on the postal board all need to be fired."

## Judge Rejects Bannon Attempt to Push Contempt of Congress Hearing Into New Year

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannons-attempt-to-push-jan-6-committee-contempt-hearing-into-new-year-is-rejected-by-judge-judge):

> Trump-appointed federal Judge Carl Nichols slapped down ex-White House strategist Steve Bannon's request to put off his next court appearance on contempt of Congress charges until January-even as he also declined the prosecution's request that he set dates for a trial. Bannon phoned in his appearance in Nichols' D.C. courtroom on Thursday, a day after he pleaded not guilty to allegations he illegally refused to cooperate with the House committee probing the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Citing the need to collect these documents, the COVID-19 pandemic, the backlog of Jan. 6-related prosecutions, and the civil suit ex-President Donald Trump brought against Jan. 6 committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, Corcoran argued that the court should kick the next court appearance into early 2022.
