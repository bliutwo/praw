## Updates to Our Rule Against Harm

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pemm7d/updates_to_our_rule_against_harm/):

> We have recently updated our rule against harm which we believe will help users better understand how we have enforced this rule. Politics is a messy and controversial subject, but that does not mean it is acceptable to cheer on harm against people you disagree with. We have specifically chosen to include this language as part of our harm rule to limit its scope.

> California: More polls came out showing Newsom will not get recalled. Hopefully everyone votes, the Texas thing might mobilize a lot of people and bring attention to what would happen if we get a Republican governor, they might even have the power to designate a Republican senator and shift control of the Senate. One more week until the election...

## The Supreme Court's Texas abortion decision is a threat to constitutional rights (all of them)

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/571003-the-supreme-courts-texas-abortion-decision-is-a-threat-to-constitutional):

> Abortion opponents are jubilant about the Supreme Court's recent refusal to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks. If, say, a state made it a crime to praise the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a court would quickly block it as a flagrant violation of First Amendment free speech. The Supreme Court may well be about to overrule Roe v. Wade and abandon constitutional protection of abortion.

`/u/Msdamgoode` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pjkw6c/the_supreme_courts_texas_abortion_decision_is_a/):

> *”This trick will work with any contested constitutional right. Suppose Texas had thought of it in the 1950s, when it was defending segregated schools. “Any private citizen can sue any black child who seeks to attend an integrated school, or who aids and abets such a child . . .” Before Brown v. Board of Education settled the question in 1954, most Southern courts would not have been inclined to dismiss such lawsuits, and the NAACP would have faced bankruptcy if it persisted in its campaign against legal racism.”*
> 
> This is a terrifying article, and a horrifying decision by the court to let it stand. Democracy is being torn apart by the people who are responsible for defending it.

## GOP Lawmakers Sent Threatening Letter To Wrong CEO To Thwart Jan. 6 Probe

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jan-6-house-select-committee-gop-threatens-businesses_n_6136d108e4b0aac9c01abe70):

> Eleven Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Yahoo urging the company not to cooperate with a House investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection, except they addressed it to a CEO who left more than four years ago. Mo Brooks, Madison Cawthorn, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar and Lauren Boebert, sent letters to 13 businesses telling them not to comply with requests from the House select committee investigating the events of Jan. 6. CREW President Noah Bookbinder said in a statement that McCarthy and Greene were "Transparently trying to thwart the select committee by illegally threatening companies with reprisals if they comply with the committee's proper and lawful requests - quite possibly to protect themselves."

## The Satanic Temple challenges new Texas abortion law citing religious freedom

`/u/NoisyN1nja` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pjep7j/the_satanic_temple_challenges_new_texas_abortion/):

> From [thesatanictemple.com](https://thesatanictemple.com)
> 
> > The Satanic Temple stands ready to assist any member that shares its deeply-held religious convictions regarding the right to reproductive freedom. Accordingly, we encourage any member who resides in Texas and wishes to undergo the Satanic Abortion Ritual within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy to contact The Satanic Temple so we may help them fight this law directly. S.B. 8 does not allow for lawsuits or enforcement of penalties against a woman seeking an abortion. Instead, S.B. 8 is cynically designed to avoid judicial review of the law and creates enforcement mechanisms against TST and its lawyers who dare challenge the law. We will not be cowed into silence by an unjust law or a tyrannical state government.
> 
> >LEGAL PROCEDURE AND JUSTIFICATION
> The Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (TRFRA) provides a mechanism to seek an exemption from any law that restricts the free exercise of religion. Because S.B. 8 imposes an undue burden on the ability of TST members to undergo the Satanic Abortion Ritual, the first step in defending the rights of its members is to seek an exemption under TRFRA. If the state declines to provide such an exemption, TST can then seek judicial relief from the law.

## UN Human Rights Experts: Texas Abortion Ban Is a Violation of International Law

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/09/07/un-human-rights-experts-texas-abortion-ban-violation-international-law):

> United Nations experts tasked with monitoring human rights abuses across the globe are condemning Texas' near-total abortion ban as a clear violation of international law, characterizing the state's newly imposed restrictions as "profoundly discriminatory" and dangerous. "This new law will make abortion unsafe and deadly, and create a whole new set of risks for women and girls," said Upreti, who argued that the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to block the Texas ban "has taken the entire country backward" on reproductive rights, potentially imperiling abortion access throughout much of the nation. The U.N. experts' comments on the Texas abortion ban came after U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Monday that the Department of Justice is exploring "all options to challenge Texas S.B. 8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons, including access to an abortion.

`/u/ReadTheSources` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pjmif2/un_human_rights_experts_texas_abortion_ban_is_a/):

> The US has been officially condemned by the International Criminal Courts on multiple occasions for flouting international law. Turns out, we're not signatories to The Rome Statute that would make such things enforceable. So while this is a nice thing for context about international norms, it's mostly just informational. "Hey, if you had agreed to the ICC, you'd be in trouble right now," is all this amounts to. Obviously we don't care about perception, hearts or minds at this point...only ratcheting up suffering on anyone who isn't a white, Christian extremist.

## Portland to declare trade and travel ban against Texas

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/changing-america/resilience/smart-cities/571042-portland-to-declare-trade-and-travel-ban-against):

> Portland will be voting on an emergency resolution Wednesday that would ban trading with Texas and bar city employees from traveling to the state as a direct response to the state's new abortion law. "While the Justice Department urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons, including access to an abortion," Garland said in a statement. "We will continue to protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services pursuant to our criminal and civil enforcement of the FACE Act. We will not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services, physical obstruction or property damage".

> I wonder if any professional sport teams will be moving out. That would reverse laws in Texas.
