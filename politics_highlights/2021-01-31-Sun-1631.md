## ‘We traffic in lies’: A House Republican launches campaign to ‘take back our party’

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-31/we-traffic-in-lies-a-house-republican-launches-campaign-to-take-back-our-party):

> As the Republican Party wrestles with its identity in the wake of former President Trump, an Illinois Republican is out to prove there is a GOP voter base that wants to give up the division and conspiracy theories that he says have come to define the party. "But we'd be bringing in that Republican who maybe voted Biden and then Republican down-ballot because they couldn't stand Donald Trump but they gave the Republican Party one last shot." On Wednesday, House Republicans will hold a discussion and potential vote on whether Cheney, who like Kinzinger also strongly opposed Trump's effort to overturn the election results and supported his impeachment, should remain as chairwoman of the Republican conference.

## McConnell adviser says GOP should cut ties with Marjorie Taylor Greene to make her ‘most useless congressperson’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mcconnell-marjorie-taylor-greene-scott-jennings-b1795478.html):

> Kicking Ms Greene out of the House GOP conference over her right-wing conspiracy theories and past threats against Democratic lawmakers would leave her without any committee assignments, where members typically perform most of their work. Mr Jennings, the former McConnell aide and GOP commentator, said on Sunday it's members like Ms Greene who have rendered the Republican party a "Minority party." "What I cannot do is continue to look over my shoulder wondering if a white supremacist in Congress, by the name of Marjorie Taylor Greene is conspiring against us," she said.

## Sanders says Democrats have the votes to pass another relief bill

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/536662-sanders-says-democrats-have-the-votes-to-pass-another-relief-bill):

> Sen. on Sunday said that he believed Senate Democrats have the votes to pass another COVID-19 relief package. In an appearance on ABC's "This Week," he was asked by host Martha Raddatz if he believed Democrats had enough votes as bipartisan support for a relief bill appears to dwindle. President Biden has stated that he would like to have bipartisan support for the relief bill, but has emphasized that a relief bill must be passed "No if, ands or butts."

> >“Look, all of us will have differences of opinion. This is a $1.9 trillion bill. I have differences and concerns about this bill,” Sanders said. 
> 
> >“But at the end of the day, we're going to support the President of the United States, and we're going to come forward, and we're going to do what the American people overwhelmingly want us to do. The polling is overwhelming. Republicans, Democrats, independents,”
> 
> Bernie is right. It polls very well so who cares if it's bipartisan. In the end, people will remember who tried to help them and who didn't.

## Opinion: Republicans should police their own, then we can talk unity

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/31/police-their-own-then-we-can-talk-unity/):

> The Republican Accountability Project is running a billboard campaign urging certain Republicans - Sens. Two directors of the project, Elizabeth Neumann and Olivia Troye, wrote in USA Today, "Republicans leaders are suddenly preaching the importance of unity and healing. The first step toward recovery is repentance and accepting responsibility for their role. There can be no unity without truth and accountability." Neumann and Troye promised to support the 10 House Republicans who refused to overturn the election. Second, a nationwide voter registration effort may help organic movements we have seen in Arizona, for example, where some 10,000 Republicans changed parties.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is one of just ten Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the insurrectionist mob that attack the US Capitol on January 6. The lawmaker, who has been in Congress since 2013, tried to warn the GOP of the pernicious influence of the QAnon conspiracy theory, many months before Trump supporters stormed the building.
