## Joe Biden congratulated by Russian opposition leader, not by Vladimir Putin

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-congratulated-russian-opposition-leader-not-vladimir-putin-1545879):

> Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his win, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not yet shared any congratulatory remarks. While many world leaders have congratulated Biden and Harris, Putin has not. Biden said in a statement posted to his campaign website: "Once again, the Kremlin has used a favorite weapon-an agent from the Novichok class of chemicals-in an effort to silence a political opponent. The mode of attack leaves no doubt as to where the responsibility lies-the Russian state. This outrageous and brazen attempt on Mr. Navalny's life is just the latest incident in a long history of murder and poisoning of dissidents, investigative journalists, anti-corruption activists, and opposition leaders under the Putin regime."

## Georgia Judge Throws Out Trump Campaign Lawsuit That Produced Exactly Zero Evidence of Fraud

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/awkward/georgia-judge-throws-out-trump-campaign-lawsuit-that-produced-exactly-zero-evidence-of-fraud):

> The day after filing a petition, the Trump campaign lost an election lawsuit in Georgia on Thursday after two witnesses called by Republicans admitted under oath that they did not know whether the challenged ballots were received on time. Late on Wednesday, the Georgia Republican Party joined forces with the Trump campaign in a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Chatham County in Georgia. "Failing to ensure that absentee ballots received after the deadline are stored in a manner to ensure that such ballots are not inadvertently or intentionally counted, as required under Georgia law, harms the interests of the Trump Campaign and President Trump because it could lead to the dilution of legal votes cast in support of President Trump," the complaint claimed.

> If the Election is a fraud,l does it mean we can overturn Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell's victories as well? 
> 
> How come the sole fraud was for Democrats? I don't get how anyone in America buys into the argument Donald Trump and the conservative media machine is creating. They don't have facts, their "witnesses" are tainted, Donald Trump already has a history of making these kind of accusations which imply he was planning it all along in case he lost. Am I crazy or has America gone cuckoo?
