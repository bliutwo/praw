## Friday Fun Thread

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idz8gx/friday_fun_thread/):

> It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some lychee juice, argue about which Q4 2020 game will be best, and talk about what's going on in your life. As always remember to follow our civility rules and save any meta feedback for our modmail. Please do not post anything directly related to politics in the Friday Fun Thread. We'd like these threads to be a refuge from the often-stressful political cycle.

> The number of comments I've *almost* posted is far greater than the number of comments I have actually made. 
> 
> Padres have now hit a grand slam four games in a row.  Lucky but still impressive.

## I’m Grace Panetta, a politics reporter at Business Insider covering voting in the era of COVID-19, the current state of the US Postal Service, and how the United States’ elections are working in 2020. AMA!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idzm9p/im_grace_panetta_a_politics_reporter_at_business/):

> Hi Reddit! My name is (v), and I've been following and reporting on election administration and voting in the US during this pandemic since March. Our decentralized and complex election system can be really confusing, especially to those of you who are just now starting to follow this story and worrying about whether your vote will count. I'm here to answer all your questions about your vote, what the new changes at the Postal Service really mean, and what to expect about this November's election.

`/u/jojackmcgurk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idzm9p/im_grace_panetta_a_politics_reporter_at_business/):

> Trump is trying to obstruct the right to vote through his man at the Post Office. He has admitted this, out loud. Why aren't reporters holding his feet to the fire every second of every day about how he is breaking the law and his oath?
> 
> That's my question. The 4th estate is letting him get away scott free, reporting heinous crimes and forgetting them with the following news cycle. Tell me why he isn't being accused of breaking the law and being called a liar at every news conference. 
> 
> Until you can do that, I really don't care much about an explanation of how to get my vote to count through this mind boggling suppression.
> 
> Edit: YOUR OWN PUBLICATION reported Trump wants to send sheriffs to polling locations. That's not legal. Where is the intrepid reporter telling that to the man's face and laughing off his inane reply? You should be ripping the man to pieces, not explaining how to get around all these ridiculous new "rules and situations"

## Should a Joe Biden DOJ Investigate and Prosecute Donald Trump?

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/should-biden-prosecute-trump-michelle-goldberg-mike-pesca-debate.html):

> I don't think it should be a chant at Joe Biden events, if there were public Joe Biden events. I think, in the specific, there are exceptions to the rules of not prosecuting the predecessor, and I think Donald Trump very well might be the exception. As much as I think that Trump, in a lot of ways, is a product of trends that have been going on in the Republican Party and the conservative movement for a long time, I also think that there should be a way to mark if we can-you know, inshallah-these four years as abhorrent and turn Trumpism into an epithet for the foreseeable future.

## DeJoy Says USPS Won’t Reinstall More Than 600 Removed Mail Sorting Machines “There’s no intention to do that,” DeJoy testified. “They’re not needed.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/08/dejoy-says-usps-wont-reinstall-more-than-600-removed-mail-sorting-machines/):

> Embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before the US Senate on Friday that he will not reinstall more than 600 mail sorting machines that have been removed under his leadership. "Will you be bringing back any mail sorting machines that have been removed?" Sen. Gary Peters asked DeJoy during a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee. USPS plants were ordered to remove 671 mail sorting machines that can efficiently process thousands of pieces of mail by the end of September.

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idy15r/dejoy_says_usps_wont_reinstall_more_than_600/):

> >	Many of the machines have been removed in critical swing states: 59 in Florida, 58 in Texas, 34 in Ohio, 30 in Pennsylvania, 26 in Michigan, 15 in North Carolina, 12 in Virginia, 12 in Wisconsin, and 11 in Georgia.
> 
> I’m sure the fact that ~~the majority~~ many of them are in swing states is just a coincidence.
> 
> Edit: [Here is a more detailed report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/20/postal-service-mail-sorters-removals/) of where these reductions in sorting capacity can be found.

## Susan Collins helped cripple the USPS: Now Maine farmers are getting dead baby chicks in the mail

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/21/susan-collins-helped-cripple-the-usps-now-maine-farmers-are-getting-dead-baby-chicks-in-the-mail/):

> Sen. Susan Collins "Ultimately, that law is responsible for how we got to where we're at," a postal union leader tells Salon. Maine farmers have blamed recent changes at the U.S. Postal Service after receiving thousands of dead baby chicks due to shipping delays. "If people cannot depend on the Postal Service for prompt delivery of mail or packages, it will only further hurt the Postal Service's financial situation," Collins said.

`/u/BigBennP` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idusux/susan_collins_helped_cripple_the_usps_now_maine/):

> This is important because FedEx and the like simply will not ship live animals due to liability issues.   If you need to ship live animals, it's either an expensive private transport (like you might get for a pet dog) or the post office. 
> 
> I've gotten chicks in the mail more than a few times. Usually 1-2 come dead but baby chicks are fragile they need about 100f heat, but can die if it gets too hot. Usually they go in boxes a day after hatching. They don't need food for the first  day or two but need food and water after thay. It's  not unheard of in really hot or cold weather to have an entire batch get killed due to transport conditions, but the article says over 4000 have arrived dead which is really unprecedented.   Its also easily explainable if the box simply sat in a processing center for 2-3 days where they didn't have heat or water.

> >	Williams, the former vice chairman of the USPS Board of Governors with decades of federal government experience, testified to the Congressional Progressive Caucus that what he witnessed in his final months at the Postal Service was unprecedented, detailing how Mnuchin required members of the supposedly independent board to **”come to his office to kiss the ring and receive his blessing before confirmation” and made “illegal” demands of officials.**
> 
> Mnuchin needs investigated. This is mobster behavior. Another Trump crony that deserves to be behind bars.
