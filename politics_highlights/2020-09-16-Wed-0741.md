## A Black voter asked Trump if he knows how 'tone deaf' his MAGA slogan sounds to the African American community

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/black-voter-tells-trump-maga-slogan-is-tone-deaf-2020-9):

> A Black voter during a town hall event pressed President Donald Trump on his 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan, which he said said was "Tone deaf." Trump, whom critics say is running the an openly racist re-election campaign, responded that he has "Tremendous" support from Black Americans. In his new White House exposé, called "Rage," Bob Woodward writes that when he asked Trump whether he had a responsibility to "Understand the anger and pain" felt by Black Americans the president responded with incredulity, telling Woodward "You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you?".

> 
> Damn, he cut right through to the bones of MAGA. Take fucking note, he's right, MAGA refers to a time when violent white Christians held all the power.

## Trump Blames Biden, Who Isn't President, For Not Instituting Mask Mandate | “To be clear: I am not currently president,” Biden wrote moments later. “But if you chip in now, we can change that.”

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f617ac9c5b68d1b09c9541a?ncid=APPLENEWS00001):

> President Donald Trump moved to blame his Democratic competitor, former Vice President Joe Biden, for not instituting a national mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic. The Democratic candidate is also not the president and has no authority to mandate anything. Julie Bart asked the president why he hadn't instituted a national mask mandate during the height of the pandemic and why he had largely refused to wear facial coverings even as the nation's top medical officials urged the public to do so.

> Trump administration Turned Down Offer To Manufacture Millions Of N95 Masks As Coronavirus Spread--After the first COVID-19 case was detected in January, a company offered to make millions of N95 masks. A federal agency said no. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-turned-down-offer-n95-masks-coronavirus_n_5eb6e016c5b64711c0c8cafa
> 
> But in 2018--The Trump administration failed to move forward with an Obama-era plan to make millions of protective masks for healthcare workers, according to The Washington Post. A 2015 contract with medical manufacturer O&M Halyard called for the creation of a “one-of-a-kind, high-speed machine” that could hopefully produce at least 1.5 million N95 masks per day, to resolve the kind of protective equipment shortfall plaguing clinics and hospitals today. A Halyard employee told The Post the design was delivered on time and in-budget in 2018. But the machine was never created. An HHS spokesperson told the paper that no funding was available to build it, though The Post reports that the department responsible for the project had a nearly $1.5 billion budget https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-ducked-massive-mask-manufacturing-plan-wapo-reports

## 'Why Is He Trying So Hard to Keep It a Secret?' Postal Service Sued Over Refusal to Release DeJoy Calendar

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/09/16/why-he-trying-so-hard-keep-it-secret-postal-service-sued-over-refusal-release-dejoy):

> Government watchdog group American Oversight filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday over its refusal to turn over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's calendar in response to a Freedom of Information request, stonewalling that the nonpartisan organization said could indicate the USPS chief has something to hide. In response to the Postal Service's claim that DeJoy's calendar was "Created for his personal use" and "Not intended to be an official record of his schedule," American Oversight said the "Postmaster general's calendar is composed of agency records" and thus subject to FOIA requests. American Oversight's filing comes two weeks after the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed DeJoy for a number of documents, including his "Complete, unredacted calendar from June 15, 2020 to the present." The deadline for DeJoy to comply with the panel's subpoena is noon Wednesday.
