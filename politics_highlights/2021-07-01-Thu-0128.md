## Republican who rejected bipartisan riot commission complains special committee is not bipartisan

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/michelle-fischbach-capitol-riot-commission-b1875792.html):

> After congressional Republicans widely rejected a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol riot, US Rep Michelle Fischbach claimed that "Democrats refuse to put together a truly bipartisan commission" - after she voted against the bipartisan attempt from both Democrats and Republicans. House Democrats are moving forward with a select committee after Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan probe into the events surrounding the 6 January riot and its aftermath, after a mob fuelled by Donald Trump's baseless narrative that the 2020 presidential election was "Stolen" from him stormed the halls of Congress to overturn the votes of millions of Americans. The bipartisan effort led by Republican Rep John Katko with Democratic Rep Bennie Thompson proposed a 10-person commission, with each party getting an equal number of members and subpoena power, similarly modelled after the congressional commission that followed the 11 September terror attacks.

Rated by a group of over 140 historians, the survey ranks former U.S. presidents on 10 different leadership qualities, such as "Public persuasion," "International relations" and "Crisis leadership." Since 2000, C-SPAN has taken the survey after every change in White House administration. The historians rated Trump as the worst president in history on two of 10 leadership qualities: "Moral authority" and "Administrative skills." His strongest grade is for "Public persuasion," in which he was ranked No. 32.

> It’s proof that our education system has failed. The majority of people I have met struggle with basic algebra, have no real historical perspective for current events, are ignorant of basic human anatomy, and make elementary school English mistakes. For fucks sakes every few years someone plays the dihydrogen monoxide prank and it always works better than it should.
