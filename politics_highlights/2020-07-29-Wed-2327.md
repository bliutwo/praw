## We're from the Fair Elections Center, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Campus Vote Project, here to discuss the critical need for Americans to serve as poll workers this year. Ask us anything about how to get involved and the impact your service can have on supporting our democracy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzhw6c/were_from_the_fair_elections_center_the_us/):

> Fair Elections Center developed WorkElections.com, a website that compiles poll worker requirements and application links for thousands of jurisdictions in states across the country. The current pandemic has dramatically reduced the traditional pool of poll workers - many of whom are older - and created an urgent need for recruiting a new workforce to ensure adequate staffing at the polls this fall. A shortage of poll workers could mean closure of polling places and longer lines to vote.

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Two-Texas-Republicans-test-positive-for-COVID-19-15443819.php):

> Two Texas Republicans headed to join President Donald Trump during his trip to Midland on Wednesday were forced to back out after testing positive for the coronavirus. Gohmert is at least the 10th member of Congress known to have tested positive for the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. In his video statement, Gohmert claimed he was wearing his mask: "It was a couple of the other guys not wearing a mask."

## Fauci: Hydroxychloroquine 'Is Not Effective' In Treating COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fauci-hydroxychloroquine-is-not-effective_n_5f2197f3c5b6b8cd63b0c530):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci has again stressed the determinations by health officials that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in combatting the coronavirus after President Donald Trump continued to baselessly endorse its use this week. "If a study that's a good study comes out and shows efficacy and safety for hydroxychloroquine or any other drug that we do, if you do it in the right way, you accept the scientific data," said Fauci, a key member of Trump's Coronavirus Task Force. For the most part, in making his case he has relied on anecdotes about hydroxychloroquine rather than the type of tests Fauci referred to.

## Column: In GOP plan, you can’t sue your employers for giving you COVID — but they can sue you

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-29/covid-employer-liability):

> If you were looking for evidence that Republicans in Congress have no sympathy for workers facing illness or worse from the coronavirus pandemic, look past the party's proposal to cut unemployment benefits. The GOP proposal would erect almost insurmountable obstacles to lawsuits by workers who become infected with the coronavirus at their workplaces. In a surfeit of irony, or perhaps cynicism, the GOP titled its measure the "Safeguarding America's Frontline Employees To Offer Work Opportunities Required to Kickstart the Economy Act," or the "SAFE TO WORK Act.".
