> >	But, after Yoho’s non-apology, Ocasio-Cortez decided not to let this go. As she explained in her speech, she’s encountered language like Yoho’s a million times before. “[T]his is not new, and that is the problem. This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural. It is a culture … accepting of violence and violent language against women, and an entire structure of power that supports that.” She went on to criticize Yoho for using his daughters as a shield; “I am someone’s daughter too.”
> 
> She’s never afraid of standing up to men like this and calling them out for their bullshit.

## Trump's Use of Federal Paramilitaries Is a Classic Tactic of Autocrats to Test How Far They Can Push Their Authority

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/07/25/trumps-use-federal-paramilitaries-classic-tactic-autocrats-test-how-far-they-can):

> Trump and his strategists are very consciously pitting states against each other in a replay of the pre-Civil War conflict over federal authority. Of course, the analogy is complicated by the fact that Trump is the head of the federal system. Trump's use of federal paramilitaries is a classic tactic of autocrats to test how far they can push their authority and what forces they can count on in an emergency.

>  It’s important to remember that both DHS and CBP are functioning under "acting" heads, who have not been confirmed by the Senate, and who have stayed on past the mandated limits of their terms. They are answerable to no one but the president\*
> 
> The president\* is giving a big ol’ middle finger to our Constitution and our entire legal system, and the same Senate republicans who have enabled him at every turn are the only ones who can check his power prior to the election.

## Why the Superrich Keep Getting Richer. Billionaires like Jeff Bezos aren’t obscenely wealthy because they work harder than everyone else or they’re more innovative. They’re obscenely wealthy because their corporate empires drain society’s resources — and we’d all be better off without them.

Summary of [original article](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/07/superrich-amazon-jeff-bezos-trillionaire):

> The monetization of this data is what generates most of Amazon's returns: Amazon Web Services is the most profitable part of the business by some distance. Far from representing its social utility, Amazon's market value - and Bezos' personal wealth - reflects its market power. The extreme inequalities generated by modern capitalism are making obvious something that Marxists have known for decades: the superrich generate their wealth at the expense of workers, the planet, and society as a whole.

`/u/drshooter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hxnygx/why_the_superrich_keep_getting_richer/):

> A much more aggressive anti trust policy must be put in place.  These mega corporations will swallow up our democracy if we don’t put a stop to them.

## Op-Ed: Trump's troops in Portland are a constitutional outrage

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-24/donald-trump-portland-border-patrol-constitution):

> One of the most basic principles of our system of law is that for the federal government, including the president, to take an action, there must be constitutional and statutory authority. Trump can invoke authority under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows presidents to send troops when "Any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy" prevents enforcement of state laws in a manner that deprives residents of that state of their federal constitutional rights. The Trump administration claims that the border patrol is in Portland on just such a mission - protecting federal property, including a courthouse.

> >In Portland, it appears that individuals have been arrested who were engaged in peaceful protests and not breaking any law.  
> >  
> >As to the Fourth Amendment, in news reports, protesters in Portland  describe being put into unmarked police cars by officers who did not  identify themselves, being detained in the federal building and then  released. These are arrests without probable cause, violations of the  amendment’s guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure.
> 
> The Gestapo of Nazi Germany did that. The Stazi in East Germany did that. The Chinese have secret police that do that.
> 
> The right in tolerating this and supporting it is basically taking the  American flag that they proclaim to love so much and shitting on it,  then peeing on it and then burning it using cow dung for fuel.

## United Nations calls on US police to halt use of force against journalists covering protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/united-nations-journalism-protests-portland-oregon-donald-trump-press-freedom-a9637046.html):

> Journalists covering protests in the United States should be permitted to do their jobs without fear of attack or arrest, the United Nations human rights office said on Friday. Her comments come after weeks of US authorities attacking and arresting the journalists who are covering the historic racial protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. On Thursday, a judge in Portland barred federal law enforcement officers from arresting or using physical force against journalists and legal observers attending the protests if they were not committing any crimes.
