> Thinking these people are "observing" in good faith to begin with is a mistake.  They're posing as independents, they're objecting to things that they have no idea about, it's just peak Trumpism.  Sit there, shut up, wear a mask, and then get the fuck out.

## Impeach the president again — Removal from office wouldn’t be the goal this time. It would be to prevent Trump from running again.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/21/opinion/impeach-president-again/):

> While it sounds almost bizarre to make such a suggestion when the president's term is over in two months, the move would have a useful byproduct: The Senate could prevent Trump from running again in 2024.The impeachment clause of the Constitution allows the Senate to impose two possible punishments: "Removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States." While two-thirds of the Senate is required for removal from office in an impeachment trial, precedents involving the impeachment of judges indicate that only a majority vote would be required to make the penalty a disqualification from future office. In other words, the House of Representatives could impeach Trump before his term ends, and the Senate could take up the matter after he leaves office. While congressional Republicans may have benefited in this election from having Trump on the ticket, the grievances he is nursing will likely be used to justify another run for office in four years, which means that Trump's hold over the GOP will not end on Jan. 20.

> A Federal Penitentiary could prevent Trump from running again.

## AOC Attacks Double Standard After Accused Kenosha Shooter Rittenhouse's Release: 'Law and Disorder'

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-attacks-double-standard-after-accused-kenosha-shooter-rittenhouses-release-law-disorder-1549264):

> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized a double standard within the criminal justice system after accused Rittenhouse was released from jail on Friday. "It's amazing how these people like Ricky Schroder & Mike Lindell will proclaim to be pro-life, but turn around & bail out Kyle Rittenhouse who allegedly murdered two people advocating for Black people not being killed by cops. A true showcase in pure racism!" she tweeted on Friday. Rittenhouse had been in jail for two months before his release on Friday.

> > People who argue that dramatic changes to policing, including budgetary ones, will mean “violent people will be let out of jail to roam free” rarely ever acknowledge that’s actually the current system we have today for the privileged
> 
> -----
> 
> > Does anyone believe Rittenhouse would be released if he were Muslim & did the same thing in a diff context? For people who say “systemic racism doesn’t exist,” this is what it looks like: protection of white supremacy baked deep into our carceral systems.

> A bipartisan group of Georgia teens is trying to flip the Senate by enlisting thousands of students to vote in the January runoffs. About 23,000 Georgia teens who were not eligible to vote in the general election on November 3 will turn 18 and become eligible in time to participate in the Georgia runoff elections on January 5, according to The Civics Center, a nonprofit dedicated to youth civic engagement. "I don't want to text people. I don't want to run social media ads. I want to have real conversations with real voters," Aguilar said.
