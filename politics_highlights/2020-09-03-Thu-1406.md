## I am William D Hughes, Democratic candidate for Representative of Georgia House District 21 around Holly Springs - AMA

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ilv4mn/i_am_william_d_hughes_democratic_candidate_for/):

> Like a lot of people who discuss politics energetically, I had. I replied, "Yes," and went to meet with leaders from Cherokee County Democrats and the Democratic Party of Georgia, and we determined that I should run for Representative in the Georgia Assembly, House District 21. This district has been a Republican stronghold for a long time, but we believe that it's possible to win due to the current challenges facing Georgia such as the coronavirus pandemic, the equality protests spurred by the murders of Georgia Floyd and Breonna Taylor nationally, as well as the murders of Ahmaud Arbery by racists and Rayshard Brooks by police in Georgia, and the focus on civil rights brought about by the loss of one of the greatest Georgia political leaders, John Lewis. My commitment in this campaign is to focus on the people of House District 21 first, followed by the people of Georgia, and that's it.

> This is why I strongly believe that every state should have guidelines about postmark in addition to received date.
> 
> I know in some places, as long as a ballot is postmarked by election day (and arrives before a very final deadline weeks out), it will be counted. But in others, the ballot must arrive on or before election date. With the current delays in USPS, it seems important to say that as long as a ballot is postmarked by election day, it will count. (An alternative that's less good but better than nothing is a policy that if a ballot is postmarked by a date where it ought to be received by election day, say, by October 30th, then it will count, even if it is received after election day.)

## Trump may have "committed a felony" by telling supporters to commit voter fraud: "Do NOT vote twice"

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/09/03/trump-may-have-committed-a-felony-by-telling-supporters-to-commit-voter-fraud-do-not-vote-twice/):

> Attorney General Bill Barr defended President Donald Trump urging supporters to illegally vote twice in North Carolina even as a top Democratic lawyer argued that his comments constituted a "Felony." Trump traveled to North Carolina on Wednesday, where he told supporters to test the voting system by casting a mail ballot and then voting in person on Election Day, which The New York Times noted is an "Act that constitutes the kind of voter fraud the president has railed against." North Carolina election law says that it is illegal for "Any person with intent to commit a fraud to register or vote at more than one precinct or more than one time, or to induce another to do so, in the same primary or election, or to vote illegally at any primary or election."

`/u/SadDreamofReality` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/iluegu/trump_may_have_committed_a_felony_by_telling/):

> There's no "may". Trump directly encouraged people to commit electoral fraud, which in and of itself is a felony.

## North Carolina State Board of Elections says of Trump comments: 'It is illegal to vote twice'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/514965-north-carolina-state-board-of-elections-after-trump-comments-it-is-illegal):

> The North Carolina State Board of Elections reminded voters that it is illegal to cast a ballot twice after encouraged people in the state to vote both by mail and in person. "Attempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law." "Also, the State Board conducts audits after each election that check voter history against ballots cast and would detect if someone tries to vote more than once in an election. Because absentee ballots and early voting ballots are retrievable, if someone tries to get around the system, their ballot can be retrieved and not counted, so it will not affect the outcome of an election," she added, noting that cases could be referred to prosecutors in cases of double voting.

> So the president just urged people to commit a felony to, you know, "see what happens"?

## Attorney General Barr incorrectly claims Jacob Blake was 'armed' when he was shot by police

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/attorney-general-william-bar-jacob-blake-armed-police-shooting-a9703971.html):

> The attorney general attempted to draw distinctions between the police killings of George Floyd and Mr Blake. Though Mr Blake did have a knife in his car, there is no evidence available that supports the claim that he was armed or suggests that his intention was to grab his knife and use it against police officers. "Attorney General Barr is misinformed. The police officers were the aggressors from start to finish, based on video and witness accounts," they said.

## Chris Wallace, Trump’s Least Favorite Fox News Anchor, Will Moderate First Presidential Debate

Summary of [original article](https://www.vogue.com/article/chris-wallace-presidential-debate-2020-fox-news-donald-trump):

> The Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, whose tough grilling of Donald Trump in a one-hour interview last month was must-see TV, has been named as one of the moderators of the three presidential debates this fall, along with Steve Scully, the political editor of C-Span, and Kristen Welker, the White House correspondent for NBC News. In 2016, when he presided over the third debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Wallace, the son of broadcasting legend Mike Wallace, was the first anchor from Fox News ever to moderate a presidential debate. Wallace "Delivered a sterling performance," said CNN, "Focusing on substantive issues that matter to American voters." The New Yorker's then TV critic Emily Nussbaum tweeted, "Gotta say, Chris Wallace is a pro. Cool demeanor, asking clear follow-ups." The New York Times columnist Bret Stephens tweeted near the debate's close, "So far the winner of this debate is Chris Wallace." Even the author Stephen King weighed in, tweeting, "Chris Wallace did a good job. Taking no shit, like a veteran teacher monitoring detention hall."

> If it has to be a Fox anchor I'm glad it's Wallace. Wallace has humiliated Trump during interviews before and actually called him out on his bullshit. I suspect hes a big reason why Trump keeps threatening fox news these days and pushing OAN.
