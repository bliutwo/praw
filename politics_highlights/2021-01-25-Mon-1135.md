## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 4

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l4rvcw/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate news about Trump, Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Louisiana: A toddler had a Morris Bart themed birthday party. There was a 60 day ban on new oil and gas permits for the gulf of Mexico. The state is also still collectively coping with losing Drew Brees to retirement. We are also wondering why we don't have crawfish flavored potato chips only crawfish boil flavored potato chips.

## The Justice System Is Going Too Easy on the White Insurrectionists

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/white-supremacist-prosecution/):

> We're supposed to believe "The system" is too busy to hold accountable 800 or so white insurrectionists? What, are we worried the FBI is going to run out of organic meals to feed these people too? There cannot be two systems of justice: one for people of color, like the man charged and convicted of felony murder after the Benghazi attacks even though he was only the lookout, and another for a mob of white insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol and killed a cop. I have hope that Biden will appoint prosecutors who believe that prosecuting white people is part of their job, not figuring out excuses to let white people get away with violence.

`/u/Scarlettail` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l4q71x/the_justice_system_is_going_too_easy_on_the_white/):

> There seems to be this sense, as time passes, that the event was just happenstance or no big deal really. There just doesn't seem to be a serious will among much of the country, particularly anyone right-leaning, to do much about it. "It was just a little coup attempt, who cares?"
> 
> It's also tough to get justice when 40% or more of the country supports Trump and the insurrectionists. Obviously that means there will be supporters in the justice system itself. Justice is by no means impartial, unfortunately. This is scary, of course, since it means another event like this could break the country apart.

## Trump is furiously watching Fauci give interviews about how relieved he is to be working for Biden, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-furiously-watching-fauci-biden-era-interviews-report-2021-1):

> Former President Donald Trump has been obsessively and furiously watching Dr. Anthony Fauci's TV interviews since President Joe Biden took office, The Daily Beast reported on Sunday, citing sources. While Fauci wasn't afraid of contradicting Trump's misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, he stopped short of directly criticizing Trump when he was president or talking about the politics of the coronavirus task force. The Daily Beast, citing two sources, reported that Trump had been closely watching Fauci's media tour from his new home at Mar-a-Lago, whining about how "Incompetent" Fauci was and how he should have fired the infectious-disease expert when he had the chance.

`/u/Kikiboo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l4romn/trump_is_furiously_watching_fauci_give_interviews/):

> >"He very much feels that a lot of people are working to downgrade his legacy out of hatred for him," one source told The Daily Beast.
> 
> This statement made me smile more than it should have.  I am happy trump is miserably watching his legacy go down the shitter, we might have to flush 10-15 times though.

## Democrats' Choice: End the Filibuster or Watch McConnell Win (Again)

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-filibuster-schumer-mcconnell-harry-reid-barack-obama-1118110/):

> We talked about whether Democrats would finally get wise to McConnell's ways, how Biden could get things done in a divided Washington, what Democrats could have done differently during the Obama years, and whether Reid's successor - new Majority Leader Chuck Schumer - is up to the task. Mitch McConnell would like nothing more than for Democrats to fail to reform the filibuster because, first of all, it will allow him to block most of what Biden wants to do over the next two years. When you look back on the Obama years - particularly those first two, when voters had handed Democrats massive majorities - do you think Democrats would have gotten more done if they'd done away with the filibuster right way? Why do you think that didn't happen?There's no question that if there had been filibuster reform in the Senate, a lot more would have gotten accomplished: things like a public option for health care, perhaps some action on climate change, a bigger stimulus, the DREAM Act - there's a lot.

`/u/Albino_Black_Sheep` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l4o0kc/democrats_choice_end_the_filibuster_or_watch/):

> Mitch once fillibustered one of his own bills to obstruct Obama. If you truly want to make progress, take it away.

> It's stimulus money. It's mean to be spent! Then it goes back into the economy and is taxed. At the end of the day, American businesses will win and the government gets the taxes back. 
> 
> There wasn't hardly so much debating among her kind when they were cutting taxes for billionaires.
