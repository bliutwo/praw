## Friday Fun Thread

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/imjkvz/friday_fun_thread/):

> It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some homemade coffee, argue about the best stringed instrument, and talk about what's going on in your life. As always remember to follow our civility rules and save any meta feedback for our modmail. Please do not post anything directly related to politics in the Friday Fun Thread. We'd like these threads to be a refuge from the often-stressful political cycle.

## Biden: QAnon is ‘bizarre’ and ‘embarrassing,’ supporters should seek mental health treatment

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/04/biden-qanon-bizarre-embarrassing-409090):

> Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden denounced the QAnon conspiracy theory as "Dangerous" and "Embarrassing" Friday, suggesting those that support it should seek mental health treatment. Speaking at a campaign event in Wilmington, Del., Biden said the QAnon phenomenon was humiliating for the country and condemned President Donald Trump for failing to denounce it. Biden said Trump's failure to denounce QAnon was part of a playbook to sow discord in the country.

## Trump, Who Definitely Called John McCain A Loser, Is Denying Calling John McCain A Loser

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/trump-mocked-dead-soldiers-losers-john-mccain-atlantic-story):

> President Donald Trump is lashing out at a report he disparaged US soldiers who died in wars, suggested wounded veterans not participate in military parades because of their amputations, and angrily resented that flags were lowered to half-staff after the death of Sen. John McCain. "I never called John a loser," Trump wrote on Twitter, saying he had approved of the state funeral arrangements despite not being "a big fan" of McCain. Miles Taylor - the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration, who has since been speaking out against the president, describing him as "Dangerous" - also hit back publicly against Trump's denials about McCain.
