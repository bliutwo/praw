> Congratulations GOP.  As a lifelong republican voting in every election since 92 I have never voted straight ticket.  Always went by which candidate was best, but 16 was the first I ever voted for a Democratic president.
> 
> This morning, as a still registered republican, I voted straight blue in NY across the board.   Everything about the GOP disgusts me anymore.  Way to go.

## Whatever happens, remember this: Trump never once had majority support

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/03/whatever-happens-remember-this-trump-has-never-once-had-majority-support/):

> It is an important fact about the Trump era that President Trump has never once enjoyed majority support in this country. In 2016, the thing that totally undercut their chances was the fairly massive shift of White non-college voters toward Trump. Sargent: Obviously Trump as the unknown outsider who would throttle elites and shake down China to right previous trade wrongs was able to maximize White working-class vote share and turnout against Hillary Clinton.

## Trump's GOP Worked Harder to Stop People From Voting Than They Did to Stop Covid-19 From Spreading

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/11/03/trumps-gop-worked-harder-stop-people-voting-they-did-stop-covid-19-spreading?cd-origin=rss):

> "Building on his party's surgical, race-centered efforts to shut polling places and make voting a trial, Trump has called on his armed tough guys to show up outside the hostile voting venues that-despite best efforts-still remain." Building on his party's surgical, race-centered efforts to shut polling places and make voting a trial, Trump has called on his armed tough guys to show up outside the hostile voting venues that-despite best efforts-still remain. Clearly alluding to this gambit when he spoke November 1 on ABC News, Trump aide Jason Miller predicted Trump would win in part because of what he called "Media and Democratic suppression for their voters on election day"-ie.

## Hoarse Trump says his time in office has been â€˜meanâ€™ and lonely

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-fox-news-2020-election-biden-b1559189.html):

> A hoarse and exhausted-sounding Donald Trump rang Fox News on the morning of Election Day to weigh in on the "Season" and attack his opponent, describing him as being "Not prime time" and complaining that the job has been "Mean". Mr Trump replied: "In the old days you wouldn't put Sleepy Joe on every time he opens his mouth. You had Democrats on more than you had Republicans. I'm not complaining - I'm just telling people." Mr Trump continued: "If you look at the amount of horror that has gone on - Philadelphia, it's been a disaster. We are putting people on the honour system. But there is no reason to do this. I'd like to find out on the night of November 3.".

## Former GOP Governor of Pennsylvania Urges People to Vote for Joe Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/former-gop-gov-pennsylvania-urges-people-vote-joe-biden-1544353):

> The former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania has urged undecided voters to join him in voting for Democratic nominee Joe Biden to become president. Pennsylvania has emerged as the top battleground state in the 2020 election, with polls showing Biden ahead. Both campaigns view the state as the one that could tip them over the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House, with both Trump and Biden making a final push in the state in the closing days of their campaigns in a bid to secure the state's 20 electoral votes. "It's a vote for decency. A vote for the rule of law. And a vote for honest and earnest leadership. It's time to put country over party. It's time to dismiss Donald Trump."

> From a tweet from Fmr. Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Ridge:
> 
> > Alongside a link to the article, he wrote: "Should there still be a few of you undecideds out there - especially in Pennsylvania - I respectfully share my rationale why I'm supporting @JoeBiden. I hope you'll join me."
> 
> A reminder of what he said in September, as well:
> 
> > The 75-year-old noted that while there have been similarities to the nation's response to both crises, they "do not include presidential leadership."
> 
> > "Donald Trump has proven over these last four years he is incapable of such leadership," Ridge wrote. "It is not within him. He lacks the empathy, integrity, intellect, and maturity to lead. He sows division along political, racial, and religious lines.
> 
> Still holds true today...Vote Him Out!!! ðŸ˜¤
