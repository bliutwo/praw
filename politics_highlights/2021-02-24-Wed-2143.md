## Biden to Nominate 3 New USPS Board Members, Opening Path to Oust DeJoy

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-to-nominate-three-new-usps-board-members-opening-path-to-oust-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy):

> President Joe Biden will nominate three additional members to the U.S. Postal Service's board of governors, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. If Biden's nominees are confirmed by the Senate, this would give Democrats and Democratic appointees the majority of the board-which could then vote to remove embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Biden's nominees, according to the Post, will be Ron Stroman, a former deputy postmaster general; Amber McReynolds, the CEO of Vote at Home, an organization that promotes voting by mail; and Anton Hajjar, the former general counsel for the American Postal Workers Union.

## Lawyers have found the parents of 105 separated migrant children in past month

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/lawyers-have-found-parents-105-separated-migrant-children-past-month-n1258791):

> WASHINGTON - The lawyers working to reunite immigrant parents and children separated by the Trump administration reported Wednesday that they have found the parents of 105 children in the past month. One reason it has been so hard to find parents is that many agreed to be deported without their children to allow their children to remain in the U.S. to claim asylum, their lawyers say. A lawyer representing the separated families in the lawsuit, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, has said the task force should commit to bring the deported parents back to the U.S. under special protections to reunite with their children.

> Well look at that. You can reunite families if you actually try.

## Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick Blames Constituents for Giant Electric Bills: “Read the Fine Print”

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/dan-patrick-texas-electricity-bills):

> Obviously, that means that when demand increases, their bills rise, with the goal, according to architects of the system, being to "Balance the market by encouraging consumers to reduce their usage and power suppliers to create more electricity." But when the Texas power crisis hit, the state's Public Utilities Commission raised the cap on electricity prices to $9 per kilowatt-hour, leaving many people with completely insane bills to pay. In an interview with Fox News, Patrick told host Harris Faulkner, "I saw the story about the high bills. Let me explain that. We have in Texas, you can choose your energy plan and most people have a fixed rate. If they had a fixed rate per kilowatt-hour, their rates aren't going up. But the people who are getting those big bills are people who gambled on a very, very low rategoing forward, people need to read the fine print in those kinds of bills." Sure, Patrick added that the "Folks" who received $2,000 and $3,000 and $17,000 bills should "Not panic" and that the government is "Going to figure that out," but he also said that he's going to get to the bottom of why Texas's power grid failed in such a spectacular fashion when, again, the state was warned a decade ago that it needed to winterize its power plants.

## Democrat posts trans flag across from Marjorie Taylor Greene's House office

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/540375-marjorie-taylor-greenes-house-office-neighbor-posts-trans-flag-outside-door):

> Rep. said Wednesday she installed a trans pride flag outside her office after Rep., who works in a neighboring office, called an LGBTQ rights bill "An attack on God's creation." The Illinois Democrat included a video of herself adding the flag and a shot of Greene's office directly across the hall. Greene earlier this week called the Equality Act "a direct attack on God's creation" that would ensure "Men who dress and think they are women will have rights over all real girls and women." The GOP lawmaker has also co-sponsored legislation that would bar trans women and girls from women and girls' athletic divisions.

`/u/osaucyone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lrnrja/democrat_posts_trans_flag_across_from_marjorie/):

> Haven't checked, but I assume Republicans are clutching their pearls about how they're being discriminated against because they want to discriminate, correct?
