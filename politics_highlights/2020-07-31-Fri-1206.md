## Demands for Kushner to Resign Over 'Staggering' Level of 'Depravity' That Put Politics Before Public Health. "Holy hell. Jared Kushner reportedly abandoned a national testing plan because it was *politically advantageous* to sit back and let blue states be eviscerated by the virus."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/07/31/demands-kushner-resign-over-staggering-level-depravity-put-politics-public-health):

> In the wake of devastating new reporting by Vanity Fair, a chorus of voices Friday called for the immediate resignation of Jared Kushner, a top White House advisor and the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, for disastrous-and deadly-failures by the administration that appear to have put the political desires of the president above the public health needs of the American people. What the investigation uncovered, according to reporter Katherine Eban, was an ultimately "Aborted plan" for a far-reaching national testing strategy and a deliberative process that "Began not with public health experts but with bankers and billionaires." While the plan itself devised by the team Kushner put together was characterized as "Imperfect" but "a starting point," the most shocking revelations have to do with why the strategy, which members of the unit believed would head straight to Trump's desk and then be rolled out nationwide with large fanfare in early April, suddenly seemed to disappear-like "Poof into thin air," said one participant in the effort.

## Trump frequently accuses the far-left of inciting violence, yet right-wing extremists have killed 329 victims in the last 25 years, while antifa members haven't killed any, according to a new study

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/right-wing-extremists-kill-329-since-1994-antifa-killed-none-2020-7):

> When the review widened its category from antifa to "Left-wing violence," it found 21 victims had been killed since 2010, compared to 117 people killed in right-wing violence, in the same time period. Since the widespread protests began, Trump, senior officials, and Republican lawmakers have attempted to push the theory that antifa has been infiltrating protests to stoke violence. Trump's threatened to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.

> Go read any right leaning sub at any time of the day here on reddit. Somehow the "far-left" are simultaneously non working moms basement dwelling anarchist commie soy boys scared to come out in the sun while somehow maintaining an ironfist control over all the media in the world, running every commie corporation, ready to pounce and attack outside the front porch every red blooded fox news viewer, burning entire cities to the ground with no consequences, coordinating our government takeover with our Soros paychecks while drinking demon blood and eating semen sizzler steaks and trying to gjve poor people healthcare.

> 
> > “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” a public health expert who was in contact with the White House COVID-19 task force told Vanity Fair.

## Kushner's axed coronavirus team shied away from a national strategy, believing the virus was hitting Democratic states hardest and they could blame the governors, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-covid-19-plan-maybe-axed-for-political-reasons-report-2020-7):

> According to a new Vanity Fair report, the plan never came to be - partly because the task force believed that it would be a better political move to hold off. The logic, according to a source who spoke to Vanity Fair, was the the virus would hit Democrat-voting areas hardest, and the damage could be blamed on local governors instead. Throughout March and early April, Kushner led a task force, parallel to the White House's official efforts, to devise a coronavirus plan that would accelerate testing and supply chains nationwide. The virus has seen a major resurgence in both Red and Blue states since states began to ease their lockdowns.

## Trump’s ‘Delay the Election’ tweet checks all 8 rules for fascist propaganda

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/30/delay-election-trump-fascist/#click=https://t.co/c3qCEwwY4E):

> Just before 9 this morning, President Trump wrote this and pinned it to the top of his Twitter feed: "With Universal Mail-In Voting, 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???". A fascist guide to commentary on elections would have eight parts: contradict yourself to test the faith of your followers; tell a big lie to draw attention from basic realities; manufacture a crisis; designate enemies; make an appeal to pride and humiliation; express hostility to voting; cast doubt on democratic procedures; and aim for personal power. The president claims to defend voting but does so by expressing the desire to have elections indefinitely delayed.

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i1863e/trumps_delay_the_election_tweet_checks_all_8/):

> Trump is fascist. 
> 
> He’s going to push the limits of his power as much as he can get away with between now and November.
