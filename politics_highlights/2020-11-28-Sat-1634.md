> The January election will be administered under the same rules and by the same people as the November election. They're either both fair or both unfair.
> 
> * If the GOP says the January election will be fair and Republicans should vote, then they admit the November election was fair and Trump legitimately lost Georgia
> * If the GOP says the November election was unfair and Trump was cheated, then they are claiming the January election will be unfair and it's pointless for Georgian Republicans to vote.

## U.S. House to vote on ending federal ban on marijuana

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/marijuana/2020/11/us-house-to-vote-on-ending-federal-ban-on-marijuana.html):

> A postponed vote on landmark legislation ending the federal ban on cannabis will take place within a week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Friday. "By advancing the MORE Act, the House of Representatives sends an unmistakable signal that America is ready to close the book marijuana prohibition and end the senseless oppression and fear that this failed policy wreaks on otherwise law-abiding citizens," said Justin Strekal, political director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws."Americans are ready to responsibly legalize and regulate marijuana, and this vote shows some lawmakers are finally listening." A vote on the bill had been scheduled to take place before the election, but House Democratic leaders delayed it to avoid the optics of appearing to put a vote on cannabis ahead of passing a new coronavirus stimulus package.

> I haven't really looked to see if any studies have been done on the effects, but anecdotally living in a legal state ... things are not going to hell, it has not become a Mad Max-style lawless society, and it's nice to be able to go into a store like anything else and it says when it was picked, where, and how it was tested.

> The biggest crimes you heard about here was robberies, and that was because of the banking thing ... you had to have all cash on hand until some banks took a chance

## How Mitch McConnell's Do Nothing Republicans Are Killing You

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/11/27/how-mitch-mcconnells-do-nothing-republicans-are-killing-you):

> The Senate adjourned and left town without even trying to pass a COVID disaster relief bill. Remember: House Democrats passed a comprehensive relief bill all the way back in May. You, Mitch McConnell, have refused to lift a finger for months, and Senate Republicans have been happy to follow your lead. Countless Americans are now paying the price for your malicious inaction. First, there's no tradeoff between COVID and the economy, and no way to get the economy back until COVID is under control.

`/u/shizzybizmang` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2q2n7/how_mitch_mcconnells_do_nothing_republicans_are/):

> “No no you have it all wrong, all this bad stuff is because democrats keep passing laws in the House and then they somehow end up dead on arrival on this Senate desk next to me”

## Twitter Has Flagged 200 of Trump’s Posts as ‘Disputed’ or Misleading Since Election Day. Does It Make a Difference?

Summary of [original article](https://variety.com/2020/politics/news/twitter-trump-200-disputed-misleading-claims-election-1234841137/):

> In the 24 days since Election Day, Twitter has added warnings labels to 200 of President Trump's tweets or posts he has retweeted indicating that they contain false, disputed or misleading info. Overall since polls closed Nov. 3, about 30% of Trump's posts on Twitter have been flagged by Twitter as containing or potentially including misinformation, according to a Variety analysis. To be fair, Trump and his followers would be spreading fake claims about the 2020 election results even if Twitter didn't exist.

`/u/MeowFood` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2rd69/twitter_has_flagged_200_of_trumps_posts_as/):

> Can we stop for a minute and reflect on the fact that he has tweeted this many times, regardless of content, in the past 3 weeks? I don’t think I’ve tweeted 200 times in the past 10 years. He has the worst case of logorrhea I’ve ever seen.

## Trump ‘is considering an event to announce his 2024 campaign on the day of Biden’s inauguration’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-election-2024-biden-inauguration-b1763221.html):

> Donald Trump is considering launching his 2024 election campaign on the day of Joe Biden's inauguration, it has been reported - weighing up how to keep the spotlight on him in his post-White House life. On Saturday The Daily Beast cited three sources who confirmed he is considering a 2024 run, and two of them said that he had floated the idea of holding an event during Mr Biden's inauguration, to cause maximum disruption. On 9 November Axios was among the first to report that Mr Trump was considering a 2024 run - something which, if successful, would make him only the second man in history to serve two non-consecutive terms.
