## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 46

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jzlr1s/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate news about Trump, Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> New Hampshire finally got a mask mandate now that Sununu doesn't need to suckle on Trump's dirty golf toes!

## With nearly all votes counted, the 2020 presidential election wasn't that close

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/nearly-all-votes-counted-2020-presidential-election-wasn-t-close-n1248608):

> Joe Biden's popular-vote lead over Trump stands at 4 percentage points, 51 percent to 47 percent - and it's only going to grow once more of New York's votes get counted. The 2020 presidential race looked close the 12 hours after the first polling places closed on Election Night. Nearly three weeks later - with almost all the votes counted - it's now safe to say the Biden-vs.-Trump contest wasn't that close.

> It’s great that he beat Trump soundly but the reality is 73+ million people fucking voted for Trump. That is still a scary number of people who believe in that bozo.

## Trump is not just refusing to concede, he is sabotaging nation’s interest

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Trump-is-not-just-refusing-to-concede-15746472.php):

> President Trump is fast running out of schemes to overturn the election, as court after court has rejected his campaign's implausible claims. Trump's refusal to accommodate a smooth transition of power is not just a spasm of pettiness that once and for all should put to rest the question of whether the self-absorbed 45th president puts his vanity and quest for power above the nation's interest. Trump reportedly has been planning to tighten sanctions on Iran, which could complicate Biden's stated effort to re-engage the United States with the 2015 nuclear deal.

## Why Won’t Emily Murphy Just Do Her Job? In delaying the transition, the General Services Administration chief appears to be making an ideological choice.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-wont-emily-murphy-just-do-her-job/617184/):

> Slowly, members of the Trump administration got used to tolerating blatant, bold-faced lies. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of lies-important lies, stupid lies, insignificant lies, lies about attendance at the inauguration, lies about economic growth, lies about a hurricane forecast in Alabama. Some began to think defending the president's lies was patriotic, because he was the president.

> And thanks to Mitch, the Senate’s not even THERE to do its job like, I dunno, passing another COVID stimulus bill so that Americans stay afloat.

## Refusing to certify legitimate votes is a felony | Opinion

Summary of [original article](https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2020/11/23/michigan-canvassers-who-could-face-felony-charges/6388235002/):

> Republican Party officials have asked the Michigan Board of State Canvassers to delay certification on Monday. Michigan courts have repeatedly rejected wild claims of election fraud or improprieties as "Incorrect and not credible." The votes, at this point, speak for themselves. Watch live at 1 p.m.:Board of State Canvassers to vote on certifying Michigan election results.

`/u/sikeston` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jzi95i/refusing_to_certify_legitimate_votes_is_a_felony/):

> > It didn’t work. Under the then brand-new Voting Rights Act, a federal court noted that a “bare allegation” of irregularities cannot justify disregarding otherwise-valid votes in the canvass. The court ordered the election properly certified. Once all the votes were counted, Sheriff Clark lost … and never again held office.

`/u/kimya_d` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jzfuso/trump_team_falsely_claim_he_was_not_assisted_in/):

> Michael Lewis wrote a whole book — The Fifth Risk — about how the Obama administration and all the federal agencies spent months preparing transition materials and presentations (as Bush had done for them) only to have it all ignored by ignorant unqualified Trump appointees who think government does nothing so what’s to learn.
