Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/capitol-police-mask-mandate-arrest-b1893172.html):

> A growing group of Republican lawmakers are playing chicken with the Capitol police after refusing a new mask mandate despite the threat of arrest. Capitol police chief Thomas Manger ordered officers to report any members of Congress who refuse to wear a mask, warning they would be subject to arrest for unlawful entry under DC Code 22-3302. "Might as well come into my office and arrest my entire staff. We are not wearing masks. I support the Capitol Hill Police, but the Chief of Police made a mistake here. The physician and the chief of police don't have this authority."

> The Federal Election Commission has fined Sen. Rand Paul's 2016 presidential campaign committee $21,000 for how it handled certain financial contributions, according to documents The Courier Journal obtained. The complaint and the FEC's subsequent inquiry concerned a political action committee called Freedom for All Americans, which used to be known as Rand Paul for President, Inc. and was the Kentucky Republican's principal campaign committee during his presidential run in 2015 and 2016.The FEC found reason to believe Paul's campaign committee violated federal rules, according to the commission documents The Courier Journal obtained, which weren't available to the public yet as of Wednesday evening. The committees argued there's no evidence Paul took "Actions to explore a presidential run" before launching his bid and said RAND PAC didn't contribute to Paul's presidential campaign or "Alleged pre-candidacy efforts."

## 'I Am Frankly Angry And Ashamed.' Florida Doctors Blast DeSantis Over COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.wlrn.org/news/2021-07-22/i-am-frankly-angry-and-ashamed-florida-doctors-blast-desantis-over-covid-19):

> TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Ron DeSantis has drawn national attention for bucking federal health-care officials over the handling of the novel coronavirus, but a group of Florida physicians said Thursday the governor's push to reopen the state and block precautions are a main reason for a sharp increase in the number of residents suffering from COVID-19. "While hospitals in our state were filling up, DeSantis was shouting about 'Freedom over Faucism,'" said Ashby who leads the group of 405 Florida physicians. "As a physician and a Floridian, I am frankly angry and ashamed. You know the Florida-man moniker unfortunately holds true in this particular circumstance," Ashby said, referring to the stereotype that people in Florida do bizarre or stupid things.
