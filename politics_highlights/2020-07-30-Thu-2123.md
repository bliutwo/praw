## Topic Thursday: What role does the Vice President play?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0o587/topic_thursday_what_role_does_the_vice_president/):

> Constitutionally, the Vice President serves two major functions - to succeed the President in case of death or incapacitation, and as President of the Senate, enabling him to break tied votes. What role should the Vice President play in American politics? Should Presidents strive to give their VPs more power or relegate them to the bare minimum role that is prescribed in the Constitution? In light of the upcoming announcement by former Vice President Joe Biden of his running mate, who do you think he should choose? With respect to President Trump, would it be a good idea for him to choose a different running mate this time, or should he keep Vice President Pence on the ticket?

## What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/30/what-tremendous-burden-it-must-be-you-still-be-defending-donald-trump/#click=https://t.co/TTCNH1fh5d):

> What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending President Trump. Maybe Trump has you figured out and knows what a frightened political soul you are, and remembers that you remained mute when he defended Putin's killing of journalists and political rivals almost five years ago. You still refuse to criticize the Trump team's use of material stolen by Russia during the last month of the campaign, just like you and your president continue turning a blind eye to any Russian bounties.

> > What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending President Trump. You have called yourself a constitutional conservative for decades, but now you sit silently as the president pushes to move this year’s election because he might lose. Even some Republican senators are speaking up. Why aren’t you?
> 
> > Trump remembers how you ran interference for him when he claimed unlimited powers under Article II of the Constitution, so he thinks you will stay quiet. Remember your silence after Charlottesville? You eventually mustered the nerve to claim Trump never preached moral equivalence between torch-carrying Nazis and protesters. How unthoughtful it was of David Duke to expose you by praising the president’s putrid performance and thanking Trump for his “honesty and courage to tell the truth.” The former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard even bragged to reporters that Charlottesville represented a “turning point” for white nationalism. “We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump,” Duke proclaimed. “That’s why we voted for [him].”
> 
> > Ouch. That one had to sting, but you kept on defending Donald.
> 
> > If you had a political soul after that shameful stunt, the Cold Warrior in you would have been as sickened by Trump’s retreat from Germany as U.S. strategists were over his ceding of Syria to Vladimir Putin, handing Moscow a foothold in the Middle East for the first time since 1973. No country was a closer ally during the Cold War than West Germany, and no nation is more critical to Europe’s future now than a unified Germany. Undermining the U.S.-German alliance because of an ignorant misunderstanding of NATO’s dues structure undermines the historic work that Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush completed throughout the Cold War’s final years.
> 
> > But there you are, silently supporting a demagogue who sits by while intelligence suggests Russia’s leader put bounties on the heads of young American troops. Trump instead plays Putin’s apologist by declaring the United States equally guilty.

## Legal Experts Erupt After Mike Pompeo Says Bill Barr Will Determine Whether to Postpone the Election

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/legal-experts-erupt-after-mike-pompeo-says-bill-barr-will-determine-whether-to-postpone-the-election/):

> "You are one of the most highly trained and accomplished lawyers who are part of this administration," Kaine summarized, "Can a president delay a presidential election?". "'The electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President. "The president floating an election delay not only creates confusion; it's akin to misinforming the public and suppressing voters. That determination may already exist. If so, we need to see it, whether it embarrasses the president or not."

## Panic in the White House as Staffers Discover There Is Some Sort of Pandemic Happening

Summary of [original article](https://newrepublic.com/article/158684/white-house-staffers-coronavirus):

> Jake Sherman, the author of Politico's premier newsletter for Washington wankers, tweeted not long after the announcement of Cain's death that his team was receiving intel from "Deep inside the Trump administration" that aides "Feel like they cannot work safely during COVID, and are being told not to wear masks." A deleted tweet from Cain's account before the rally read: "Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!" Multiple Trump staff members also tested positive for the coronavirus after the rally. It's easy to see how there may be political pressure inside the White House not to wear masks, working for a president who only recently and begrudgingly wore one in public.

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0si43/panic_in_the_white_house_as_staffers_discover/):

> I guess it wasn’t a hoax after all. Just took over 154,000 people dying to figure it out.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-portland-national-guard-press-briefing-today-white-house-oregon-protests-a9647086.html):

> Donald Trump has threatened to send the National Guard into Portland if the governor and mayor fail to clear out what he says is a "Beehive of terrorists". Speaking at a White House press conference, the president said Portland was a disaster filled with professional agitators and anarchists. He said the National Guard would be sent if local officials didn't get the city under control in the next day or two.
