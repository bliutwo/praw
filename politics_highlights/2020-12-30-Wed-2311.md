> We have always had a link in our sidebar where users can apply to be a moderator, but the truth is we don't get many applications at all, so we have decided to reach out to users on a larger scale. Who are we looking for? We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/republican-conga-line-christmas-covid):

> Remember the recent viral video showing maskless people dancing their butts off in a Christmas Party conga line to the Bee Gees? "The media hysteria around this is shameful, it really is," said Thomas Paladino, the chief strategist of his mother's city council campaign, when BuzzFeed News reached out to the Whitestone Republican Party for comment about the COVID infection. The Whitestone Republican Party also posted a message on its Facebook page after the video went viral.

> > Paladino said he had not spoken to Trent, but that he was glad he was recovering and had no regrets about attending the party and did not believe it put anyone's health at risk.
> 
> > "It speaks very poorly of our society and our media and ourselves that an ordinary holiday party is now being made into something that we’re supposed to feel ashamed of," said Paladino, recalling that he once fell down stairs at a holiday party and broke his ankle.
> 
> > "Do I regret going to the party? Maybe," Paladino added. "Is it the party’s fault? No. Life happens."

> > **”So apparently the media is freaking out because we dared to celebrate the holidays in a perfectly ordinary and unremarkable way — with a gathering of friends and family,"** the group said in a statement. "A good time was had by all. We abided by all precautions. But we are not the mask police, nor are we the social distancing police."
> 
> Yes. That is EXACTLY the problem. This is not an “ordinary and unremarkable” time.

## McConnell slams Bernie Sanders defence bill delay as an attempt to ‘defund the Pentagon’. Progressive senator likely is forcing Senate to remain in session through 2 January

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/mcconnell-bernie-sanders-ndaa-defund-b1780602.html):

> The Vermont independent, who caucuses with Democrats, is forcing the Senate to weave through a maze of procedural hurdles before taking a final vote on undoing the president's National Defense Authorization veto. He is doing so because Mr McConnell is refusing to bring to a vote as a standalone bill a House-passed measure increasing from $600 to $2,000 Covid stimulus checks for some Americans. Instead, the majority leader made clear during his Wednesday session opening speech that he intends to keep the checks part of a three-part measure that also includes Mr Trump's demands for a repeal of legal protections for social media companies and a probe of his voting fraud claims.

> Isn't McConnell the one responsible by refusing to hold a vote on the $2000 stimulus checks?

## Jon Ossoff Tells Fox News Viewers 'Kelly Loeffler Has Been Campaigning With A Klansman'

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/jon-ossoff-tells-fox-news-viewers-kelly-loeffler-has-been-campaigning-klansman-1558148?piano_t=1):

> Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff on Monday said that the state's Republican incumbent, Senator Kelly Loeffler, has been "Campaigning with a Klansman," a reference to her December 11 photo with Chester Doles, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and member of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. Ossoff made his comment on a Wednesday Fox News interview after the interviewer asked him if he thought recent allegations of wrongdoing against fellow Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Reverend Raphael Warnock would possibly discourage state voters from choosing either Democratic candidate. "And here's the bottom line: Kelly Loeffler has been campaigning with a Klansmen. Loeffler has been campaigning, with a Klansmen, and so, I mean, we deserve better than that here in Georgia."

> To anyone saying that’s a dumb move because it will just lead racists to support her: ***Her opponent is a black man***.
