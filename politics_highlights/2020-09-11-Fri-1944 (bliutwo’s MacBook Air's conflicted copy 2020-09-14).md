> It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some homemade coffee, argue about the best Star Wars content, and talk about what's going on in your life. As always remember to follow our civility rules and save any meta feedback for our modmail. Please do not post anything directly related to politics in the Friday Fun Thread. We'd like these threads to be a refuge from the often-stressful political cycle.

## 'This is over the top': Lindsey Graham and Mick Mulvaney 'begged' Trump not to kill Iran's top general, but 4 days later he did it anyway, according to Woodward's new book

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-mick-mulvaney-begged-trump-not-kill-soleimani-woodward-2020-9):

He added that Trump had to consider his response and what Iran might do in retaliation, especially "With the election coming." The Trump administration has not made public evidence that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to US forces in the region, which was its primary justification for the strike.
