## Topic Thursday: What role does the Vice President play?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0o587/topic_thursday_what_role_does_the_vice_president/):

> Constitutionally, the Vice President serves two major functions - to succeed the President in case of death or incapacitation, and as President of the Senate, enabling him to break tied votes. What role should the Vice President play in American politics? Should Presidents strive to give their VPs more power or relegate them to the bare minimum role that is prescribed in the Constitution? In light of the upcoming announcement by former Vice President Joe Biden of his running mate, who do you think he should choose? With respect to President Trump, would it be a good idea for him to choose a different running mate this time, or should he keep Vice President Pence on the ticket?

## 3 Months Of Hell: U.S. Economy Drops 32.9%, In Worst GDP Report Ever

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/30/896714437/3-months-of-hell-u-s-economys-worst-quarter-ever):

> The report is expected to show that the economy shrank at an annual rate of about 35% during the quarter as shops and factories closed their doors in a desperate effort to slow the spread of the virus. That's about four times the drop during the worst quarter of the Great Recession. "Our associates are more scared to work today and guests are more afraid to go out, so sales have dropped," Mitchell said.

`/u/MumbleGumbleSong` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0l9yy/3_months_of_hell_us_economy_drops_329_in_worst/):

> >”Those government payments helped prevent an even steeper drop in consumer spending — the lifeblood of the U.S. economy — and allowed struggling families to buy groceries and pay rent.”
> 
> And the GOP solution is to drop that lifeline because “it doesn’t encourage people to look for work”. As if food and shelter are luxuries and people just aren’t pulling themselves up by their bootstraps enough in the middle of a pandemic. 
> 
> Sickening. Every last one of them.

## US suffers worst economic decline on record in second quarter as GDP contracts by 32.9%

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-economy-gdp-latest-coronavirus-trump-pandemic-a9645881.html):

> The United States has suffered its worst economic decline on record with the nation's gross domestic product contracting by 32.9 percent in the second quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to cause one of the largest financial crises in history. Last quarter's drop followed a 5 percent fall in the January-March quarter, during which the economy officially entered a recession triggered by the virus, ending an 11-year economic expansion, the longest on record in the United States. The contraction last quarter was driven by a deep pullback in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.

`/u/Juventus19` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0lcz8/us_suffers_worst_economic_decline_on_record_in/):

> > The contraction last quarter was driven by a deep pullback in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. Spending by consumers collapsed at a 34 percent annual rate as travel all but froze and shutdown orders forced many restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and other retail establishments to close.
> 
> This is where the "stocks are doing good" people lack actual vision of the state of the economy. The bulk portion of our GDP is in consumer spending. Just because Apple released a new phone or Google make some new widget or whatever doesn't point to the overall health of the economy. Our economy is driven by people going places and spending money there. 
> 
> Coronavirus hasn't gone away and people who are still in fortunate positions to still be earning their regular pay checks aren't spending their money. I know I'm not the only one, but just because bars and restaurants are open doesn't mean that I'm going to go to them. I'm not going to get on an airplane. I'm not going to stay at hotels. 
> 
> Any clown who doesn't see this is willfully blind.
