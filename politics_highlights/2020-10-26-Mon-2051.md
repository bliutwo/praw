## Trump Just Signed an Executive Order Letting Him Purge Thousands of Federal Workers for Disloyalty

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/donald-trump-civil-servants-schedule-f):

> "It's a two-pronged attack-a Hail Mary pass to enable them to do some burrowing in if they lose the election," Walter Shaub, who ran the U.S. Office of Government Ethics during Barack Obama's second term and in first six months of the Trump administration, told reporter Andrew Feinberg. "But if they win the election, then anything goes for the destruction of the civil service [This could] take us back to the spoils system and all the corruption that comes with it." Or as New Jersey chief innovation officer Beth Noveck put it, "It's the twin danger of both firing Fauci and replacing him with Eric Trump's wedding planner permanently." Or, say, a guy who thinks the government's strategy to combat the pandemic should be to let 2 million Americans get it and die.

## 'Classist and disgusting’: AOC rips Trump for mocking her college degree

> Pretty ballsy considering he paid someone to sit for his SATs and blocked the college from releasing his transcripts. That assures us his grades are utterly embarrassing. Never heard of a valedictorian blocking the release of their grades under threat of legal action- or anyone for that matter.

## She’s a Justice for now, but we can impeach Amy Coney Barrett — if the Democrats are brave

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/amy-coney-barrett-justice-scotus-impeach-democrats-b1351458.html):

> Democrats' failure to persuade the public and Republicans to suspend the nomination of now Justice Amy Coney Barrett has the potential to erode American democracy for generations. Longtime Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein has provided the best advice to the Democratic Party at this juncture: "If Amy Coney Barrett goes on the Court and immediately votes for PA voter suppression, she should quickly be impeached. Trump asked her openly to act to tilt the scales of the election." Even though Judge Barrett is now Justice Barrett, the fight is not over, and Democrats have an opportunity to redeem themselves in the immediate days ahead. It starts by being honest about their previous conduct.

`/u/notcaffeinefree` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jirg4y/shes_a_justice_for_now_but_we_can_impeach_amy/):

> People in the comments are missing the point of the article...
> 
> If Barrett votes in favor of voter suppression in Pennsylvania, the House needs to be impeach her, regardless of what the Senate will do. She should not be making decisions on things that will affect the very President who just appointed her and the House should make that obvious by conducting impeachment hearings into her conduct.
