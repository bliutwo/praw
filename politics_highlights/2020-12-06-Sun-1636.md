> *“First of all, it's President-elect Joe Biden, Secretary Azar,” Mr Wallace said. “Secondly, the fact is the president said on the first day, April 3rd, he wasn't going to wear a mask. He didn't wear a mask in public for three months, until July. And just last night at that rally in Georgia, not only didn't he wear a mask, but I was watching the rally — thousands of people packed together — none I could see wearing a mask. That is a direct violation of what the CDC and you are recommending,” the Fox News anchor said.* Yeah, saying he was 'checkered at best' was giving him too much credit. He was and is AGAINST masks wearing.

## Georgia voting manager says he now has 'police protection' to guard against threats caused by Trump's election disinformation

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-voting-manager-worries-about-threats-after-trumps-election-disinformation-2020-12):

> A Georgia voting manager said he has 'police protection' to guard against any potential threats that he may face as a result of President Donald Trump's misinformation about election fraud in the state. His rhetoric about the unfounded allegations has emboldened his supporters to harass individuals involved with voting this year in the state, according to Gabriel Sterling, voting system implementation manager under the Georgia secretary of state. In late November, Dominion Voting tore into one of Trump's lawsuits claiming "Massive election fraud" and called the allegations "Baseless," "Senseless," and "Physically impossible." The company is not a defendant, but it's mentioned in multiple instances throughout the 104-page Georgia lawsuit.

## Sun Sentinel Investigation: Gov. Ron DeSantis ‘Ordered Public Health Officials Not To Discuss The COVID-19 Virus With The Public’

Summary of [original article](https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/12/06/florida-governor-ron-desantis-ordered-public-health-officials-not-discuss-covid-with-public/):

> MIAMI - In the midst of this pandemic, a SunSentinel investigation found that Gov. Ron DeSantis and his administration had been misleading the public about the crisis from the beginning. A: So in the weeks leading up to the election, we essentially discovered that the DeSantis administration had ordered public health officials not to discuss the COVID-19 virus with the public. "Go get your flu shot. Watch out, it's radon season. Make sure that you get your yearly checkup, or that you're, you know, doing all of the other health things that you should be doing." But the Florida Department of Health, which is the main public health agency in the state, wasn't talking about the pandemic, it wasn't talking about COVID-19.
