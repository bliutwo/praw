## The $600 Unemployment Benefits Are Expiring This Weekend Because Senate Republicans Didnâ€™t Do Anything

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/congress-lets-600-unemployment-money-expire):

> One saving grace was that shortly after she lost her job at a local university, Congress passed the CARES Act, providing $600 per week in federal unemployment insurance aid on top of state benefits. Over 30 million people are drawing unemployment and will be left with state benefits only, which tend to be less than half of the federal amount. "We're days away from a crisis if these federal unemployment benefits aren't renewed," said Casey Wilkinson, executive director of Piedmont Rising.

`/u/earection` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hx8uz2/the_600_unemployment_benefits_are_expiring_this/):

## Dems Say Trump Administration Is Covering Up Intel on Ongoing Russian Election Interference

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/07/dems-say-trump-administration-is-covering-up-intel-on-ongoing-russian-election-interference/):

> Top Democrats are accusing the Trump administration of hiding from the public evidence that the Russian government is once again interfering in the US election in an effort to help Donald Trump. "Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November," the members wrote at the time. Shorty after the July 13 letter was released publicly, former Vice President Joe Biden vowed that as president he would "Impose substantial and lasting costs" on any foreign power that interferes with the election election.

## AOC Gave The Most Important Feminist Speech In A Generation

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/aoc-most-important-feminist-speech-generation_n_5f1afeb3c5b6128e68251cf9):

> Her speech was a clear signifier of the rising power of women in politics, which helped hasten her into office in 2018, along with a historic number of other female candidates. "Dehumanizing language is not new, and what we are seeing is that incidents like these are happening in a pattern, Ocasio-Cortez said."This is a pattern of an attitude towards women and dehumanization of others. Just for good measure, the congresswoman flipped a classic excuse for misogyny on its head: Men in politics have gotten away with their bad behavior toward women - or their misguided policies - by explaining that they actually know women, personally, and therefore are good guys.

`/u/Sumjhumms` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hxaqds/aoc_gave_the_most_important_feminist_speech_in_a/):

> It's disgusting when people say things like that to women and then hide behind their wives and daughters.
