## House Democrats Demand Increase in IRS Funding to Go After 'Wealthy Tax Cheats'—Like Donald Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/01/house-democrats-demand-increase-irs-funding-go-after-wealthy-tax-cheats-donald-trump):

> More than two dozen House Democrats are demanding that congressional leaders secure adequate funding for the Internal Revenue Service in an upcoming appropriations bill to ensure that "Wealthy tax cheats" like President Donald Trump are no longer able to skirt their obligations while the poor continue to face intense government scrutiny. "Millionaire tax dodgers like Donald Trump get away with paying little to no federal income tax in part because IRS funding has dropped over 20% since 2010," Chu tweeted Monday, referring to recent New York Times reporting showing that Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017. To bolster their demand for increased funding, the group of House Democrats pointed to the CBO's conclusion that "Increasing the examinations and collections budget by $20 billion over 10 years increases revenues by $61 billion, and if it is increased by $40 billion over 10 years it would increase revenues by $103 billion."

## The President* Is Running a Direct-Mail Scam from Inside the White House | Exiled Nigerian princes in my inbox have a less obvious pitch than this guy does.

Summary of [original article](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a34833700/trump-raise-150-million-after-election/):

> From the Washington Post:.President Trump's political operation has raised more than $150 million since Election Day, using a blizzard of misleading appeals about the election to shatter fundraising records set during the campaign, according to people with knowledge of the contributions...Much of the money raised since the election is likely to go into an account for the president to use on political activities after he leaves office, while some of the contributions will go toward what's left of the legal fight. 150 million, raised through one of the most obvious shell games in the history of American politics? According to the fine print in the latest fundraising appeals, 75 percent of each contribution to the joint fundraising committee would first go toward the Save America leadership PAC and the rest would be shared with the party committee, to help with the party's operating expenses.

## Trump shares posts asking ‘why bother voting for Republicans?’ ahead of key vote that could decide Senate

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-tweet-election-georgia-vote-b1764483.html):

> With almost a month until Georgia voters decide whether Republicans or Democrats control Congress's upper chamber, Donald Trump shared a tweet that asked "Why bother voting for Republicans?". "Why bother voting for Republicans if what you get is [Doug] Ducey and [Brian] Kemp?", said the tweet, which was written by conservative commentator Carmine Sabia, and shared by the president, a Republican. Republican donors and strategists told the Associated Press  they were concerned that Mr Trump's attacks on Republicans would persuade people not to vote in the Senate races, and that "Trump's comments are damaging the Republican brand", as Republican donor Dan Eberhart, described.

`/u/lilb1190` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k4kzrf/trump_shares_posts_asking_why_bother_voting_for/):

> Trump doesn't care about Republicans or political parties in general. He would have ran as a Democrat if he thought they would vote for him. He doesn't even believe in his own policies. He just took what the GOP promotes to its most extreme and rallied all of the stupid people around him.
> 
> Trump doesn't care about ending Obamacare beyond trying to hurt Obama legacy. Trump doesn't care about immigration or border walls. He doesn't care about the coal miners. He doesn't even care about keeping jobs in America. 
> 
> What trump cares about is trump. He takes care of his corporate buddies so that they will owe him a favor later on. He makes sure to promote his family members to positions that they are unqualified for but fires anyone in the administration that questions him. He throws "all the best people" under the bus because their failures reflect on him. He makes sure that the United States pays trump properties for him to go play golf and tries to get political figures to stay in his hotels.
> 
> Trump doesn't care about America. Trump cares about himself.

## 'All About the Grift': Trump Reportedly Raises Over $150 Million for Non-Existent 'Election Defense Fund'

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/01/all-about-grift-trump-reportedly-raises-over-150-million-non-existent-election):

> After bombarding supporters daily with emails blaring lies about the election and soliciting donations to overcome virtually non-existent voter fraud, President Donald Trump's political operation has reportedly raised more than $150 million since November 3, a staggering windfall that is being funneled into a Republican joint fundraising committee and a Trump PAC established to fuel his post-White House activities. "The fundraising requests are being made by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee that raises money for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. As of November 18, that committee also shares its funds with Save America, a new leadership PAC that Trump set up in early November and which he can use to fund his post-presidency activities." Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, told the Post that "Small donors who give to Trump thinking they are financing an 'Official Election Defense Fund' are in fact helping pay down the Trump campaign's debt or funding his post-presidential political operation."

> Wow. The man who, in 2016, said he's so rich he'd pay for his own campaign is still taking millions from his hapless supporters.
