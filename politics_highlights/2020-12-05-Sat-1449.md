## Jill Biden To Push For Debt-Free Community College As First Lady

`/u/OnlyLoveCanBreak` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k7b84u/jill_biden_to_push_for_debtfree_community_college/):

> Community college rules. I spent like $2000 total on my two years of general education 101 classes, then transferred and finished a bachelor’s degree at a four year school. In the business world as long as you have the degree, no one gives a shit where you did your first two years. 
> 
> I also got a scholarship for transferring in with good grades. I ended up with “only” around $25,000 in debt, which is still absurd college costs that much but I was able to pay everything off without too much pain.

> Funny, r/conservative isn’t going crazy over Trump asking for a list of republicans supporting Biden as the winner yet they went nuts over AOC saying we need to keep a list of Trump supporters in key government positions to remind us of who they really are when they delete their tweets.

## Trump Is Spreading the 'Dead People Voting in Georgia' Lie on Facebook: “Every day Facebook fails to correct the record and demote election disinformers in its algorithm, it rips the fate of this pivotal election out of voters’ hands."

`/u/RedditOfUnusualSize` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k79gy4/trump_is_spreading_the_dead_people_voting_in/):

> Ah yes, the ol' "dead people were voting!" chestnut.
> 
> For those of you who are under 60, and don't remember how this chestnut got started (or at least, how it became a meme that routinely burbles up in Republican politics), I first recall conservatives pissing and moaning about "dead people voting!" in the context of the Chicago vote machine swinging the 1960 election in favor of John F. Kennedy.
> 
> Nevermind that his opponent was Richard Nixon, that Richard Nixon was not particularly aligned with the conservative movement, that Richard Nixon did eventually become a two-term president, that Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in front of an impeachment charge, and that . . . dude, it was the damn 1980's, and that was more than two decades before my time. The Republicans had already won by that point.
> 
> In other words, "dead people voting!" the Republican political equivalent of "Eli Manning is a Hall of Fame quarterback!" sports-speak. Whether or not Eli Manning actually is a Hall of Fame quarterback is . . . debatable as a matter of fact, but it's not usually stated as a factual proposition. It's usually stated because the person speaking is Team Giants! all the way, and is signaling with his language that he's a fan of the Giants. Same thing here: whether or not dead people actually voted is irrelevant to the people who use the "dead people voting!" meme. They're not saying it because it is or is not true, and truth is quite irrelevant to the speakers. They're saying it to signal that they are Team Trump, but in this case, not necessarily Team Republican.
> 
> Hint: they'll almost certainly go back to being Team Republican. As Proverbs tells us, like a dog returns to his vomit, so to does a fool to his folly.
