## Lynda Carter cheers on 'Wonder Woman' fan Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 'Never stop being fierce and brave'

Summary of [original article](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/lynda-carter-praises-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-wonder-woman-181404354.html):

> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may have her share of detractors - as evidenced by her encounter with Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida last week - but she's got a firm fan in Wonder Woman. On her special day, Carter happened across a 2018 photo of Ocasio-Cortez - taken by photographer Daniel Arnold and posted by Vogue's Instagram account - which shows the New York congresswoman sitting next to a Wonder Woman poster in her Capitol Hill office. "Never stop being fierce and brave," the DC icon told the, erm, budding D.C. icon, adding that seeing Ocasio-Cortez's poster tribute "made my birthday that much sweeter.

## The Trump administration just admitted it lied about singling out New Yorkers for punishment

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-just-admitted-it-lied-about-singling-out-new-yorkers-for-punishment/2020/07/26/37f72888-cded-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html):

> The New York Times reported the government admitted in court papers filed Thursday that Homeland Security officials had made false statements about their February decision to cut off New Yorkers from the trusted traveler program, which allows prescreened Americans expedited passage through border checks when reentering the United States from abroad.The Trump administration had justified the cutoff by pointing to New York's new policy of refusing to disclose driver's license information to federal immigration authorities absent a court order. The administration claimed that the state's policy was unusual and that federal officials therefore could not trust the state to cooperate in the background checks needed to screen New Yorkers for the trusted traveler program. Mr. Trump declared the state must end "Unnecessary lawsuits and harassment" when he met with New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to sort out a compromise on the trusted traveler issue.
