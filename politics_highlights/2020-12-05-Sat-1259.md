## Jill Biden To Push For Debt-Free Community College As First Lady

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jill-biden-debt-free-community-college-first-lady_n_5fcbb575c5b6787f2a985511):

> Biden has also spent much of her career teaching at the community college level, and has been an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College since 2009. In a 2015 speech before the Community College National Legislative Summit, Biden traced her passion for education to her grandmother, who "Taught at an old-fashioned, one-room schoolhouse." Biden recalled how she kept her grandmother's school bell as a treasured heirloom and described the impact she felt from working with students to improve their reading skills. During her time as second lady, Biden also worked with former first lady Michelle Obama to launch Joining Forces, an initiative that urged Americans to "To rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities." As first lady, Biden plans to relaunch Joining Forces.

> Community college rules. I spent like $2000 total on my two years of general education 101 classes, then transferred and finished a bachelor’s degree at a four year school. In the business world as long as you have the degree, no one gives a shit where you did your first two years. 
> 
> I also got a scholarship for transferring in with good grades. I ended up with “only” around $25,000 in debt, which is still absurd college costs that much but I was able to pay everything off without too much pain.

## Historians sue Trump administration to stop ‘bonfire of records in the Rose Garden’ | Screenshots are not “complete copies” of presidential records, they say.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/12/05/trump-presidential-records-lawsuit-historians/):

> The Presidential Records Act requires presidents and White House personnel to preserve all records of "The activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of the president's constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties." The National Archives and Records Administration restricts these records from public view until at least five years after the end of an administration; some records can be withheld for much longer. The historians say White House counsel incorrectly directed staff to preserve such records "Via a screenshot or other means" in a February 2017 memo. Three of the groups - CREW, SHAFR and the archive - have previously sued to challenge the use by White House officials of encrypted apps such as Signal and to allege President Trump has violated the records act by not keeping records of phone calls and meetings with foreign leaders.

## Trump Is Spreading the 'Dead People Voting in Georgia' Lie on Facebook: “Every day Facebook fails to correct the record and demote election disinformers in its algorithm, it rips the fate of this pivotal election out of voters’ hands."

`/u/RedditOfUnusualSize` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k79gy4/trump_is_spreading_the_dead_people_voting_in/):

> Ah yes, the ol' "dead people were voting!" chestnut.
> 
> For those of you who are under 60, and don't remember how this chestnut got started (or at least, how it became a meme that routinely burbles up in Republican politics), I first recall conservatives pissing and moaning about "dead people voting!" in the context of the Chicago vote machine swinging the 1960 election in favor of John F. Kennedy.
> 
> Nevermind that his opponent was Richard Nixon, that Richard Nixon was not particularly aligned with the conservative movement, that Richard Nixon did eventually become a two-term president, that Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in front of an impeachment charge, and that . . . dude, it was the damn 1980's, and that was more than two decades before my time. The Republicans had already won by that point.
> 
> In other words, "dead people voting!" the Republican political equivalent of "Eli Manning is a Hall of Fame quarterback!" sports-speak. Whether or not Eli Manning actually is a Hall of Fame quarterback is . . . debatable as a matter of fact, but it's not usually stated as a factual proposition. It's usually stated because the person speaking is Team Giants! all the way, and is signaling with his language that he's a fan of the Giants. Same thing here: whether or not dead people actually voted is irrelevant to the people who use the "dead people voting!" meme. They're not saying it because it is or is not true, and truth is quite irrelevant to the speakers. They're saying it to signal that they are Team Trump, but in this case, not necessarily Team Republican.
> 
> Hint: they'll almost certainly go back to being Team Republican. As Proverbs tells us, like a dog returns to his vomit, so to does a fool to his folly.

## Trump—Consumed With 'Narcissistic Crusade' Over Election Loss—Slammed for Silence on Surging Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/04/trump-consumed-narcissistic-crusade-over-election-loss-slammed-silence-surging):

> While President Donald Trump has long been blasted for his well-documented tendency to lie to the public, he is facing fresh criticism this week for continuing to baselessly attack the November election results while also staying largely silent on the coronavirus pandemic, even as Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are surging across the country. The absence of widespread outrage over the president ignoring a pandemic that's now killed over a quarter-million Americans "Is another casualty of the Trump years," Corn added. "Nevertheless, at this particular point, it might not even do much good. Trump is immutable. He will not in the next six weeks turn away from his narcissistic crusade to overturn or discredit the election to focus on saving American lives. No amount of popular clamor will move him toward that basic task. But Trump has hinted that he might seek restoration in 2024. If he does, those Americans who wish to avoid a repeat of this deadly nightmare will surely need to highlight how outrageous that would be."

> One of my sister's best friends (a decent person who unfortunately drank the Fox News "Trump" brand draught of lies and hatred for too long) died last night from Covid. His hero and god-savior Trump couldn't give a single flying fuck about it. I hope his family does some serious reflection. 
> 
> Can you imagine being so brainwashed that you still revere someone who held a lot of culpability in getting your loved ones killed?
> 
> All the things they wailed about happening under the Democrats, came to pass under the Republicans and they can't even see it.
