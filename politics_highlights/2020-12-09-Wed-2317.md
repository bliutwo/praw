> > But the Texas case is Big Casino for these folks. They all believe that the Supreme Court will ride to their rescue and disenfranchise millions of people whom they don't believe should be allowed to vote anyway. The Republican Party is now a seditious, subversive organization, a Fifth Column of organized authoritarian yahoos. Where's Joe McCarthy when you need him?

## Biden must call out Putin’s secret war against the United States

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/biden-must-call-out-putins-secret-war-against-the-united-states/2020/12/09/41caf36e-3a51-11eb-9276-ae0ca72729be_story.html):

> While there are murky aspects and unanswered questions about each of them, taken together they look increasingly like a concerted effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to wage asymmetric warfare against the United States. In a broad sense, Mr. Putin may be seeking to score political goals, such as forcing Americans out of Afghanistan, disrupting the U.S. election or spoiling the U.S. rapprochement with Cuba. Or his attacks may serve tactical ends: weakening U.S. cyberdefenses; tormenting U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers serving abroad.President Trump, for reasons that have been mysterious, never confronted Mr. Putin about his dirty tricks.

## Poll: 60 percent do not want Trump to run again in 2024

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/529541-poll-60-percent-do-not-want-trump-to-run-again-in-2024):

> Sixty percent of voters don't want to run for president again in 2024, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHouse/Marist poll released Wednesday. A majority of Republicans said they would support Trump running in 2024, but the percentage, 67 percent, is significantly lower than the over 90 percent support he enjoyed among his party during the election. The poll comes the same day as a Politico/Morning Consult poll indicating 60 percent of Republicans think Trump is likely to run again, including 76 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 47 percent of Democrats.

> I think one of the main reasons that Trump will announce that he is running in 2024 is so he can keep the grift going on his glassy eyed, moronic cult. They are gullible enough to keep lining his pockets.

## Mitch McConnell trashed Democrats for holding up aid to jobless Americans — but the GOP stimulus plan contains zero dollars in extra federal unemployment benefits

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-trashed-democrats-delaying-unemployment-aid-gop-federal-unemployment-benefits-2020-12):

> The Republican economic rescue package he has touted contains no additional federal unemployment benefits and limited jobless aid overall. The proposal that McConnell introduced last week would include no extra money for federal unemployment benefits. It would renew a $300 federal unemployment benefit for 16 weeks from the end of December to April 2021, along with a federal program aiding jobless gig workers for the same amount of time.
