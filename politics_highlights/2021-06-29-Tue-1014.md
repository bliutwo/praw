## How close did Trump come to attempting a military coup? Much too close

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/06/29/how-close-did-trump-come-to-attempting-a-military-coup-much-too-close/):

> Contrary to what the professional smart people with their "View from nowhere" and too many other members of the chattering classes have claimed, the dangers of a coup perpetrated by the Trump regime were not exaggerated or hysterical, and most certainly were not symptoms of "Trump derangement syndrome." The danger was clear and obvious for those who were paying attention to reality as it is, and not as others wished it to be. He reportedly wanted the United States military to "Beat the fuck out" of the protesters and even "Shoot them." When told that such violence was illegal and inappropriate, Trump then suggested that the military could shoot protesters in the legs instead. It appears that Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper were able to stop Trump from ordering U.S. troops to act out his violent, psychopathic fantasies. The fundamental reason why Trump is targeting Milley and other national security leaders is because they stood up to him, and opposed his efforts to use the military as a personal weapon in service to his coup and his egomaniacal fantasies.

> The most important thing people need to realize is that just because Biden is in office does not mean that Trump's bullshit is over. He's got way too many people who have an almost fanatical devotion to him and his ideas.

## Opinion: The truth about many in the GOP base: They prefer authoritarianism to democracy

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/29/truth-about-gop-they-prefer-authoritarianism-democracy/):

> Although more than half of the strong authoritarian right-wingers "Disagreed that Trump should have refused to leave office, that paled in comparison to the approximately 9 in 10 liberal and low- respondents who said the same." The authoritarian-inclined are much more inclined to resist mask-wearing and get vaccinated. If a significant faction of the Republican Party adheres to Christian nationalism rather than the democratic civic religion, the rest of us cannot embrace them as good-faith partners in democracy. If millions of Americans maintain an authoritarian fixation, our democracy will founder, and what happened on Jan. 6 may become a post-election pattern.

> > We want to believe that goodwill can foster a return to less contentious and hyperpartisan times. But what if one side adopts noxious views antithetical to democracy — and, worse, rejects the basic premise of America?
> > 
> > We have witnessed Republicans’ reflexive defense of the disgraced former president’s illegal and corrupt conduct. We have observed that the majority of the party accepts the “big lie” of a stolen election and seeks to use that as a basis for suppressing the votes of minorities.
> > 
> > And we know that, once more, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has committed himself to one objective: the defeat and failure of a Democratic president.
> > 
> > In short, they have taken themselves outside the small-d democratic compact that requires, at the very least, that we respect election results and abide by normative guidelines in defeat or victory.
> > 
> > It would be somewhat reassuring to think this is a problem of Republican officials, donors and activists. Alas, the authoritarian temptation is luring millions of Americans away from the democratic experiment. “A scale measuring propensity toward right-wing authoritarian tendencies found right-leaning Americans scored higher than their counterparts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom,” a Morning Consult poll finds. “26% of the U.S. population qualified as highly right-wing authoritarian, Morning Consult research found, twice the share of the No. 2 countries, Canada and Australia.”
> > 
> > This means that a large percentage of Republicans — that is, tens of millions of Americans — embrace an authoritarianism defined “as the desire to submit to some authority, aggression that is directed against whomever the authority says should be targeted and a desire to have everybody follow the norms and social conventions that the authority says should be followed.” This inclination to follow a demagogue and to reject democratic values is more pronounced than in other Western democracies.
> > 
> > The most authoritarian-inclined Americans tend to be over age 45, live in rural areas and don’t have a college degree. This is the profile of the GOP base, not coincidentally. It follows that many authoritarian-minded Americans are willing to abide by the cult of former president Donald Trump and reject rational analysis. They burrow within right-wing media, refusing to confront facts and views that contradict their philosophy.
> > 
> > That authoritarian mind-set leads to a host of bizarre and dangerous articles of faith in the MAGA-infused GOP. Those with authoritarian beliefs are much more likely to conclude that the Jan. 6 insurrectionists were justified in the attempt to violently halt the electoral count; they are much more inclined to think Trump should not have left office. Although more than half of the strong authoritarian right-wingers “disagreed that Trump should have refused to leave office, that paled in comparison to the approximately 9 in 10 liberal and low-[authoritarian] respondents who said the same.” The authoritarian-inclined are much more inclined to resist mask-wearing and get vaccinated.

## Trump-Appointed Judge Lets GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert Block Twitter Critic Who Called Her a ‘Seditionist

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/politics/trump-appointed-judge-lets-gop-rep-lauren-boebert-block-twitter-critic-who-called-her-a-seditionist//):

> A federal judge in Colorado has ruled that Rep. Lauren Boebert can block critics on Twitter, reaching a dramatically different result from other First Amendment court battles involving prominent government officials in the age of social media. U.S. District Judge Daniel Domenico, a Trump appointee, found that the plaintiff, Bri Buentello, had not established that Boebert blocking her on Twitter amounted to "State action," a requirement in proving a First Amendment claim. In his ruling, Domenico found that Boebert had not engaged in "State action" because, as a Congresswoman, Boebert has "Almost no power to act on behalf of the United States government," and therefore was not a state actor who could limit Buentello's First Amendment rights.

> Shit, it's hardly defamation. We all listened to her rhetoric on 1/6. Fuck this seditionist.

## In Blow to GOP Narrative, Missouri Cut to Jobless Benefits Not Boosting Hiring | "It's almost as if the pandemic unemployment benefits weren't the issue."

> The thing is that we had leverage with the unemployment and the pandemic. Now would be the time to hold out on returning to work to force companies to pay us more. Republicans know this. They are jumping in front to prevent us from raising our salaries. It’s the once in a lifetime opportunity for us to reshape this economy into what we want and we have republicans trying to help the companies keep us indebted with low wages.

## Manchin says he's on board with Democratic-only infrastructure bill

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/560686-manchin-says-hes-on-board-with-democratic-only-infrastructure-bill):

> Manchin, during an interview with MSNBC, said that he had been assuming since "Day one" that Democrats would have to use reconciliation, a budget process that allows them to bypass a 60-vote legislative filibuster, to pass a larger infrastructure bill because Republicans don't want to make changes to the 2017 tax bill. "We're going to have to work it through reconciliation, which I've agreed that that can be done. I just haven't agreed on the amount, because I haven't seen everything that everyone is wanting to put in the bill," Manchin said on MSNBC. ADVERTISEMENT.Manchin added that the Senate can "Go through the process" on putting together a larger package that includes so-called human infrastructure knowing that Democrats will "Probably have to go to reconciliation and then do what we can afford to do." "Saying I'm going to not vote for the other one because you haven't guaranteed the vote for everything, we've never done legislation that way, I've never been a part of it in 10 years I've been in the Senate," Manchin said, adding that the bipartisan bill was "Doable" and that Democrats should "Take that victory."

`/u/The_Cox_Group` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oa944p/manchin_says_hes_on_board_with_democraticonly/):

> > Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said on Tuesday that he's supportive of going forward with a larger, Democratic-only infrastructure bill, but that it shouldn't be linked to a separate bipartisan framework. ...
> 
> > “We're going to have to work it through reconciliation, which I’ve agreed that that can be done. I just haven’t agreed on the amount, because I haven’t seen everything that everyone is wanting to put in the bill," Manchin said on MSNBC.
> 
> Manchin is saying he will not link this to the bipartisan bill - bipartisan bill goes first and then they can "work" on the reconciliation bill, with no commitments from Manchin as to what goes in it. And he would be "working" on this bill after progressives give up the leverage they have re: their votes on the bipartisan bill. This is about whether you trust Joe Manchin and his judgement as to what should go in the reconciliation bill, and I do not trust that. Hard no for me. Pass the reconciliation with the bipartsian bill or no bipartisan bill.
