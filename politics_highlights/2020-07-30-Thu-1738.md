## Topic Thursday: What role does the Vice President play?

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0o587/topic_thursday_what_role_does_the_vice_president/):

> Constitutionally, the Vice President serves two major functions - to succeed the President in case of death or incapacitation, and as President of the Senate, enabling him to break tied votes. What role should the Vice President play in American politics? Should Presidents strive to give their VPs more power or relegate them to the bare minimum role that is prescribed in the Constitution? In light of the upcoming announcement by former Vice President Joe Biden of his running mate, who do you think he should choose? With respect to President Trump, would it be a good idea for him to choose a different running mate this time, or should he keep Vice President Pence on the ticket?

"The president floating an election delay not only creates confusion; it's akin to misinforming the public and suppressing voters. That determination may already exist. If so, we need to see it, whether it embarrasses the president or not."
