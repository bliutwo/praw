## Fox News accuses Dr. Fauci of working for Biden — It's completely baseless.

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/laura-ingraham-anthony-fauci-joe-biden/):

> Primetime Fox News host Laura Ingraham has found a new conspiracy theory to float in the effort to discredit coronavirus expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. Ingraham claimed Tuesday night that Fauci is working on behalf of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. "Now, at this point, can we all just admit that Fauci is basically working for the Biden campaign?" Ingraham asked.

## Afghan Contractor Handed Out Russian Cash to Kill Americans, Officials Say

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/world/asia/afghan-russia-bounty-middleman.html):

> July 1, 2020, 7:16 p.m. ET.KABUL, Afghanistan - He was a lowly drug smuggler, neighbors and relatives say, then ventured into contracting, seeking a slice of the billions of dollars the U.S.-led coalition was funneling into construction projects in Afghanistan. Now Rahmatullah Azizi stands as a central piece of a puzzle rocking Washington, named in American intelligence reports and confirmed by Afghan officials as a key middleman who for years handed out money from a Russian military intelligence unit to reward Taliban-linked fighters for targeting American troops in Afghanistan, according to American and Afghan officials. Russia has walked a fine balance in recent years, eager to bloody the American nose, but wary of Afghanistan collapsing into a chaos that could spill over its borders.

## The White House Confirms That the President Can Read and Also Make Poopies By Himself

Summary of [original article](https://www.theroot.com/the-white-house-confirms-that-the-president-can-read-an-1844232076):

> McEnanyOfTheState literally held a last-minute press briefing just to defend President Trump against accusations that he doesn't give a fuck about American troops since he was briefed on Russia offering bounties to Taliban for American kills. Everyone inside the White House and out knows that Trump doesn't read the brief he's given every morning because he struggles with big words like "Betrayal" and "Turncoat" and "Apprentice thottie." Instead, he asked that he be orally briefed by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who heard the word "Oral" and got all excited until he learned that it just meant reading shit the president won't read."The President does read and he also consumes intelligence verbally," she said when questioned why Trump isn't reading his daily briefings. Now, the president did know as it was in the briefing he doesn't read and he's the most "Informed person on the planet." So which one is it? Did he know or nah? We know his ass knew and he didn't care.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theroot.com/trump-is-willing-to-defund-real-soldiers-to-protect-sta-1844232977):

> President Donald Trump, the man voted most likely to rub soft carrots all over his flaccid body, has weaponized Twitter once again by threatening to veto a national defense bill if an amendment from Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanding that military bases honoring the losers that are the Confederacy be renamed. "I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren Amendment, which will lead to the renaming of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!" Trump tweeted, NBC News notes. "American military bases that carry the names of Confederate generals are not named for heroes," Warren said in a floor speech Tuesday, NBC News notes.
