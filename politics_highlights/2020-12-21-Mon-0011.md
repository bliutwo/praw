## '$600 Is Not Enough,' Say Progressives as Congressional Leaders Reach Covid Relief Deal | "How are the millions of people facing evictions, remaining unemployed, standing in food bank and soup kitchen lines supposed to live off of $600? We didn't send help for eight months."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/20/600-not-enough-say-progressives-congressional-leaders-reach-covid-relief-deal):

> Democratic and Republican congressional leaders late Sunday reached an agreement on a roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief package that would send $600 direct payments to many Americans, boost unemployment benefits by $300 per week, and provide billions of dollars in funding for vaccine distribution, rental assistance, and other programs. "Eight million have fallen into poverty since June. If we hadn't made this deal today, 12 million Americans were going to lose unemployment benefits. But, again, this is not nearly enough for people." -Rep. Ro Khanna. "If we hadn't made this deal today, 12 million Americans were going to lose unemployment benefits. But, again, this is not nearly enough for people."

## White House secures ‘three martini lunch’ tax deduction in draft of coronavirus relief package

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/20/meal-tax-deduction/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social):

> The draft language of the emergency coronavirus relief package includes a tax break for corporate meal expenses pushed by the White House and strongly denounced by some congressional Democrats, according to a summary of the deal circulating among congressional officials and officials who are familiar with the provision. A proposal championed by the White House and Sen. Tim Scott would increase that deduction to 100 percent allowing companies to deduct the full cost of a business meal off their federal taxes. At the White House in April, Trump urged that the United States "Go back to the original" version of a tax deduction for entertainment and meals.

## Trump Tries to Ruin the Environment as Much as Possible Before Leaving

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-energy-firms-access-public-lands-drilling-1106326/):

> President Trump wants to ensure his pro-corporation, anti-environmentalist, climate change-denying legacy before President-elect Biden is inaugurated and is making moves to allow mining of natural resources on federally-protected lands, the New York Times' Eric Lipton reports. In his last days in office, Trump is moving forward on projects in numerous states that would grant energy firms access to lands that were previously off limits. In Twin Bridges, located in Utah, the Trump administration wants to open up wilderness land for a helium drilling project.

`/u/trenturrplants` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kh3h85/trump_tries_to_ruin_the_environment_as_much_as/):

> If an incumbent president is not given another term his waiting time between election and leaving office should significantly limit certain powers and abilities to ram through obviously vindictive policies through. Makes no sense.

## Surprise Medical Bills Cost Americans Millions. Congress Is Finally Set to Ban Most of Them.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/upshot/surprise-medical-bills-congress-ban.html):

> The bills most commonly come from health providers that patients are not able to select, such as emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and ambulances. Some private-equity firms have turned this kind of billing into a robust business model, buying emergency room doctor groups and moving the providers out of network so they could bill larger fees. Among the major consumer problems in the fiendishly complex health system, surprise billing was the rare Washington issue that both parties could get behind.
