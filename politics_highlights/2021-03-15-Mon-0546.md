## Bernie Sanders Asks Jeff Bezos 'What Is Your Problem' With Amazon Workers Organizing

> Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders challenged Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to explain reports of the retailing giant's alleged aggressive anti-union tactics being used to prevent workers from organizing at U.S. facilities. During his appearance on MSNBC Sunday, Sanders poked at Bezos and said he, of all people, "Can afford to pay them more." The senator then asked why the billionaire would even choose to oppose workers who are organizing to guarantee permanent, and not temporary, improvements in safety and job security. "I say to Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet: What is your problem with Amazon workers organizing for better working conditions and better pay? You are worth $182 BILLION. You cannot continue to have it all when so many are struggling," Sanders told MSNBC host Ali Velshi in response to Bezos declining his Senate invitation.

## Fauci Baffled That 47 Percent of Trump Voters Refuse Vaccine: 'I Just Don't Get It'

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/fauci-trump-vaccine-1141326/):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed surprise at recent polling that shows many Republicans and Trump voters have no plans on getting vaccinated, and he's hoping the former president will do more to urge his followers to do so. Asked if Trump, who was vaccinated in secret while still in the White House, should do more in promoting the vaccines, Fauci said, "I hope he does because the numbers that you gave are so disturbing." Fauci touted the former president's vaccine initiative Operation Warp speed and popularity among his followers while saying an aggressive promotion by Trump would be a "Game-changer."

`/u/wtfwasdat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/m529zl/fauci_baffled_that_47_percent_of_trump_voters/):

> Here's the thing.   Republicans think voluntarily inconveniencing yourself in a way that helps other people is losing.  If all the vaccine did was protect them individually while everyone else suffered they would be shoving everyone out of the way to get it.  But because there is a narrative that society as a whole will benefit if everyone gets the vaccine, they would rather roll the dice and catch corona.
