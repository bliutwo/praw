What questions do you have about what might happen with this legislation, the voting rights landscape in Texas and the political context of these efforts to limit voting options? Ask me anything on July 7 from 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. ET. Proof: https://i.

## Mitch McConnell Says Bipartisanship Is “Over.” Believe Him.

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/mitch-mcconnell-says-bipartisanship-is-over-believe-him/):

> If you doubt this, look no further than Kentucky, home state of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. "For McConnell, politics is sport. He's won and lost and is now aiming to recapture his old title of Senate majority leader in the 2022 midterm elections. 'If you're a football fan, it's like the difference between being the offensive coordinator and a defensive coordinator,' McConnell told me. 'The offensive coordinator has a better chance to score.'". Mitch McConnell said so into a live microphone, and on such matters, I take him entirely at his word.

## In Leaked Video, GOP Congressman Admits His Party Wants 'Chaos and Inability to Get Stuff Done'

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/07/leaked-video-gop-congressman-admits-his-party-wants-chaos-and-inability-get-stuff):

> Newly leaked video footage of a recent event hosted by the right-wing group Patriot Voices shows Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas openly admitting that his party wants "18 more months of chaos and the inability to get stuff done" as President Joe Biden, a bipartisan group of senators, and congressional Democrats work to pass climate and infrastructure legislation. In the video that emerged Tuesday, the Texas Republican dismisses the Democratic reconciliation package-which progressives hope will include at least $6 trillion in spending on climate programs, Medicare expansion, and other priorities left out of the bipartisan plan-as "Liberal garbage." Roy's articulation of the Republican Party's strategic thinking is hardly a diversion from what the GOP leadership has said publicly, but it was viewed as further evidence that the bulk of the minority party is not interested in good-faith legislative talks with the Democratic majority.

> As one of his former constituents, I'm obligated to say, fuck Chip Roy.

## Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Biden's vaccine push to Nazis weeks after apologizing for comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-biden-vaccine-push-nazis-apology-holocaust-comparisons-2021-7):

> Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Tuesday compared President Joe Biden's push to vaccinate Americans to the Nazi regime, weeks after apologizing for comparing other COVID-19 restrictions to the Nazis. The American Jewish Congress released a statement Wednesday addressing Greene's tweet, saying that the congresswoman "Continues to prove that there is no limit to her brutal trivialization of the Holocaust for her own personal political power." "The Holocaust is - there's nothing comparable to it. It's, it happened, and, you know, over six million Jewish people were murdered."

## GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger Says 'Vast Majority of Colleagues' Believe Trump Incited Capitol Riot

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/gop-rep-adam-kinzinger-says-vast-majority-colleagues-believe-trump-incited-capitol-riot-1607661):

> Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger says the "Vast majority of [his] colleagues" believe that former President Donald Trump incited the January 6 Capitol riot, but that they have remained silent out of fear of retribution. Kinzinger was one of only 10 House Republicans who broke with the party to vote with Democrats in favor of impeaching Trump for a second time for his role in the deadly Capitol attack. "What's even more sad, Anderson, is not that so many people aren't acknowledging the truth, it's that there are millions of people, base voters, Republican voters, many in my district, that believe the big lie and it's not really their fault-although, everyone is responsible for what you believe and doing research-but all the leaders they trust are sitting here telling them it's the big lie," the Illinois Republican said.

> Im so sick of this. Either they are far too cowardly to represent us in congress or they are complicit and helped and should go to jail. I’m just going to assume that republicans are acting in bad faith because they’ve never shown me otherwise
