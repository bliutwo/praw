## We're from the Fair Elections Center, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Campus Vote Project, here to discuss the critical need for Americans to serve as poll workers this year. Ask us anything about how to get involved and the impact your service can have on supporting our democracy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzhw6c/were_from_the_fair_elections_center_the_us/):

> Fair Elections Center developed WorkElections.com, a website that compiles poll worker requirements and application links for thousands of jurisdictions in states across the country. The current pandemic has dramatically reduced the traditional pool of poll workers - many of whom are older - and created an urgent need for recruiting a new workforce to ensure adequate staffing at the polls this fall. A shortage of poll workers could mean closure of polling places and longer lines to vote.

> Is there any contingency plan if federal agents/DHS troops are physically barring citizens from voting?

> If Trump "ordered" them to leave, I assume they were actually being kicked out, so he's declaring victory in the face of retreat.

## Trump Re-Tweets Judge Napolitano Op-Ed Calling Deployment of Feds in Portland ‘Unconstitutional’ and ‘Totalitarianism’

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-re-tweets-judge-napolitano-op-ed-calling-deployment-of-feds-in-portland-unconstitutional-and-totalitarianism/):

> Stashed between four re-tweets which originated from Fox Business News's Jim Varney and one from a conservative blogger defending Trump's pandemic response, Trump also retweeted a Washington Times op-ed which virulently denounced the president's deployment of federal agents in Portland as "Unconstitutional." The former New Jersey Superior Court judge then called out DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf and President Trump for defending "These thugs" under the guise of "Law and order," saying their conduct in Portland was "Unlawful, unconstitutional and harmful." Napolitano continued to disparage the federal government's intervention in Portland on Tuesday when he appeared on Your World with Neil Cavuto.

## OK, But Really: What If Obama Brushed Off Russian Bounties on American Soldiers? | Donald Trump has been supremely confident in his ability to bury this story

Summary of [original article](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a33457444/trump-russian-bounties-american-soldiers-afghanistan/):

> He's been so confident in his ability to bury the story in other outrages that he even feels confident enough in the story's having cooled that he can mention that he had a nice chat with Vladimir Putin the other day, and it was so pleasant that the subject never came up. One of the elements of his 2016 campaign that made some marks on the American left at least Trump-curious was his apparent promise to extricate the country from its adventurism in West Asia. Prying the U.S. out of the Afghanistan sinkhole requires a deft hand with both carrots and sticks and, as demonstrated by the fact that the deal he trumpeted in February to remove American troops has broken down utterly because the warring elements within Afghanistan can't keep their hands off each other for 20 minutes at a time.

## Louis Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask, tests positive for coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/29/louis-gohmert-who-refused-to-wear-a-mask-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-386076):

> Rep. Louie Gohmert - a Texas Republican who has been walking around the Capitol without a mask - has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to multiple sources. The eighth-term Republican told CNN last month that he was not wearing a mask because he was being tested regularly for the coronavirus. At one point in the hearing, Chairman Jerry Nadler chastised several Republicans for taking off their masks, though Gohmert was not among those he scolded.

`/u/StevenSanders90210` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i01dej/louis_gohmert_who_refused_to_wear_a_mask_tests/):

> 7 of 8 representatives testing positive are Republican. Probably just a coincidence.

## 'Put your mask on!': Lawmakers erupt after Jim Jordan throws a temper tantrum during the big tech hearing

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/antitrust-hearing-lawmakers-erupt-jim-jordan-temper-tantrum-put-your-mask-on-2020-7):

> Lawmakers slammed US Rep. Jim Jordan at Wednesday's antitrust hearing as he asked Google about allegations of anti-conservative bias and interrupted a colleague. After Jordan's time ended, the next lawmaker in line to ask questions, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, took a jab at Jordan and told tech executives she would "Redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories." As Jordan interrupted Scanlon, Committee Chairman David Cicilline and other lawmakers in the room lashed out at the Ohio congressman.

`/u/JesseTheSoulVentura` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i0770u/put_your_mask_on_lawmakers_erupt_after_jim_jordan/):

> Odd he would struggle with the mask as Jim Jordan excelled at cover ups when coaching at Ohio State.
