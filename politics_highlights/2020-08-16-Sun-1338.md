Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-election-result-take-years-as-usps-attack-fears-grow-2020-8):

> President Donald Trump, in remarks to reporters, said that knowing the result of this year's presidential election could take "Months" or "Years," as he continued to cast doubt on mail-in votes ahead of an expected surge in the number of Americans casting their ballot by post. "Usually at the end of the evening, they say 'Donald Trump has won the election, Donald Trump is your new president,'" Trump said during the remarks at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. At the briefing, Trump also defended Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump donor appointed to the role in May, who has introduced a series of controversial reforms critics say have reduced the service's capacity to process and deliver mail in a timely way.

Lee and Courtney Kube.WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has told aides he'd like to hold an in-person meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the November election, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Trump excluded his top aides from the meeting and said afterward that he believed Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Trump has expressed interest in holding another meeting with Putin for some time, the people familiar with the discussions said.

`/u/dvd_man` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/iardpf/trump_eyes_putin_meeting_before_november_election/):

> Obviously. They need to discuss Putin’s efforts to re-elect Trump, as well as repayment for the favour. I bet there won’t be any need for a translator in the room this time.
