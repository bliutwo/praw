## Mike Pence’s narrow escape thanks to Capitol officer Eugene Goodman revealed in new video

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-eugene-goodman-capitol-video-impeachment-trial-b1800649.html):

> House impeachment managers showed previously unreleased security footage from inside the US Capitol during the 6 January insurrection, including footage of former Vice President Mike Pence and his family evacuating the US Senate chamber from an adjoining office, as another video shows Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman leading a mob away from the chamber doors. Officer Goodman - who was also on duty at the Capitol on Wednesday - steered a mob away from Senate chambers shortly after insurrectionists in tactical gear, including at least one person carrying a baseball bat, while others carried flagpoles, broke through windows on the Senate side of the Capitol. Previously shown footage of Officer Goodman shows the Black officer holding back dozens of mostly white rioters up a flight of stairs as he appeared to steer them away from the Senate chambers, where lawmakers and staff took shelter.

## Trump used the word 'peacefully' once during pre-Capitol riot speech. He said 'fight' 20 times, impeachment manager notes.

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/966165/trump-used-word-peacefully-once-during-precapitol-riot-speech-said-fight-20-times-impeachment-manager-notes):

> Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of the House impeachment managers, on Wednesday took on the job of deconstructing the speech former President Donald Trump gave at a Jan. 6 rally before the crowd of his supporters marched to the Capitol and violently breached the building. Dean's statement alone likely won't convince Republicans who are prepared to acquit Trump, but she did highlight the fact that throughout the nearly 11,000-word speech - "Yes, we did check," she said - there was only one single point that Trump used the word "Peacefully" or suggested non-violent action. "In a speech spanning almost 11,000 words - yes, we did check - that was the one time, the only time President Trump used the word 'peaceful' or any suggestion of nonviolence" pic.

## Republican senators doodled, put their feet up, and read while Democratic impeachment managers made their case against Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/rand-paul-doodled-maskless-during-democrats-impeachment-arguments-2021-2):

> Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, doodled and drew a picture of what appeared to be the Capitol, according to reporters in the room. Paul wasn't present in the chamber during much of a later portion of the arguments. Pecorin said Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who voted with Democrats on Tuesday to proceed with the impeachment trial, was the most voracious notetaker in the chamber.

>  I wish they could be treated like a normal jury in this case and get removed from the case for crap like that.

## It Sure Looks Like Trump Will Face Criminal Charges for Election Fraud

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/trump-raffensperger-election-fraud-criminal-charges.html?via=rss):

> Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has opened a criminal investigation into Donald Trump's attempt to interfere with Georgia's election, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Willis noted in the retention request that the investigation includes potential violations of Georgia laws "Prohibiting the solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and any involvement in violence or threats related to the election's administration." This lengthy list of possible offenses indicates that the district attorney is focusing on the most obvious charge, solicitation of election fraud, but also looking at a broad range of criminal laws in building her case against Trump. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, also has the power to charge Trump for his interference in the election.

> Yowza.

> >“Under Georgia law, it is illegal to falsify any records used in connection with an election, or to place any false entries in such records. And any person who “solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or otherwise attempts to cause the other person” to falsify voting records is guilty of “criminal solicitation to commit election fraud in the first degree.” ***The crime is a felony offense, punishable by up to three years in prison (and no fewer than one year). An individual is culpable even if they failed to induce fraud.***”
