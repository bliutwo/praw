## Trump teased a forthcoming health care plan more than a dozen times as president. Then nothing happened.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/04/trump-teased-forthcoming-health-care-plan-more-than-dozen-times-president-then-nothing-happened/):

> One week before the election in 2016, Trump told rallygoers he would ask Congress to convene a special session to repeal the Affordable Care Act.By March 2017, Trump said he never planned to repeal and replace the law in 64 days, omitting that he repeatedly promised to repeal and replace it on his first day in office. Nearly two months later, Trump said the yet-to-be-revealed plan would be implemented if Republicans retake the House in 2020.It is still not clear what such a plan would entail or how it would become law, given that Democrat have previously opposed Trump's health-care actions and control the House of Representatives. "We're signing a health-care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health-care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do," Trump said.

## Trump refers to deadly Beirut explosions as 'terrible attack' - despite no evidence incident was deliberate

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-beirut-explosion-video-press-conference-today-lebanon-a9654361.html):

> Donald Trump has described deadly explosions in Lebanon as a "Terrible attack" before officials have determined the cause of the blasts and with no immediate evidence to suggest they were intentional. Massive explosions in Beirut on Tuesday have killed at least 70 people and injured more than 3,000 others while levelling a large segment of the capital. During the president's briefing, Joe Biden - his Democratic rival - said that "Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut".

> He was asked to clarify in a press conference and doubled down that it seemed to be an attack/bomb. I’m not surprised that Trump wouldn’t be able to comprehend a large explosion in any other way.

## Oregon Senator Ron Wyden says Trump deployed 'secret police' in Portland to provoke violence for campaign ads

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/portland-senator-says-trump-deployed-secret-police-for-campaign-ads-2020-8):

> President Donald Trump sent his "Secret police" to Portland in order to spur the sort of violence that he is both campaigning on and against, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said Tuesday. Wyden, the son of two refugees from Nazi Germany, attacked Trump for having "Heavily armed secret police snatching Portlanders off the streets," saying the president did so "To create images of chaos for his own political gain - to air in campaign ads." Last month, Wyden told Business Insider that "What is happening in my hometown won't stop at my hometown." Soon after, President Trump announced he was sending more federal agents to cities such as Albuquerque, New Mexico, where last week hundreds of people protested the deployment.

> Then that needs to be in ads, explaining that Trump risked murdering and torturing Americans for television ads.

## Trump on John Lewis: He Didn’t Come to My Inauguration, So I Didn’t Go to His Funeral, and I’ve Done More for Blacks Than He Did

Summary of [original article](https://www.theroot.com/trump-on-john-lewis-he-didn-t-come-to-my-inauguration-1844605471):

> Trump literally fixed his anus-shaped mouth to refuse to give civil rights god John Lewis his flowers and basically stated that he didn't want to celebrate the Georgia Democrat because he refused to attend his 2017 inauguration. Trump was asked how he thought history would remember Lewis and Trump's answer was, yep, you guessed it, petty AF."I can't say one way or the other," Trump said when asked if he thought Lewis was impressive. Trump couldn't even say that Lewis' story was impressive; the most he could muster was a half-hearted shoutout to Lewis and all those who've also fought for civil rights.

> >I’ve Done More for Blacks Than He Did

> He's delusional and self-aggrandizing enough that he might actually believe that.

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/04/the-daily-caller-has-been-paid-by-gop-campaigns-while-providing-fact-checking-services-for-facebook/):

> The Daily Caller has taken tens of thousands of dollars to help Republican campaigns raise money while performing political fact-check services for Facebook. The Republican National Committee disclosed spending about $4,500 to rent an email list from The Daily Caller in March 2016 just before Trump secured the nomination, according to FEC records. The Trump campaign also previously paid $150,000 the Daily Caller to rent its list, though it did not disclose the payment, which was shelled through a third-party vendor.

> The ratfucking goes on and Facebook will do nothing about it.  It's like someone has promised them little to no regulation if they put their thumb on the scale for the GOP.
