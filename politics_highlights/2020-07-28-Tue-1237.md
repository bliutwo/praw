> Serves him right. I had a contact on social media share that video and I watched most of it and was very alarmed. Literally just an entire circle jerk of doctors spouting trumps 3 month old talking points that have been scientifically disproven. Sad part is this person actually believed the video and when I called him out, he asked me if I though it was a red flag that the video got taken down so fast. I said, no..it just means that its misinformation to me...
