## City of Albuquerque sends $211K bill for Trump campaign to Mar-a-Lago

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/albuquerque-trump-campaign-collections-ce472af2-e197-4651-9406-be58f59f6cb4.html):

> City officials in Albuquerque are trying to recoup costs for an unpaid Trump campaign bill totaling more than $211,000 incurred during a 2019 Rio Rancho rally, referring the six-figure tab to a debt collections agency. 94 to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort after originally sending it to New York-based Donald J. Trump for President Inc., the Albuquerque Journal reported. The city sent the invoice after the rally to cover costs associated with Trump's security at a downtown Albuquerque hotel.

## With $100B internet plan, Biden commits to bring down ‘overpriced’ broadband bills

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/biden-internet-broadband-bills-478734):

> As is, the infrastructure proposal includes provisions that would require broadband providers to clearly disclose their monthly internet pricing, in line with provisions that top congressional Democrats including House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and Sen. Amy Klobuchar sought in similar legislation. December's bipartisan pandemic relief law slated $3.2 billion to create an Emergency Broadband Benefit subsidy fund at the FCC, which will likely launch next month and help struggling consumers with $50 a month for their internet bills. Other fights likely incoming: Although the Biden fact sheet doesn't say how he'll tackle high monthly costs of internet service, his connectivity agenda includes provisions Republicans are likely to oppose, such as explicit support for having local governments run their own broadband networks.

`/u/scottieducati` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mx1fgb/with_100b_internet_plan_biden_commits_to_bring/):

> Make it a public utility with a framework for city and states to cooperatively manage it like the rest of our infrastructure.

## Rep. Debbie Dingell done with universal health care "baby steps," calls for single-payer system

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/rep-debbie-dingell-done-universal-health-care-baby-steps-calls-single-payer-system-1586067):

> Noting how many Americans' health insurance is tied to their jobs, Dingell explained how access to health care became precarious as millions lost their jobs during the pandemic. Dingell said the nation's health care system already has the funds to execute this. "The United States health care system is the most expensive health care system in the world right now, and we have far worse outcomes than other countries, one of the highest mortality rates in the world," she said.
