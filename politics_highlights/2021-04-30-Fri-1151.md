## Merrick Garland rapidly erasing Trump effect at Justice Department

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/merrick-garland-justice-department-giuliani-15af1522-83fd-43e3-9d9d-1331873c9058.html):

> Attorney General Merrick Garland is quickly negating the Trump administration's law enforcement legacy, dismaying conservatives with a burst of aggressive reversals and new policies. Attorney General Bill Barr played a central role in the Trump administration's most high-profile controversies, from undermining the Russia investigation to intervening in the cases of indicted Trump associates to ordering the forcible clearing of protesters in Lafayette Square Park.DOJ's broad authority also overlaps with many of the issues at the top of President Biden's agenda, including restoring faith in government, promoting racial justice and police reform, and curbing gun violence. Driving the news: Liberal fears that the soft-spoken Garland might resist prosecuting Trump and his allies for the sake of unity were partially eased on Wednesday, when news broke that federal agents had raided the Manhattan home of Rudy Giuliani.

After Merrick B. Garland was confirmed as President Biden’s attorney general, the Justice Department lifted its objection to the search.

## Matt Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg claims in letter that Gaetz paid for sex with minor

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/04/30/matt-gaetz-associate-joel-greenberg-claims-in-letter-that-gaetz-paid-for-sex-with-minor/):

> Embattled pro-Trump firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., paid to have sex with a 17-year-old minor, according to a letter reportedly written by Joel Greenberg, one of Gaetz's longtime friends, that was published by The Daily Beast late on Thursday night. Greenberg, a longtime associate of Gaetz and the former tax collector in Seminole County, Florida, has been the focus of various investigations and has been indicted on 33 felony counts, which include charges stemming from the alleged sex trafficking of minors. The Beast reports that Greenberg offered Stone $250,000 in Bitcoin, but Stone cautioned, "I cannot push too hard because of the nonsense surrounding pardons." A week before Trump left office, Stone allegedly contacted Greenberg through the encrypted messaging app Signal to tell the Gaetz associate he was "Feeling confident" and that Greenberg should therefore prepare the Bitcoin payment.

## Matt Gaetz’s Wingman Just Completely Screwed Him Over

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dg8g/matt-gaetzs-wingman-just-completely-screwed-him-over):

> After warning Gaetz not to go near the minor, Joel Greenberg promptly called the minor to "Confront" her, blaming the girl for her own apparent statutory rape, according to a confession letter written by Greenberg and obtained by the Daily Beast. Six hours later, Greenberg sent the girl and two other women a total of $900. Records obtained by the Daily Beast found that Greenberg paid dozens of young women over Venmo and the Cash App. "Congressman Gaetz has never paid for sex nor has he had sex with a 17-year-old as an adult. We are now one month after your outlet and others first reported such lies, and no one has gone on record to directly accuse him of either. Politico has reported Mr. Greenberg threatening to make false accusations against others, which seems noteworthy for your story and in fact sounds like the entirety of your story," Logan Circle Group, a public relations firm hired by Gaetz, told the Daily Beast.

## Biden says K-12 education isn't working — calls for free pre-K to "grade 14"

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-speech-education-free-pre-k-grade-14/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=117531622):

> Under the White House proposal, the nation's K-12 system would be expanded on both ends - from free pre-kindergarten education through a "Grade 14," funding two years of schooling before kindergarten and two years of post-high school education through free community college. Almost half of high school grads aren't working. About 6.2 million people said they weren't working in March because of remote school or the need to care for children not in school, according to Census data.

> Holy shit. This may be the first time I’ve witnessed democrats engage in good branding for their policies. We’re not giving free college, we’re simply expanding public education.
