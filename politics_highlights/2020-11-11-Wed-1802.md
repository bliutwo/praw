> It looks like Donald Trump’s next play will be to try and manipulate the electoral college by preventing or delaying the certification of results and working to have his electors appointed in states that he lost. *(he’s trying to create the legal situation and political climate needed to legitimize this situation)* 
> 
> It is said that GOP state legislatures may be able to use their power to aid Trump in this effort, and the GOP has already proven that traditions, precedents, and norms are not sacred to them in the slightest. 
> 
> How likely is this scenario to pan out for Donald Trump and what are the hurdles he faces in this strategy?

## Biden's Pennsylvania lead is now big enough to avoid an automatic recount

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/949468/bidens-pennsylvania-lead-now-big-enough-avoid-automatic-recount):

> President-elect Joe Biden's lead in Pennsylvania has, for now at least, cleared the state's automatic recount threshold. Theoretically, the number could shrink with more tallying underway, but Biden's lead is expected to continue going up, so President Trump or Pennsylvania voters will have to seek out a recount should he desire one. At this point, we're well out of automatic recount territory and Biden's lead is only going to continue to grow.

> No. Do another recount. I want to see them lose again.

## Photo resurfaces of Biden welcoming Pence to White House for ‘smooth transition of power’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/joe-biden-pence-white-house-2020-election-transition-b1720760.html):

> Included in that transition of power was then-Vice President Joe Biden meeting with Mike Pence. Now, four years later, President-elect Biden has started his transition into the White House without the assistance of the sitting president. Whether Mr Trump will concede and invite the incoming Biden administration to the White House ahead of 20 January remains unknown.

`/u/Treefrogprince` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jsh6z1/photo_resurfaces_of_biden_welcoming_pence_to/):

> That’s because Biden is a decent human being while Pence is an asshole.

## 'Very, highly unlikely' Trump wins Arizona, no evidence of fraud, state Republican attorney general says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/11/11/trump-unlikely-to-beat-biden-in-arizona-no-fraud-seen-state-ag-says.html?__twitter_impression=true):

> Even without Arizona, Biden currently is projected to win 279 Electoral College votes, nine more than he needs to deny the Republican incumbent a second White House term. "People voted for Republicans down ballot, but they didn't vote for President Trump, Martha McSally ... that's the reality," Brnovich said. As of Wednesday, she had 48.8% of the vote, compared to Democratic challenger Mark Kelly, who had 51.2% of the vote.

`/u/everyonewantsalog` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jsgwn9/very_highly_unlikely_trump_wins_arizona_no/):

> Guys, I'm starting to think that this whole "voter fraud" thing is a bunch of bullshit.

## So, Donald Trump … Lock Him Up? Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been criminally investigating Trump and the Trump Organization for more than two years.

Summary of [original article](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/so-donald-trump-lock-him-up/):

> That's the least of Trump's concerns, because unlike all of the people he made up lies about to further his political ambitions, it seems that Trump has committed multiple crimes, again and again, for decades. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been criminally investigating Trump and the Trump Organization for more than two years. A state level tax fraud investigation against Trump and the Trump Organization is already underway by New York's Attorney General Letitia James, who deposed Eric Trump in October as part of that probe.

`/u/DoDevilsEvenTriangle` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jsf5xr/so_donald_trump_lock_him_up_manhattan_district/):

> I want to thank Bob Mueller. He showed me why I shouldn't get my hopes up about anything, ever again. 
> 
> Now thanks to Mueller, nobody can tell me what Vance *might* do. I'm sure I won't miss the news report when Donald Trump or anyone in his family is dragged before a judge.
> 
> Really not going to listen until something actually goes down.

## Boris Johnson calls Trump "previous president"

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/boris-johnson-calls-trump-previous-president):

> LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called Donald Trump the "Previous president" of the United States and said it was "Refreshing" to talk to President-elect Joe Biden. Johnson told British lawmakers on Wednesday that he and Biden discussed plans to "Stick up for NATO and to work together in the fight against climate change" - issues on which Trump and the British leader have starkly different views. Jill Biden made military spouses and families one of her signature issues when Biden served as Barack Obama's vice president, and aides say that may be one of her focal points as first lady.
