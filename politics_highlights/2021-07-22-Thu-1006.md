> I loved watching Matt Gaetz die inside when that guy in the red white and blue costume kept bringing up pedophilia repeatedly while saying Matt was innocent of it.  But the word and the denials kept going on and on and on and pretty quick all you could think about was the allegations.  Watching Matty's face fall as he started realizing this was not such a good PR idea made my cold heart warm a bit.

## Mitch McConnell Dusts Off the GOP’s Debt Ceiling Scam: Republicans are pretending to be the party of fiscal responsibility again.

> "For the last 40 years, whenever a Republican is president, conservatives in Congress have happily embarked on a bacchanalia of tax cuts and hikes on defense spending. Whenever a Democrat takes office, the GOP suddenly rediscovers its commitment to austerity, bemoaning the debt being passed on to our children. This hypocrisy is particularly acute when it comes to the debt ceiling, a pointless procedural quirk that doesn’t increase spending but allow debts incurred by already approved spending to be paid off." — [Alex Shephard.](https://newrepublic.com/article/163022/mitch-mcconnell-dusts-off-gops-debt-ceiling-scam)

## Forgiving $50,000 in student loan debt can ‘transform an entire generation,’ Sen. Elizabeth Warren says

Summary of [original article](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/07/student-loan-forgiveness-2021-clearing-50000-in-debt-can-transform-an-entire-generation-massachusetts-sen-elizabeth-warren-says.html):

> "It would help nearly everyone who tried to go to college and it didn't work out - the 40% of student loan borrowers who do not have a college diploma and are truly struggling hard with student loan debt and would help a huge number of public school teachers and firefighters and people who want a chance to get out there and start their own businesses. It's the right number, it's where a lot of people intersect that we could transform an entire generation." If $50,000 in student loan debt is forgiven per borrower, 36 million Americans would be relieved of their student loan debt entirely, including 9.4 million in default. The Biden administration floated the possibility of canceling $10,000 in student loan debt which would wipe the debt of 15 million borrowers.

> I see it every day, I'll talk to a Millennial or GenZ and inevitably they'll state a problem they're having, I'll suggest they get help from some source that I used back when I had the problem and they'll explain that that help no longer exists.

## Washington DC Council Approves 'Transformational' Budget Including Tax Increase on Wealthy

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/21/washington-dc-council-approves-transformational-budget-including-tax-increase):

> The tax increase proposal was authored by Councilmembers Brianne K. Nadeau, Janeese Lewis George, and Charles Allen, who want to use the revenue to fund subsidies to raise wages for child care workers, more than 1,200 permanent housing vouchers to help residents facing homelessness or housing insecurity, and monthly tax credits for low-income households. Single people who earn between $250,000 and $500,000 per year will pay a marginal tax rate of 9.25%, up from 8.5%. People who make between $500,000 and $1 million will see their tax rate increase to 9.75% and those earning more than $1 million per year will pay a marginal rate of 10.75%. According to Allen, Lewis George, and Nadeau, the wealthiest people in the city will have to pay between $375 and $6,500 more per year in taxes. Some members of the council who opposed the tax increase claimed that raising taxes for the rich would make the city less "Attractive" to high earners and that a tax increase was inappropriate following an infusion of $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief.

## Alabama city leader who used n-word in council meeting says he won't apologize and might run for mayor

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tarrant-city-council-tommy-bryant-n-word-no-apology/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=125016061):

> TARRANT, Ala. - A White city leader captured on video using a racial slur toward Black people during a council meeting said he won't apologize, and might run for mayor. Tarrant City Council member Tommy Bryant told news outlets his use of the word Monday night reflected something the city's Black mayor, Wayman Newton, had said during an earlier private meeting. The mayor said the video speaks for itself and, in an interview with al.com, denied using the same slur Bryant uttered during the meeting.

> The mayor is the person he said it to...

> Literally the first Black mayor for that town as well.
