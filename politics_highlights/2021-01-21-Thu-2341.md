## Survivors demand Marjorie Taylor Green resign over more school shooting conspiracy comments

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-sandy-hook-b1791014.html):

> Gun control organisations and school shooting survivors have called for newly elected Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene to step down after more uncovered social media posts appear to show her supporting conspiracies that the 9-11 attacks were "Done by our own" government and that "None of the school shootings were real or done by the ones who were supposedly arrested for them." The right-wing media research group also found that she had replied to a Facebook comment in 2018 amplifying numerous conspiracies, including that the killing of 20 children and six school staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a "Staged" event, and that there are messages in the Georgia Guidestones, a granite monument in the state that has been central to several conspiracy theories. School shooting survivors as well as Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action - gun control advocacy groups that formed in the wake of several mass killings - have called for her resignation this week.

## No Mask, No Fly: Biden Signs Order Requiring Face Coverings On Planes

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/21/959398694/no-mask-no-fly-biden-signs-order-requiring-face-coverings-on-planes?utm_term=nprnews&utm_campaign=npr&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com):

> No Mask, No Fly: Biden Signs Order Requiring Face Coverings On Planes The executive order signed by President Biden Thursday also includes interstate travel on trains, buses and cruise ships, in a sharp reversal of the Trump administration's lax mask culture. The former president hosted huge rallies with like-minded supporters, often mocking Biden and others who wore masks, in spite of overwhelming evidence that properly worn face coverings significantly reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. Wednesday, as one of his first acts in the Oval Office, Biden signed an executive order requiring every government employee and visitor on federal lands and federal building to wear a face mask.

> Drive the point home, mercilessly, that they grew the deficit, exponentially, over the last 4 years. Largely to line the pockets of the billionaire class. Their ACTUAL base. Say it every time they pull this shit. Don't let them get away with it.
