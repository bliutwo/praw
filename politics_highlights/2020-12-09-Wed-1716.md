Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/congressional-democrats-are-now-investigating-whether-kushner-used-trump-to-get-himself-a-billion-dollar-qatari-bailout/):

> The latest investigation looks into whether Kushner pushed his father-in-law Trump to support a Qatari blockade while Kushner Companies sought a more than billion-dollar bailout from officials from that and other Middle Eastern governments. "We write to seek information on any ethics guidance that has been provided to Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner on potential conflicts of interest related to Kushner Companies, a real estate company owned and operated by his family in which he remains a significant investor," Wyden, D-Oregon, and Castro, D-Texas, wrote in a 4-page letter to Trump's senior counsel Scott Gast, at the Office of White House Counsel. "During negotiations with Kushner Companies, were any representatives from Brookfield Asset Management aware that Mr. Kushner and his family had held previous discussions with Qatari government officials and businessmen, including the April 24, 2017 meeting between Charles Kushner and Minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi?" the first question asked.

## Trump voters don't really believe Biden stole the election — but they do want a coup

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/12/09/trump-voters-dont-really-believe-biden-stole-the-election---but-they-do-want-a-coup/):

> Do Republican voters really believe that Joe Biden stole the election from Donald Trump? Do they sincerely see Trump's efforts to overturn the election as the legitimate actions of a wronged man trying to defend democracy? When they declare "Stop the steal," are they truly unaware that they are the ones trying to steal this election from the rightful winners? Or are millions of Americans arguing in bad faith, merely claiming to believe Trump is the true winner? Is this all just a disingenuous song-and-dance, meant to put a morally justifiable gloss on what is actually widespread support among Trump voters for a coup? The answer to this question of "Delusion or bad faith?" matters quite a bit, as Trump continues to prosecute his futile campaign to steal the 2020 election. Well, as the author of a book called "Troll Nation," it's clear where I stand: By and large, Republican voters who claim that Biden stole the election are arguing from bad faith, not delusion.

> > Conservatives don't hold beliefs, they only have rationalizations.   
> >  
> > Many of their long-standing beliefs don't hold up to modern moral standards or rational scrutiny. Rather than give up those beliefs, however, Republicans have developed a series of disingenuous gambits, conspiracy theories and trolling tactics to derail conversations, sow confusion and otherwise distract those who would challenge their indefensible ideology.

> That nicely summarized their entire platform.

`/u/Karmakazee` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ka1t4t/the_trumps_are_reportedly_preparing_to_move_out/):

> >	Back in April, Melania Trump brought on a special, unpaid government employee — former White House Office of Administration head Marcia Lee Kelly — who has since been helping the Trumps on their outward transition. Among the first lady's reported tasks for Kelly was asking around in the White House to find out whether she'll get any perks once she leaves the White House. The president will get some benefits, but Melania will only get a $20,000-a-year pension if he dies.
> 
> Here’s hoping she ends up scrounging to make ends meet on $1667 a month when all is said and done.

## Covid made Mitch McConnell's 'grim reaper' nickname into reality. McConnell’s Covid-19 inaction shows he’s perfectly willing to inflict pain and suffering on millions of Americans.

Summary of [original article](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/covid-made-mitch-mcconnell-s-grim-reaper-nickname-reality-n1250219):

> His name is Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.The Senate Majority Leader continues to sit on his hands as more Americans die on a daily basis from Covid-19 than died in the Twin Towers. Today, McConnell is the grim reaper in a much more literal sense. Writing in The New York Times, conservative columnist David Brooks declared that if McConnell fails to pass a Covid-19 relief bill in the coming days and weeks, he should "Spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused." But what if empathy is beyond the grim reaper?

> Insane how one senator from Kentucky can hold the entire government hostage, and stay locked in to power by an electorate he's not even popular with but who keeps voting for him because he's not a Democrat. KY has stayed poor as shit under McConnell but they don't seem to care.

> Edit: I get it, he’s the heel
