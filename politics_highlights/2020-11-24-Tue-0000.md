> This week, WA state’s own Trump mini-me, Loren Culp, has still refused to [concede the gubernatorial election](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/loren-culp-refusing-to-concede-washington-gubernatorial-race-turns-on-top-republicans/) to incumbent (and decisive winner), Gov. Jay Inslee. In a “statement”(read: online rant), Culp attacked WASoS Kim Wyman for “pushing this vote-by-mail crap” on Washingtonians, who have voted universally by mail since [2011.](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5124-S.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%2010%20%C2%A7%2035;)

> Meanwhile, Gov. Inslee has [reinstituted COVID restrictions](https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-statewide-restrictions-four-weeks), re-closing dinning rooms, movie theaters, weddings/funerals, and other non-essential gathering points. He also announced a cap on [third-party delivery fees](https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-cap-third-party-delivery-fees-help-restaurants) (much to my wallet’s pleasure) and [$135 million](https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-additional-covid-19-financial-support) in financial support for businesses, rent relief, recovery loans, and energy bill relief for low-income WA families.

`/u/CDC_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jztvos/megathread_the_gsa_has_informed_presidentelect/):

> I want to thank Donald Trump for getting me so interested in politics. Before he began running, I was a casual observer. I was a registered Democrat, I voted, but didnt really pay attention.
> 
> Now? I not only know what the GSA is, I know the dates every state certifies their election, when the electoral college votes, how the electoral college works, why we should get rid of it, who Vladimir Putin is and why he’s a bad guy, what the senate and House of Representatives do, the entirety of the Watergate scandal, why it’s really dumb that Republicans calls themselves the party of Lincoln, why Mitch McConnell is the biggest douche in the universe, how easily fascism can rise and why we should fear it, and tons of other things.

## Ironically enough, it’s Rudy Giuliani who has ties to Venezuela

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rudy-giuliani-chavez-venezuela-dominion-smartmatic-trump-b1760036.html):

> Before doing so, Giuliani already had a relationship with Betancourt, having stayed at his estate in Madrid as Giuliani worked to get dirt on Ukrainian-linked corruption and Joe Biden, per Trump's request. Interestingly enough, Giuliani was even wearing chavista ally Betancourt's Spain-based brand of eyeglasses, Hawkers, as he went on about a chavista conspiracy to rig the US election against Trump last week. As Trump's presidency crumbles in an embarrassing array of conspiracy theories and sketchy characters, he and Giuliani make a mockery of Venezuelan tragedy in the process.

`/u/beaucephus` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jzuc80/ironically_enough_its_rudy_giuliani_who_has_ties/):

> It's not ironic. It's Republican hypocrisy. It's their entire identity.

> Was it the botched Hunter Biden “scandal”? Or the embarrassing Borat footage? Or the complete lack of knowledge or procedure in the submitted lawsuit complaints? Or the hair dye?
> 
> God. That’s just the past 3 months.

## Trump campaign loses 5 more cases in Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision

Summary of [original article](https://6abc.com/election-results-donald-trump-joe-biden-pennsylvania/8210226/):

> Three justices wrote in the majority that, "No allegations of fraud or illegality" came up in examination of the ballots. In one separate opinion, Justice David N. Wecht wrote that while he agrees technically deficient ballots should be counted this year, he does not believe the absence of a date on the declaration "Should be overlooked as a 'minor irregularity.'". In a second concurring, dissenting opinion, Justice Kevin M. Dougherty, joined by Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor and Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, wrote that the justices agreed the deficient ballots should be counted this year and that ballots missing "Fill out" information, such as printed name or address, should not be voided due to technical faults.
