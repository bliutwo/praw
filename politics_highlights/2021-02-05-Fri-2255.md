Fifty-one percent of respondents said that they disapprove of the former president, while 47 percent said they disapprove of the state's Sen.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-fireside-chats-b1798493.html):

> Joe Biden will resume weekly presidential addresses after Donald Trump ended the tradition during his term. "President Biden will continue that tradition, and we expect it to take on a variety of forms."

> I have been thinking this would be a really good moment history for the President to revive this concept, in a modern framework. Put him in our living room every Sunday, and allow people to develop an empathic connection with him. I hope it works, I feel like it is time for it.

## Biden Tosses Out Trump's Last-Minute Judicial Nominations

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-judicial-nominees_n_601c8e04c5b68e068fbcf08f):

> Late Thursday, with little fanfare, President Joe Biden withdrew 32 nominations from the Senate that former President Donald Trump put forward in his final days in office. The fact that Biden sent back both of Trump's judicial picks is a sign that he isn't ceding any ground when it comes to filling lifetime federal court seats  not after Trump and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spent the last four years focused on confirming more than 230 mostly young, male, white, right-wing judges. While judges in lifetime seats have personal reasons for retiring when they do, it's safe to say, for the most part, that the timing of these judges' departures isn't coincidental: They wanted Biden to pick their replacements, not Trump.
