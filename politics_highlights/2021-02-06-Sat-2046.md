> TBF they didn't hide that; I'm pretty sure the fine print on the solicitations said that any gifts under ~$5000 would be used to "retire debt" or something.

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/05/adam-kinzinger-says-marjorie-taylor-greene-shows-no-remorse/4406217001/):

> More:House removes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from committees over incendiary social media posts. GOP two-step: Republicans keep faith with Donald Trump in backing of Marjorie Taylor Greene. Maura Gillespie, Kinzinger's communications director, told USA TODAY the Illinois congressman "Has said from day one that QAnon has no place in Congress. And while he respects the voice of the people and their right to elect Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, he does not agree with the decision to give her a committee seat."

## Trumpâ€™s lie that the election was stolen has cost $519 million (and counting) as taxpayers fund enhanced security, legal fees, property repairs and more

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/cost-trump-election-fraud/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR1Zka1ssCQrjrVBpzgkdn_dO9eeTRPSn-kGPiGeVBBB8Fqv9Dn-TP2Zny0):

> Others have given up on trying to calculate their costs - perplexed over how to calculate the financial impact of a president's injecting so much instability into the democratic system - opting instead to simply absorb them as the cost of doing business in the Trump era. Between added legal fees to fend off conspiracy-theory-laced lawsuits from Trump and enhanced security for election officials, states' costs resulting from the president's central fabrication about the Nov. 3 vote have escalated rapidly. Not included in the more than $4 million estimated security bill for Washington state taxpayers is the yet-to-be-determined cost of fixing a gate at the governor's mansion broken by armed demonstrators on Jan. 6."Not only have our people, places and processes of democracy been attacked and damaged, but the continuing expense of this new security environment will take away from funds that could have been used for covid vaccines and treatment" and other critical expenses, Loftis said.

## Republicans are fleeing the GOP because of Trump but the rot started long before he was president â€” George W. Bush was politicizing science, empowering the religious right, and torturing brown people years before Trump ever took office.

> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE "FLEEING" THE GOP.
> 
> Let's be clear about this--less than 1% of Republicans have switched parties since the riots. Most of them switched to independent, not third party. There is currently ZERO evidence that there is a movement underway for Republicans to abandon the GOP in mass. 
> 
> This is an unhelpful narrative driven by Democratic wishful thinking.

## Rep. Val Demings Says Trump Would Sell Intelligence Briefings Info to 'the Highest Bidder'

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/rep-val-demings-says-trump-would-sell-intelligence-briefings-info-highest-bidder-1567351):

> Florida Democratic Representative Val Demings said Saturday that she believes former President Donald Trump would sell U.S. intelligence briefings, if given the chance. "I believe this former president, and I believe it with all of my heart, would use intelligence as a bargaining chip or sell it to the highest bidder," Demings said during an interview on MSNBC. "We don't trust our former president, and neither do many of our allies around the world," added Demings, who serves on the House's Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Intelligence committees. Demings' remarks come after President Joe Biden said that there is "No need" for Trump to continue receiving intelligence briefings following his departure from office.

We've seen him on a phone call with the Russian dictator and refuse to ask him about bounties put on the heads of American soldiers," she said.
> 
> > "We've seen him snuggle up with Kim Jong Un of North Korea," she added. "There is no circumstance where the former president should receive any intelligence. Not now or quite frankly, in the future."
> 
> Amen! He couldnâ€™t be trusted while in office. With a lot of eyes off of him now, weâ€™re supposed to believe he wonâ€™t try to capitalize off this info?! Fat Chance! Time to cut him off!!!  ðŸ˜¤

## Trump's Pal Roger Stone Caught Hanging With Oath Keepers Before Capitol Attack

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-oath-keepers-video-investigation_n_601e3cc3c5b6173dd2f63204):

> Longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone was captured on a video obtained by ABC News flanked by members of the right-wing extremist Oath Keepers the morning of the storming of Capitol that cost five lives. As for the Oath Keepers with him outside the hotel, Stone told ABC: "I could not even tell you the names of those who volunteered to provide security for me." Vice News reported last month that members of the Oath Keepers appeared to have official passes hanging from their necks providing special access the day before and the day of the Capitol attack.
