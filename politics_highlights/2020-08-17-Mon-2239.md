> I'm a Bernie superfan. And I have to say that there is literally zero shot to get any progressive policies passed if Trump gets reelected.
> 
> I'm voting for Joe Biden because if we return to an America that is at least relatively sane, we can move forward to push the policies that Americans really want. If we keep dealing with Trump's bullshit every day we will never focus on what is important.

## 'I Hope the Postmaster General Comes Prepared. I Know I Will,' Says Rep. Katie Porter as DeJoy Agrees to Testify on USPS Changes

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/17/i-hope-postmaster-general-comes-prepared-i-know-i-will-says-rep-katie-porter-dejoy):

> Following demands by top congressional Democrats that he testify before the House Oversight Committee, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's office announced Monday that he will appear at a hearing August 24. "I hope the Postmaster General comes prepared," committee member Rep. Katie Porter tweeted Monday afternoon. Top Democrats in both the U.S. House and Senate called on DeJoy to explain his actions as the USPS warned 46 states last week that it may not have capacity to get mail-in ballots sent by voters to their polling locations in time to be counted this November, and activists are organizing protests to #SaveTheUSPS. "The American people want their mail, medicines, and mail-in ballots delivered in a timely way," Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, chair of the Oversight Committee, said Monday in a statement announcing the August 24 hearing.

> Katie Porter is boss AF. This will be good.
