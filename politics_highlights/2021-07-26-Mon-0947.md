Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/arkansas-governor-people-call-vaccine-a-bioweapon-mind-control-2021-7):

> Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he is working against misinformation as he travels around the state urging residents to get the COVID-19 vaccine. "As I go into these town-hall meetings, someone said, 'Don't call it a vaccine, call it a bioweapon.' And they talk about mind control," Hutchinson said. Hutchinson also said Sunday that the rise in cases, especially as young people are being more affected, could encourage more people to get vaccinated.

## Schumer calls Out Manchin, Sinema over filibuster, voting rights: "Get this done"

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/schumer-calls-out-manchin-sinema-over-filibuster-voting-rights-get-this-done-1612278):

> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called out moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona over their continued opposition to ending the filibuster, which is viewed as the main impediment to passing major voting rights legislation. "We have all but two Democrats who have said they would not use the filibuster on voting rights. There may be a few others who haven't taken a position, but two said, no. They're Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema," Schumer said during a Thursday interview with SiriusXM's The Joe Madison Show. "And Manchin because of all the activity of the civil rights community, who I'm working very closely with Stacey Abrams, Barack Obama, Manchin now put out what he's for, which isn't bad," Schumer said on The Joe Madison Show.

`/u/PayMe2Shill4U` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/orx9dq/schumer_calls_out_manchin_sinema_over_filibuster/):

> Sinema is being blackmailed and/or has a major fucking screw loose. I think Manchin is just a typical corrupt West Virginian machine politics piece of shit.
> 
> Neither of them gives a flying fuck at a donut about the country and waiting for them to do the right thing is about as worthy an endeavor as taking the aforementioned flying fuck. Now I don't care if it _is_ a jelly donut. It ain't gonna fix the country if you stick your dick in it.

## FBI Got 4,500 Tips In Kavanaugh Investigation That It Never Actually Performed

Summary of [original article](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/fbi-got-4500-tips-in-kavanaugh-investigation-that-it-never-actually-performed/):

> Most of the letter is dancing around how the FBI is mostly a bystander in these matters - an excuse that would hold up better had "We'll have the FBI figure this out" not been the crux of the Senate decision to postpone the vote. "The admissions in your letter corroborate and explain numerous credible accounts by individuals and firms that they had contacted the FBI with information 'highly relevant to ... allegations' of sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh, only to be ignored," they wrote in a letter back to the FBI. "If the FBI was not authorized to or did not follow up on any of the tips that it received from the tip line, it is difficult to understand the point of having a tip line at all," they said. The point of the tip line was political theater to get the heat off for a couple of weeks before using the fact that the FBI never found anything as justification to move forward.

> I think that this may be grounds for delegitimizing Kavanaugh's confirmation, possibly in preparation to kick him off.
> 
> The SCOTUS needs to be squeaky clean in order for the people to trust the justice system. Things like this just raises doubts, especially if he was placed there by a president with a record of quid-pro-quo.
> 
> Meanwhile, I'm grabbing the popcorn and watching how this plays out.

## Banks Really Don’t Like Biden’s Push to Make It Easier to Move Your Money

> > The order—which Biden signed to much fanfare in a White House ceremony—encourages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Wall Street watchdog created after the 2008 financial crisis, to issue rules that will make it easier for people to transfer their personal financial data between institutions. Practically, that would mean pieces of a person’s digital financial life—including transaction history, automatic bill pay setups, direct deposits, and more—could be moved with a few clicks to companies other than big banks, such as community banks, credit unions, or “fintech” apps that allow customers to perform banking functions from their phones or computers. 
> 
> 
> > That might not sound like a big deal. Or it may sound like it’s already happening, as many consumers invest their money with robo-advisers like Betterment or link their financial accounts to budget trackers like Mint. But it’s a move that big banks have long seen as something of an existential threat. Their fear is that if customers can easily move their money and information between institutions, then fintech companies taking an innovative approach to banking and consumer finance will siphon off customers, shrinking the market share and political standing of major banks. In January, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, summed up the banking sector’s fears of fintech: “Absolutely, we should be scared shitless.”

## Michigan Politicians, All Republicans, Pocket Thousands in Bonuses From Federal Covid Relief Funds

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/michigan-republicans-federal-covid-relief-1201961/):

> Republican elected officials in a Michigan county voted to allot themselves hefty payments in the form of "Covid hazard pay" from American Rescue Plan funds designated for essential workers, only returning the funds under public pressure and a lawsuit. The funds were part of $557,000 of American Rescue Plan funds earmarked for hazard pay, and elected officials allocated "The bulk" of the funds to themselves, the Argus-Press in Ossowa, Mich., reported. These payments to elected and appointed officials likely violate both the Michigan constitution and the federal rules for ARP funds.
