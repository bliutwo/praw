> “**It’s mind-blowing that you can’t get the government to improve the  testing because they just want to say how great it is**,” he continued.  “I’ve said to them, look, have a CDC website that prioritizes who gets  tested. Don’t reimburse any test where the result goes back after three  days. **You’re paying billions of dollars in this very inequitable way to  get the most worthless testing results in the world**.”

## “Absurdly Unconstitutional”: Trump Bypasses Congress From His Private Golf Club

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/08/absurdly-unconstitutional-trump-bypasses-congress-from-his-private-golf-club):

> President Donald Trump responded to collapsed stimulus talks with a series of executive actions undermining Congressional power that are unlikely to provide substantial economic relief and may face legal challenges. Trump said he would bypass Congress during a news event held at his private New Jersey golf club, where members cheered him on as he signed orders on unemployment, evictions, students loans, and payroll tax, which he claimed "Will take care of pretty much this entire situation," according to the Washington Post. "Major changes to the tax code fall entirely to Congress, so Trump alone cannot waive Americans' tax debts or enact permanent changes to tax law," the Post notes.

> Imagine how badly this is going to backfire for the GOP when the democrats take control and they have a precedent to point to for expanded presidential power.

## Critics of Trump White House decry latest ‘Friday night massacre’ as postmaster general sidelines two dozen USPS officials

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/critics-of-trump-white-house-decry-latest-friday-night-massacre-as-postmaster-general-sidelines-two-dozen-usps-officials-2020-08-09?link=MW_latest_news):

> The agency's new leader, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a former supply-chain CEO and a major donor to Trump and other Republicans, has pushed cost-cutting measures to eliminate overtime pay and hold mail until the next day if postal distribution centers are running late. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee. "Without dramatic change, there is no end in sight, and we face an impending liquidity crisis," DeJoy told the Postal Service's governing board Friday, before news emerged that evening that DeJoy had jettisoned or reassigned some two dozen top officials.

> 
> You don't have to be a Trump critic to see how insane that is... 90 days before an election that will have record mail-in ballots.

## Democrats in Wisconsin have asked state officials to block Kanye West from standing, claiming that he used bogus signatures like 'Mickey Mouse' and 'Bernie Sanders'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-complain-kanye-west-submitted-wisconsin-papers-late-bogus-signatures-2020-8):

> The Democratic Party in Wisconsin is urging state officials to block Kanye West from being on the state's presidential election ballot in November, claiming that he submitted his nomination papers late and used bogus signatures. The complaint also alleged that West's papers included bogus signatures and addresses. She said in her affidavit: "If I had known that, I wouldn't have signed the papers, absolutely not... Kanye West would not get my vote and I think it is a joke that he is running for president."

`/u/tbizzone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i6k1rd/democrats_in_wisconsin_have_asked_state_officials/):

> If the paperwork was submitted after the deadline, that should be the end of discussion. The false signatures are just more evidence that this shouldn’t be taken seriously.

## Russia is actively helping Trump. Again.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/09/russia-is-actively-helping-trump-again/):

> To be clear: China, according to the administration, prefers Biden but Russia, just as it did in 2016, is working actively to elect Trump. Why shouldn't Moscow go all in for Trump once more? After all, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gotten much of what he wants from Trump: delegitimization of Western democracies, a pass on bounties on U.S. troops, frayed relations within NATO, withdrawal of U.S. troops from Germany, cover for Putin's interference in our 2016 elections. Russia and strongmen around the world have gotten a pass over and over again from Trump on human rights.

`/u/Dimeskis` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i6k2ho/russia_is_actively_helping_trump_again/):

> So in 2020 being marshmallow soft on Russia doesn't matter, but being tough on China does...got it.  
> 
> I'm glad that every 4 years the Repulicans are able to classify what nation is to be feared the most that only they are equipped to handle.
