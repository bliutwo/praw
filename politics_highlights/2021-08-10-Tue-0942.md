> A real estate investor, YouTuber, and gubernatorial candidate. After working at Jamba Juice and Red Robin while attending Buena High School, I bought my first home at 19 and became a real estate agent with my now-wife, Lauren, who worked at Mrs. Fields in the Pacific View Mall and became a property manager. 2 years later and while attending UCLA for economics, accounting, and political science, I became a real estate broker and opened my own company, Meet Kevin, The No-Pressure Agent.

## Florida’s Death Toll Now Exceeds DeSantis’ Margin of Victory

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/floridas-death-toll-now-exceeds-desantis-margin-of-victory):

> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made a big bet that keeping Florida open and fighting mask mandates would be political gold, and for a time it looked like he was winning that bet. To understand how venomous DeSantis has made mask-wearing, two days after the nine-person Broward school board voted, on the day that Florida had its highest count to that date of new COVID cases, DeSantis signed an executive order empowering the state Board of Education to withhold funding from any school district forcing students to wear masks. Florida now accounts for about one in five COVID cases, prompting President Biden's assertion last week that governors who are not helping restrain the virus "Should get out of the way." DeSantis looked like a man desperate to find a way to avoid blame and he latched on immigrants coming across the Mexican border as the alleged source of new COVID cases, accusing the president of "Trying to single out Florida over COVID" and "Facilitating" the spread of the virus.

`/u/VineStGuy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1n0he/floridas_death_toll_now_exceeds_desantis_margin/):

> I watched a FL Superintendent on MSNBC this morning that said, she issued the mask mandate bc in the last 2 weeks, 2 teachers have died with many sick or in quarantine and can't work. Deathsantis issued a statement that he'll pull her funding for the mask mandate. I never ever EVER want to hear any republican claim we need to do something for the best interest of the children. As far as I'm concerned they've lost all rights to even be taken seriously about anything.

## Dominion sues OAN for promoting false statements about the election and seeks more than $1.6 billion in damages

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/dominion-sues-oan-one-america-news-election-conspiracy-theories-2021-3):

> Dominion Voting Systems sued One America News Network on Tuesday, accusing the far-right media organization of defamation for pushing far-fetched conspiracy theories that the election technology company rigged the 2020 presidential election. At the same time, OAN quietly scrubbed its website of references to election conspiracy theories, Dominion, and Smartmatic, another election technology company. Dominion suggested in its lawsuit against Lindell that it would soon sue OAN. OAN had aired "Absolute Proof," a conspiracy theory-filled "Docu-movie" Lindell produced in an attempt to change the results of the election.

`/u/AFlockOfTySegalls` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1ousw/dominion_sues_oan_for_promoting_false_statements/):

> > It went on to accuse OAN and Rion of "producing an entire line of programming exclusively devoted to defaming Dominion, descriptively named 'Dominion-izing the Vote,' which branded OAN's disinformation and defamation campaign against Dominion into a single catchy phrase that is now synonymous with fraudulently flipping votes."
> 
> Fuck them UP. I'd love it if Dominion could litigate OAN into no longer existing.

## Lauren Boebert's midnight run: Capitol tour happened after she attended "Stop the Steal" rally | Boebert was in D.C. to attend "Million MAGA March" when she took her family on unexplained midnight Capitol tour

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/08/10/lauren-boeberts-midnight-run-capitol-tour-happened-after-she-attended-stop-the-steal-rally/):

> Evidence suggests that the Capitol tour itself - involving Boebert, her mother, her teenage son and a Capitol Police officer - apparently took place close to midnight, at an hour when the Capitol complex is normally completely shut down. None of the Boebert group's photos from the tour show any other people present in the Capitol building, except for the single police officer who accompanied the group to the observation deck overlooking the city. Earlier, Boebert had attended the first "Stop the Steal" rally in D.C. on Nov. 14, according to a tweet from co-organizer Kylie Jane Kremer.

`/u/RatedEforEric` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1nlqk/lauren_boeberts_midnight_run_capitol_tour/):

> I hope she’s proud of what her neo-Nazi political allies did on January 6.

## Since 1978, CEO Pay Has Risen 1,322%. Typical Worker Pay? Just 18% | "The economy would suffer no harm if CEOs were paid less (or were taxed more)."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/08/10/1978-ceo-pay-has-risen-1322-typical-worker-pay-just-18):

> A new analysis released Tuesday by the Economic Policy Institute finds that CEO pay in the United States rose by a staggering 1,322% between 1978 and 2020-a sharp contrast to the pay increase of the typical worker, which was just 18% during that same period. In 2020, a year of pandemic and widespread economic dislocation, the top executives at the largest public firms in the U.S. were paid 351 times as much as the typical worker, with CEO pay measured by salary, bonuses, long-term incentive payouts, and exercised stock options. In its new analysis, EPI points out that the 1,322% CEO pay jump between 1978 and 2020 far outstripped the 817% growth in the S&P stock market during that same period.

`/u/Yeeslander` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1o8ea/since_1978_ceo_pay_has_risen_1322_typical_worker/):

> >"CEOs are getting more because of their power to set pay and because so much of their pay (more than 80%) is **stock-related**, not because they are increasing their productivity or possess specific, high-demand skills," Mishel and Kandra write.
> 
> Just throwing this out there for the conservative billionaire apologists who stand on the principle that "they earned it".
