## Arizona Democrats threaten “no confidence” vote against Sinema as she blocks tax hikes

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/09/27/arizona-democrats-threaten-no-confidence-vote-against-sinema-as-she-blocks-hikes/):

> The Arizona Democratic Party on Saturday passed a resolution threatening a no-confidence vote against Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., if she does not support the party's agenda and the elimination of the filibuster. More than 80% of the party voted in favor of the resolution, according to Democratic organizer Kai Newkirk, which pledged to "Officially go on the record" with a vote of no confidence if Sinema does not reverse her support for the filibuster, which it described as a "Jim Crow relic," or "Continues to delay, disrupt, or votes to gut" President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion spending plan. Sinema also opposes Democrats' proposals to raise the income tax rate on the wealthy from 37% to 39.6% as well as an increase to the corporate tax rate, which was lowered under the Republican tax cuts enacted under Donald Trump in 2017, according to The New York Times.

> Sinema told White House officials that she opposes House and Senate bills that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug costs, sources told Politico this week.

## Joe Manchin, who is holding up crucial climate change initiatives in Biden's reconciliation bill, collects $500,000 a year from coal stocks dividends: report

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/senator-joe-manchin-half-million-year-coal-stocks-climate-crisis-2021-9):

> Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has in his own words "Never been in a liberal in any way shape or form," is currently holding up the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that central to President Joe Biden's "Build Back Better" domestic agenda. As The Guardian reported in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy in July, Manchin himself founded a private coal brokerage in 1998 called "Enersystems." Though currently run by his son, Manchin still owns as much as a $5 million stake in the company, raking in $500,000 of income from it in 2020 alone. Manchin serves as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees the coal industry as well as "Global climate change." As Sludge reported in early July, Manchin told the 2021 annual conference of the Edison Electric Institute in June that "Coal-fired plants are being unfairly targeted by environmentalists."

## Surprise: Ivanka Trump Was Responsible for Her Father’s Disastrous COVID Address

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/ivanka-trump-stephanie-grisham-covid-address#intcid=recommendations_vf-trending-legacy_6ea34481-13b5-4aea-a668-649b31d7f857_popular4-1):

> As the old saying goes, behind every great man is a great woman, though for the Trump era, the more appropriate adage would be, "Behind every presidential fuckup is a first daughter and son-in-law who have no idea what they're doing but nevertheless think they should be advising the leader of the free world." That's not at all to say that Donald Trump wasn't perfectly capable of destroying the country himself, just that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner clearly helped things along. Ivanka, the women's rights / small-business / crisis communications / and now COVID expert, just kept repeating, "There should be an address from the Oval.". Finally, Ivanka turned to her most powerful ally besides her father.

> >On another occasion around the new year, a young boy started publicly challenging Trump to go vegan in TV ads and on highway billboards. If the president agreed, the boy said, the charity he represented would donate $1 million to veterans.

> 
> Even Donald Trump realizes he's only just barely a functioning adult.

## Turns Out Most Americans Will Get the COVID-19 Vaccine to Keep Their Job

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/09/most-americans-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-to-keep-their-job-tyson-united):

> After months of advertising campaigns, lottery entries, gimmicky incentives, and outright pleas for Americans to get their COVID-19 shots, the White House, local governments, and businesses finally started getting tough, with vaccine mandates from Joe Biden, local leaders, and corporations taking effect across the country. "Holding firm on the vaccine mandate for health care workers is simply the right thing to do to protect our vulnerable family members and loved ones from COVID-19," said New York Governor Kathy Hochul, noting that those numbers have spiked in the past month. If mandates are similarly effective at other large businesses, which will have vaccine mandates or stringent testing requirements under the plan Biden announced earlier this month, it could have a profound impact on the battle against the pandemic.

## Rudy Giuliani admits under oath that he got some of his 'evidence' of alleged election fraud from Facebook

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/rudy-guiliani-says-he-got-election-fraud-evidence-from-facebook-2021-10):

> Rudy Giuliani admitted under oath that his "Evidence" of voter fraud in the 2020 election came partly from Facebook and that he did not interview or fact-check his sources, reports say. In the deposition, Giuliani admitted that he got some of his information about Coomer's alleged role in the election fraud from his social media posts but couldn't be sure if it was Facebook or another platform, MSNBC said. The Justice Department has said it found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, and dozens of lawsuits challenging the results of the 2020 election have failed.

## Sinema Leaves DC for High-End Corporate Fundraiser as She Blocks Biden Spending Bill

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/sinema-leaves-dc-for-high-end-corporate-fundraiser-as-she-blocks-biden-spending-bill/):

> As Congressional Democrats frantically tried to reach agreement on passing President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion social spending bill, Kyrsten Sinema, one of the key moderates blocking the Build Back Better Act, abruptly left Washington DC for Arizona on Friday. It's the second time in a week Sinema will have fundraised with corporate interests who oppose Biden's spending bill. Sinema has told the White House she opposes the $3.5 trillion spending plan and has reportedly been working to take out key provisions such as raising tax rates on corporations and wealthy Americans and lowering prescription drug prices-policies that are very popular with the public but opposed by the corporate interests funding Sinema's campaigns.

> In professional sports, there have been team members who intentionally lose the game in order to make a personal profit.  They usually don’t last very long in the sport.
> 
> In this case, we know why Sinema is sabotaging the game, and it’s not over yet.  We’ve uncovered her donors, and her motives.  
> 
> Perhaps, the only thing bright about Senator Sinema is her wardrobe….
>
