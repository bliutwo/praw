## My name is Tammy Duckworth, and I lived on food stamps as a teenager, grew up to become an Army Black Hawk pilot, got shot down in Iraq, lost my legs, and then became a mother and a U.S. Senator. AMA.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n5jeio/my_name_is_tammy_duckworth_and_i_lived_on_food/):

> Hi, Reddit! My name is Tammy Duckworth, and although I'm a U.S. Senator now, I never imagined I'd become a politician. We lived on food stamps there, and I handed out booze cruise flyers and sold roses by the side of the road to support my family. In 2004, I deployed to Iraq, where my Black Hawk was shot down by an enemy RPG that blew into the cockpit and exploded in my lap.

## 'Let's Do Insulin Next,' Says Ocasio-Cortez After Biden Backs IP Waiver to Boost Covid-19 Vaccine Access

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/05/05/lets-do-insulin-next-says-ocasio-cortez-after-biden-backs-ip-waiver-boost-covid-19):

> "Let's do insulin next," tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described "Unapologetic advocate of Medicare for All" who also "Believes that all people must have access to safe and affordable prescription medications." Reporting last year on how the U.S. patent system is a barrier to cheaper insulin, Healthline explained that "Drug manufacturers have repeatedly made lots of little changes to their existing insulin products in order to apply for new patents on them." Banting's co-inventors, James Collip and Charles Best, sold the insulin patent to the University of Toronto for a mere $1. They wanted everyone who needed their medication to be able to afford it.

> Unfortunately the problem with insulin prices is not quite the same thing as the covid vaccine. Insulin is an old drug that technically isn't under patent, but drug companies make money off it by selling more recently developed formulations of it that work better. You can get some older formulations for really cheap, but drug companies can still gouge on those, too.

## Biden launches a fiery defense of his tax hikes: 'This is about making the average multimillionaire pay just a fair share'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-defends-tax-increases-average-multimillionaire-whispered-wealth-infrastructure-2021-5):

> While answering questions after a Wednesday address on the impact of the American Rescue Plan, President Joe Biden doubled down on his tax proposals and the need for wealthier Americans and corporations to pay their fair share - and took aim at prior Republican tax cuts. Those include raising the income tax rate for the wealthiest Americans to 39.6%, bringing up the capital gains rate to the same level, and increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The corporate tax rate was one measure that was slashed under Trump's tax package, falling from 35% to 21%. Biden said he was open to compromising on the corporate tax rate - some Democrats have floated an increase to 25%, instead of 28% - but said he still wants to offset spending. Overall, the tax burden of Biden's proposal would fall squarely on the top 1% of American tax filers, who would pay an average additional $100,000 per year.

> GOP:  Tax cuts for corporations and millionaires?  Yes.  Raising the national deficit by $2Trillion for those GOP tax cuts?  Yes.  Raising taxes on the wealthy and holding corporations accountable so we can help the working class?  No!

## US announces support for patent waiver on Covid vaccines

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-covid-vaccine-patent-waiver-b1842731.html):

> Facing questions about US support for the proposal as India and South America face alarming rates of infections, White House officials in recent days have pointed to other efforts to expand global vaccine production and distribution, with a patent waiver representing only a partial solution. The Gates Foundation said in a statement that the organisation is "Focused on the policy and process barriers that stand in the way of equitable access to vaccines", leaving the waiver decision up to the WTO. In March, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked: "If a temporary waiver to patents cannot be issued now, during these unprecedented times, when will be the right time?". Senator Bernie Sanders, who has joined congressional Democrats to reverse the US position on patent waivers, told NBC's Meet the Press that "There is something morally objectionable about rich countries being able to get that vaccine, and yet millions and billions of people in poor countries are unable to afford it."
