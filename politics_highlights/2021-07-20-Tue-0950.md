## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 29

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/onh6zl/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

## ‘If anybody is lying here senator, it is you,’ Fauci tells Sen. Paul in heated exchange at Senate hearing

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/if-anybody-is-lying-here-senator-it-is-you-fauci-tells-sen-paul-in-heated-exchange-at-senate-hearing.html):

> White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul traded barbs in a heated exchange at a Senate hearing Tuesday over whether the National Institutes of Health funded controversial research Paul claims could have contributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Paul grilled Fauci about an NIH funded study that he says qualifies as gain-of-function research, the process of altering a pathogen to make it more transmissible in order to better predict emerging diseases. Paul asked Fauci if he would like to retract that statement from the May 11 testimony, "Fauci, as you are aware it is a crime to lie to Congress."

`/u/Scoutster13` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oo3yuw/if_anybody_is_lying_here_senator_it_is_you_fauci/):

> Fauci must feel like his entire world is surreal at this point.

## Texas Senate Bill Drops Teaching Requirement That Ku Klux Klan Is 'Morally Wrong'

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-senate-education-bill-white-supremacy_n_60f50cf6e4b01f11895b2dc3):

> In a new political low in Texas, the Republican-dominated state Senate has passed a bill to eliminate a requirement that public schools teach that the Ku Klux Klan and its white supremacist campaign of terror are "Morally wrong." Senate Bill 3 - passed last Friday 18-4 - drops most mentions of people of color and women from the state's required curriculum. Though the new bill essentially erases the cautionary lessons to be learned from the Ku Klux Klan, Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the legislation for rejecting "Philosophies that espouse that one race or sex is better than another."
