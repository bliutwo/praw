Summary of [original article](https://www.theroot.com/maga-marchers-and-proud-boys-descend-on-d-c-setting-f-1845872730):

> Roaming bands of white supremacists trawled the streets of Washington D.C. on Saturday, setting fires to Black Lives Matter banners and getting into stabbing fights in what appeared to be a free-for all outpouring of racist rage. "Last night demonstrators who were part of the MAGA gatherings tore down our Black Lives Matter sign and literally burned it in the street," said the Rev. Ianther M. Mills of Asbury Methodist Church, one of the institutions whose sign was taken by the marauding MAGAs. The violence escalated after an evening of faceoffs with counterprotesters that took place near Harry's, Black Lives Matter Plaza, Franklin Square, and other spots around downtown.
