> I want to thank Donald Trump for getting me so interested in politics. Before he began running, I was a casual observer. I was a registered Democrat, I voted, but didnt really pay attention.
> 
> Now? I not only know what the GSA is, I know the dates every state certifies their election, when the electoral college votes, how the electoral college works, why we should get rid of it, who Vladimir Putin is and why he’s a bad guy, what the senate and House of Representatives do, the entirety of the Watergate scandal, why it’s really dumb that Republicans calls themselves the party of Lincoln, why Mitch McConnell is the biggest douche in the universe, how easily fascism can rise and why we should fear it, and tons of other things.

> From the article: Former CIA Director and vocal Trump critic John Brennan on Monday took to Twitter to announce that he now plans “to ignore Trump,” and will “leave his fate to our judicial system, his infamy to history, & his legacy to a trash heap.”
> 
> “For four years, I spoke out vigorously against Donald Trump’s craven dishonesty, corrupt pursuit of personal interests, & trampling of our democratic principles,” Brennan, who served under the Obama administration, began in a series of tweets. “After serving over three decades in national security, I felt compelled to condemn Trump’s depravity & incompetence.”
> 
> “My outspokenness has brought criticism, retaliation by the Trump Administration, & threats by those blinded by Trump’s demagoguery,” he continued. “Yes, it is unusual for a former CIA Director to speak out, but when an autocrat descended upon the White House, silence was not an option for me.”
