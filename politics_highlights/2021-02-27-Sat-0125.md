## Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Condemns NYPD Test Deployment of K-9 Robot in Bronx Home | "Please ask yourself: when was the last time you saw next-generation, world class technology for education, healthcare, housing, etc. consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?"

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/02/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-condemns-nypd-test-deployment-k-9-robot-bronx-home):

> In 2016, Dallas police rigged a police bomb disposal robot with explosives to blow up a sniper who killed five officers. Boston Dynamics' robot dog is now armed-in the name of art. "The next time you're at a protest and are relieved to see a robot rather than a baton-wielding officer, know that that robot may be using the IP address of your phone to identify your participation," he wrote.

## Noting 'Most Americans Do Not Give a Sh*t' What Parliamentarian Says, Campaigners Urge Biden-Harris to Fight for $15

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/02/26/noting-most-americans-do-not-give-sht-what-parliamentarian-says-campaigners-urge):

> "We need the Biden administration and Senate Democrats to do everything in their power-overrule the parliamentarian, fire them, abolish the filibuster-to ensure that no less than a $15 minimum wage becomes the law of the land." -Evan Weber, Sunrise Movement. Late Thursday, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough sided with Republican senators who argued that a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 runs afoul of the Byrd Rule and should be removed from the pending $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package-despite recent government analyses showing that the pay raise would have a substantial impact on federal spending and revenue. Should Harris decide to disregard the parliamentarian in an effort to keep the $15 minimum wage provision in the relief package, 60 votes in the Senate would be required to override the vice president.

`/u/ClvrNickname` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lt7l4z/noting_most_americans_do_not_give_a_sht_what/):

> Republicans will move heaven and earth to cut taxes for the wealthy, Democrats will hesitate and wring their hands about exerting even the smallest bit of their power to pass a law that is wildly popular with the public.

> 
> There are plenty of important issues but we won’t move the needle on any of them if we can’t ensure our elections work fairly.

## Ted Cruz jokes about Cancun trip at CPAC as over a million Texans still lack drinkable water

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/969144/ted-cruz-jokes-about-cancun-trip-cpac-over-million-texans-still-lack-drinkable-water):

> Cruz was alluding to the trip he took to Cancun last week in the midst of a massive snowstorm plaguing Texas. Cruz's trip lasted just 11 hours, but the storm - which resulted in a yet-unknown number of deaths and widespread power outages - is still impacting Texans, making his CPAC icebreaker all the more unfunny. As of Wednesday, more than a million Texans still lacked drinkable water in their homes, with 1.2 million people facing "Water disruptions," The Texas Tribune reports.

`/u/HallucinogenicFish` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lt3bda/ted_cruz_jokes_about_cancun_trip_at_cpac_as_over/):

> Joking about his trip, when at least 20 of his constituents died (including an 11-year-old boy) and so many are still suffering. 
> 
> Attacking AOC after she raised $5 million to help his constituents in their terrible suffering, and traveled to Texas to help in person. 
> 
> Downplaying the coronavirus and masking recommendations, after 500,000 Americans (including more than 30,000 Floridians and more than 40,000 Texans) have died in large part due to his party doing exactly those things. 
> 
> Ted Cruz is showing everyone exactly who he is.
