## Lincoln Project says it will sue Rudy Giuliani over Capitol riot claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lincoln-project-rudy-giuliani-sue-capitol-riots-b1795215.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1612036256):

> In an appearance on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast on Friday, Mr Giuliani accused the anti-Trump former Republican of being playing a role in the organisation of the storming of the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. Speaking on Saturday morning, Mr Schmidt said: "Well, what's amazing about it, Ali is that at the end of it when you cut it off when Bannon goes to, 'you're killing me, you're killing me,' because Steve Bannon knows he's going to get sued by us also, and he is, and so is Donald Trump who is Rudy Giuliani's client, and Rudy Giuliani is acting on his behest." Mr Giuliani has made many wild claims regarding the presidential election, Joe Biden's family, and the storming of the Capitol.

## Biden Is The First President To Openly Oppose The Death Penalty. He Can Help End It

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-oppose-death-penalty-how-he-can-end-it_n_6014a4c0c5b6bde2f5bf83e0):

> Biden is the first U.S. president to publicly oppose the death penalty, despite having risen through national politics by championing policies that expanded the use of capital punishment. Death penalty opponents are calling on Biden to announce an immediate pause on federal executions and death sentences - and to commute the sentences of those who are already on death row, as a failsafe against Congress failing to act. As Democrats in Congress work to whip up votes for death penalty abolition, the Biden administration could create a national commission on the death penalty and provide funding for states to do their own in-depth studies.

## Stop Trying to Make This About "Unity" -- There's No Uniting With Fascists

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/stop-trying-to-make-this-about-unity-theres-no-uniting-with-fascists/):

> You see, three weeks and apparently ten million years ago - when Congresspeople like McCarthy were running for their lives in a Capitol building under violent siege by Trump voters, remember? - the minority leader summoned the will to blame Donald Trump for his outsized role in inciting the mob. Trump, sensing slippage in his stranglehold over the GOP, responded immediately with threats to split the GOP by starting his own party, the Patriot Party. A frontal assault on the very home of American democracy by Republican Trump supporters? It's time to stop living in the past.

## Biden team scrambles to find 20m vaccine doses Trump reportedly failed to track

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/30/us-covid-vaccine-doses-biden-trump):

> The Biden administration has spent its first week in office attempting to manually track down 20m vaccine doses in the pipeline between federal distribution and administration at clinic sites, when a dose finally reaches a patient's arm. As of Saturday, 49 million doses of vaccine have been distributed by the federal government, but only 27 million administered by states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A state health department official told lawmakers there was not enough vaccine to meet demand, but also that 50% of the doses had been set aside for a pharmacy partnership to vaccinate staff and residents of long-term care homes.
