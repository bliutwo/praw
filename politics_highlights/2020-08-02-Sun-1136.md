## It's time to start handing out fines to people who refuse to wear masks

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/fines-needed-people-dont-wear-masks-covid-19-coronavirus-2020-7):

> Businesses must require staff and patrons to wear masks or risk having their license suspended, and individuals, with limited exceptions, must wear masks in public or risk a $500 fine. A recent study shows that 45,000 deaths could be avoided by November if 95% of people wore masks in public. These workers have had to endure an uptick in this kind of violence from a swath of people who refuse to wear a mask on a philosophical hill they're willing to let everyone die on.

> 30 years to figure out that republicans use bigotry as a corner stone ? I'm calling bullshit what it is is that you and other republicans have Trump guilt and that because he's moved the republicans from a soft bigotry to blatant bigotry .

## ‘Hating Joe Biden doesn’t juice up their base’: Key swing state slips away from Trump. Trump has trailed in every public poll in Pennsylvania since June.

`/u/ChipmunkNamMoi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2bkwd/hating_joe_biden_doesnt_juice_up_their_base_key/):

> As a Pennsylvanian I'll be shocked if Trump wins this state.
> 
> He keeps acting like the suburbs are full of lily white housewives. Couldn't be further from the truth. I've noticed a trend of the suburbs becoming more liberal, or at least more vocally liberal, pro education, and racially diverse. He lost them in 2018 and he sure as hell isn't getting them back this year.
> 
> He'll still have the hicks in Pennsyltucky, but they won't be enough to carry him if the suburbs swing hard against him, which it looks like many are doing. 
> 
> Biden is also from Scranton and his wife is from the Philly suburbs. If there's one thing we like, it's locals. I don't think that's enough to garauntee a win by any means, but it won't hurt either.

## How the Trump campaign came to court QAnon, the online conspiracy movement identified by the FBI as a violent threat

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-trump-campaign-came-to-court-qanon-the-online-conspiracy-movement-identified-by-the-fbi-as-a-violent-threat/2020/08/01/dd0ea9b4-d1d4-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html):

> Outside the Las Vegas Convention Center, Kayleigh McEnany raised a microphone to a mega-fan and asked what it felt like to be acknowledged by President Trump at his February rally in Sin City.At the time a spokeswoman for Trump's reelection campaign, McEnany nodded as the supporter said the shout-out was most meaningful because of the words on the shirt he was wearing, which he read aloud: "Where we go one, we go all," the motto of QAnon conspiracy theorists who believe Trump is battling a cabal of deep-state saboteurs who worship Satan and traffic children for sex. Americans may be oblivious to QAnon but still shaped by its doctrine, Zuckerman said, arguing, "It's actually more dangerous if people don't know what Q is but hold these beliefs." Because of the overlap between QAnon communities and far-right circles, he said, aspects of the conspiracy theory are filtering up to conservative websites, as well as to the pro-Trump One America News and Fox News.The coronavirus pandemic, by bringing into sharp focus anti-scientific beliefs among a broad segment of the president's supporters, offers a preview of the clashing worldviews that QAnon could portend, Zuckerman added. The inclusion of QAnon symbols in official campaign media, previously unreported, sent shock waves through the QAnon community, whose primary aim is to be noticed by Trump.

> Trump’s coalition of support at this point is:  White nationalists, conspiracy theorists, nihilist rich people, brainwashed Fox watchers, and evangelicals. There is lots of overlap.  
> 
> Awesome tent they have going there.

> Problem was we didn't mobilize and go all out in March/April because Administration didn't use the time they had to prepare in February.   Everything was half-assed while the virus hangs around waiting to pounce.  Now were are in a deep crises and instead of taking a Golden opportunity to unite us as a nation (think post 9/11), Trump did everything to divide us, including by attacking the science needed to keep us safe.  
> I'm done ranting now, worst President EVER.

## The moment impeachment managers realized how corrupt Trump’s defense was

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-impeachment-senate-trial/2020/07/31/7a01e764-d29c-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html):

> That was the moment I realized how dangerously deep the Trump rot went: The president's lawyers could have defended him capably without stooping to this. The Trump adminstration had thrown every defense imaginable at subpoenas of evidence of the president's misconduct. The Judiciary Committee had actually granted Trump the same fundamental protections that Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had earlier: the ability to call witnesses, to submit or seek documents, to have counsel present in our committee, and on and on.

`/u/SadisticPottedPlant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2aha0/the_moment_impeachment_managers_realized_how/):

> >Like so many others, most notably the once-reputable Attorney General William P. Barr, they had been drawn into Trump’s vortex of deceit.
> 
> Stop trying to convince me Barr was a paragon of virtue before he started working for Trump. He did the dirty work for republicans long ago and THAT is why he was brought bad to protect their latest criminal piece of shit in the WH.
