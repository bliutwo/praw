> Why do Republican Senators have doubts about election results in democratic leaning counties and not throughout the state in general? Isn’t this suspicious behavior on their part? What are their doubts really?

## Republicans block proposal to let voters standing in line receive water at the polls

`/u/The_Lonely_Satirist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/na423x/republicans_block_proposal_to_let_voters_standing/):

> Stop taking attention away from the other parts of the bill that are even more troubling.
> 
> In Georgia this bill creates an election board appointed by a Republican legislative majority to oversee all counties in future elections.
> 
> The state board, which now will be fully controlled by the Republican legislative majority, is unilaterally empowered to take over (among other things) the process of disqualifying ballots across the state. Given that Georgia Republicans have helped promote false allegations of voter fraud, it’s easy to see why handing them so much power over local election authorities is so worrying.
> 
> This board now also has the unchecked power to suspend county election officials, and removes the secretary of state as a voting member from said board. Raffensperger proved to be a difficult obstacle for Trump.
> 
> From 2012 to 2018, Georgia shuttered more than 214 voting precincts around the state, Those changes, confused many voters, who upon showing up to the wrong precinct had to vote with provisional ballots.
> 
> This provision removes even that remedy for voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m., requiring them to instead travel to the correct precinct or risk being disenfranchised.
> 
> Casting a provisional ballot after showing up at the wrong precinct was by far the most common reason for voting provisionally in the 2020 election in Georgia
> 
> Of the [11,120 provisional ballots](https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/105369/web.264614/#/detail/5000) in the 2020 presidential election, Biden won 64 percent and Trump took 34 percent.
> 
> Among the major changes, the law clearly reduces the time for absentee voting: The state used to allow voters to request an absentee ballot up to 180 days before an election; the [new law](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201121) cuts that to 78 days and no later than 11 days before an election. It prohibits officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters unless the voter specifically requested one.
> 
> the new law gives specific requirements on early voting times, while the old law gave county elections officials more leeway to make these decisions. In fact, while the law now mandates two Saturdays instead of one, it also says counties and municipalities can’t hold early voting on any days besides those outlined in the law.
> 
> You've probably heard Republican figureheads use the phrase "we're actually making it EASIER to vote, we've expanded early voting". Which is disingenuous becuase:
> 
> Early voting is expanded in smaller (rural republican) counties, but not in larger (democrat) ones:
> 
> The provision requires counties to hold early voting during weekday working hours — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.. And sometimes, depending on the county, may be extended a couple hours. Previously, the law called only for early voting during “normal business hours” and left it up to counties to determine those hours.
> 
> The provision also adds a second required Saturday of early voting, which will increase access to early voting in most of the state’s rural counties, where election administrators have often been short-staffed and have offered fewer hours of early voting. Most larger counties in the state already offered multiple weekend days of early voting. So they've made it easier for republicans to vote, not democrats, while it also may become more difficult for some democrats to vote in red counties;
> 
> The law doesn’t require the availability of early voting on Sundays, and counties can choose whether to open for early voting on up to two Sundays before an election. Counties that choose not to open on Sundays would be limiting ballot access for parishioners at Black churches that have [often organized parishioners to vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/churches-black-voters-georgia.html) after Sunday services.
> 
> The bill also allows any individual Georgian citizen to file an unlimited number of challenges to the eligibility of particular voters, effectively increasing the number of opportunities for newly centralized election authorities to exercise their powers to disqualify Democrats
> 
> The bill Imposes new limitations on ballot drop boxes that effectively ban their widespread deployment outside of a governor-declared emergency. This is another big one, effectively limiting the number of ways people can vote, and along with the closing down of polling places in blue regions, it's painfully obvious what the goal is here.
> 
> It creates a fraud hotline that allows people to anonymously complain about allegedly fraudulent behavior at the polls, and with an eye toward voter fraud, the state attorney general will manage this election hotline.
> 
> It’s also now illegal for election officials to mail out absentee ballot applications to all voters.
> 
> And yes, criminalizing giving out water and snacks is bad
> 
> in 2020, many voters had to wait in hours-long lines to vote, especially in heavily Black areas. This is a real and long-running problem: One study ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/study-heavily-minority-precincts-endured-longer-wait-times-to-cast-ballots-in-2018/2019/11/04/f8433e1c-fef7-11e9-8501-2a7123a38c58\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/study-heavily-minority-precincts-endured-longer-wait-times-to-cast-ballots-in-2018/2019/11/04/f8433e1c-fef7-11e9-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html)) of the 2018 elections found that, nationwide, voters in low-income and minority communities had to wait in longer lines than voters in wealthier and whiter areas. The longest lines in the country, according the study, were in Fulton County.
> 
> As Georgia’s population has grown in the past few years, particularly in Democratic-leaning areas, the Republicans who control state elections have cut the number of polling places statewide by 10 percent. And now it’s illegal for people to bring food and water to help the voters who wait in these artificially long lines.
> 
> And there's also the adding of more ID requirements, particularly for mail in voting. Hmm, I wonder who that's targeting? Look, I don't have a direct problem with voter ID itself, I have a problem with it's lack of ease of access, and having to navigate through the obstacles required to obtain it, particularly for the poor. All voter ID should be free and should exist concurrently with automatic voter registration for all American citizens. It should be easily obtainable from a variety of institutions. Not just through long lines at the DMV. You should be able to receive Voter ID through applying for things like SNAP benefits, Medicaid/Medicare, and other assistance programs. Just like they're used to help people register to vote in the first place.  Hell, we should be sending all those that are automatically registered a temporary voter ID to use in the next election cycle.
> 
> And a fair share of Republicans are justifying these voting restrictions with the idea that they're "preventing democrats from cheating", that these laws are to protect "election integrity", when we all know that this is just a way for Republicans to find an objectively illegitimate reason, and to use duplicitous terms like "election integrity" to make it harder for democrats to vote, while simultaneously pandering to a base of conspiratorial fucking nutjobs. They're exploiting the baseless conspiracy theories and lies purported by Trump, and more specifically the idiots who believe those lies, to justify passing sweeping voting restrictions while they garner support and blind admiration from conservatives.
> 
> This is also about Republicans losing a precious southern state. They're going to do everything within their power to prevent this blue trend from continuing. Is saying that these laws are Jim Crow 2.0 a bit of an hyperbole? Sure... But Georgia is among many southern states that have counties with some of the largest and often majority black populations. However, Georgia was the only one of these type of states to turn blue. So it's undoubtedly clear who these laws are targeted against. With this law in place, it's looking significantly more likely that Georgia will turn back red in the next election. Meaning Republicans will get what they wanted out of this oppressive "prevent democrats from ~~cheating~~ ***voting***" bill.

## Report: Matt Gaetz’s Intern Ex-Girlfriend May Soon Be Cooperating With the Feds

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/matt-gaetz-intern-girlfriend):

> The ex-girlfriend is believed to "Have knowledge of drug use and arrangements with women," sources told CNN. The Bahamas trip has become a focus of investigators, who are scrutinizing whether women were paid to travel for sex with Gaetz and others, and whether the trip was part of an effort to illegally influence Gaetz in the area of medical marijuana, CNN has previously reported. The former girlfriend was also involved in some of the financial transactions that the FBI has obtained, and investigators are pursuing what knowledge Gaetz had about the payments and activities, sources say. The cooperation of Greenberg and the former girlfriend could be among the final steps in the probe of Gaetz.

## Ted Cruz walks out of gun violence hearing after failing to change the subject

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/982157/ted-cruz-walks-gun-violence-hearing-after-failing-change-subject):

> During a Senate Judiciary Committee on "Ghost guns" on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz tried to change the subject to a debate about police funding. "If you don't support abolishing the police, why do you keep voting for nominees who advocate abolishing the police?," Cruz asked his Democratic colleagues, referring to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, whom President Biden has nominated to run the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. "As you well know, Senator Cruz, that is a complete distortion of their positions" - Sen. Blumenthal.

`/u/DUNG_INSPECTOR` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/na1s9w/ted_cruz_walks_out_of_gun_violence_hearing_after/):

> I wish someone could help me understand why Texans like Ted Cruz, he seems to go against everything I have been told about Texans. I thought Texans like tough guys, not sniveling cowards who kiss the ass of the man who insulted his wife and run away from their duties in the Senate.

## 9 of 9 GOP Senators Agree That Voters Waiting in Line Should Not Be Given Food or Water — "Republicans would rather have you starve than vote," said one critic.

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/05/11/9-9-gop-senators-agree-voters-waiting-line-should-not-be-given-food-or-water):

> All nine Republicans on a U.S. Senate panel-including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell-voted Tuesday against legislation intended to ensure that volunteers and organizations are allowed to hand out food and water to voters stuck in long lines across the country. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who both represent Georgia, introduced the Voters' Access to Water Act in response to a sweeping law enacted by the Peach State's Republican legislators in March that critics condemned as a "Vicious attack on voter rights." Poll workers in the state can set up self-service water receptacles, but volunteers are now banned from passing out food or water. The proposed amendment opposed by the GOP states that "Allowing volunteers to donate food and water to all people waiting in line at a polling place regardless of the voters' political preference and without engaging in electioneering activities or partisan advocacy, helps ensure Americans who face long lines at their polling place can still exercise their Constitutional right to vote, without risk of dehydration, inadequate food, discomfort, and risks to health."

`/u/Crestina` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nabj5c/9_of_9_gop_senators_agree_that_voters_waiting_in/):

> How can a country that calls itself free, outlaw giving water to someone?

## No one likes Caitlyn Jenner according to “bleak” new poll — Caitlyn Jenner has managed to disappoint the right, the left, and LGBTQ people in her short campaign. Almost no one supports her.

Summary of [original article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/05/no-one-likes-caitlyn-jenner-according-bleak-new-poll/):

> A shockingly low 6% of California voters said that they would consider voting for Caitlyn Jenner against Gov. Gavin Newsom in the state's upcoming recall election, according to a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies/LA Times poll. Former Rep. Doug Ose got support from 14% of voters in the poll for his campaign. In his first poll at the time - a Field Poll three months before the election - Schwarzenegger got 30% support.

`/u/FusterCluck4` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nabgr7/no_one_likes_caitlyn_jenner_according_to_bleak/):

> The entire thing was a publicity stunt to satisfy her narcissism anyway.
