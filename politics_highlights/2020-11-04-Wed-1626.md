## 'Stop the count': Crowd tries to storm Detroit convention centre

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/crowd-storm-detroit-vote-count-election-2020-b1598248.html):

> A group of "Stop the count" protestors tried to storm their way into a Detroit convention centre where ballots are being processed, NBC News reports, with guards asking the crowd to get back and pizza boxes covering the window to obstruct view of the counting inside. In another video posted shortly afterwards, protestors can be seen banging on windows outside the convention centre. The president recently sued Michigan to stop vote counting there, and has made continued false claims about voter fraud and the integrity of the election.

## NBC News: Biden is projected winner in Michigan

Summary of [original article](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1246402):

> With 86 percent of the vote in, Biden leads Trump with 51 percent of the vote compared to Trump's 47.6 percent. With 86 percent of the vote in, Biden has 49.3 percent of the vote over Trump's 48.7 percent. Trump's campaign is also hopeful about North Carolina and the state's 15 electoral votes, but the race is still too close to call with 95 percent of the vote in.

## Greensboro USPS only delivers 73% of mail-in ballots on-time despite court order

Summary of [original article](https://www.wnct.com/your-local-election-headquarters/greensboro-usps-only-delivers-73-of-mail-in-ballots-on-time-despite-court-order/):

> GREENSBORO, N.C. - The U.S. Postal Service was ordered to find and deliver all undelivered mail-in ballots in Greensboro, the local USPS admitted in court filings that their processing rate was 72.92%. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, of Washington, D.C., told the postal service that the agency had to search for any mail-in ballots still waiting to be delivered at 27 facilities across several battleground states. New data shows that the postal service was only able to process ballots at a rate of 72.92% in Greensboro on Election Day. The postal service reported that cities in other battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, had also processed ballots at a rate less than 80%..

## Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor says Trump 'no different than any other random internet troll'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/524508-pennsylvanias-lieutenant-governor-says-trump-no-different-than-any-other):

> Pennsylvania Lieutenant Gov. said on Wednesday that is "No different than any other random internet troll" after the president said on Twitter that his former leads in key battleground states are diminishing because of "Surprise ballot dumps," apparently referring to the counting of mail-in ballots. "The president is no different than any other random internet troll saying crazy things that have no basis in reality," Fetterman said in an interview on MSNBC. "And Twitter constantly puts those kind of statements on hold, and none of those are any factual basis." Trump tweeted earlier that he was leading in many battleground states but that his leads "Started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted."

## Federal judge says he'll force USPS postmaster DeJoy to show up in court and explain what happened to mail-in voting

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-sullivan-usps-louis-dejoy-mail-voting-problems-2020-11):

> A federal judge on Wednesday said he would force Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to testify in court about how the US Postal Service handled the election, saying he'd depose him if necessary. He asked Kevin Bray, the USPS official overseeing mail voting for this year's election, to appear in court on Wednesday afternoon. They sought rulings from Sullivan, a federal district judge in Washington, DC, to ensure that the USPS handled mail-in ballots so that every vote cast by mail would arrive at ballot-processing locations before states' deadlines.

`/u/DirtySingh` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jo2cao/federal_judge_says_hell_force_usps_postmaster/):

> And the judge will drag it out until after the next president is sworn in... so there won't be any pardons or DOJ stepping in. In fact, DeJoy will probably flip on trump.
