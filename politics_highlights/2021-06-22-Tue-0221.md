## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 25

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o4ytiq/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Texas. Permitless carry law signed, Abbott announces $250M funding for border wall, and says that the Texas power grid is in tiptop shape. Yet Texans were asked to cut back on power usage because the grid is being overloaded by temperatures that didn't even hit 100.

## Manchin just got Republicans to admit their ‘election fraud’ concerns are nonsense

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/21/manchin-just-got-republicans-admit-their-election-fraud-concerns-are-nonsense/):

> Credit where due to Sen. Joe Manchin III: The media seems to have missed it, but last week he got Republicans to admit to the "Big lie." Whatever his Democratic colleagues' other beefs with him, they should celebrate this achievement. By ceding ground on "Election security" and effectively taking the issue off the table, Manchin just proved Republicans never actually cared about election security. Another way to interpret last week's events is that Manchin slyly revealed Republicans' stated concerns about stolen elections - and their professed desire to work across the aisle - as the baloney they always were.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/california-pay-off-all-past-due-rent-accrued-during-covid-giving-renters-clean-slate-1602556?amp=1&__twitter_impression=true):

> California is paying off residents' past due rent that was accrued during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving renters a clean slate, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced recently. The state's $5.2 billion in funds from Congressionally-approved aid packages is enough to pay off overdue rent, according to Newsom's senior counselor on housing and homelessness, Jason Elliott, the Associated Press reported. Newsom says California will pay off all past-due rent accumulated in the nation's most populated state because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, promising to make landlords whole.

## 21 attorneys general oppose USPS plan to delay first-class mail, warning 4 to 5-day delivery times could have 'significant' impact on mail-in ballots

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/21-attorneys-general-oppose-usps-plan-delay-first-class-mail-2021-6):

> Delaying first-class mail delivery by as many as two days would harm rural communities and potentially disenfranchise those who cast absentee ballots, 21 state attorneys general argued in a joint statement issued Monday. In March, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, unveiled a plan to raise prices and slash services at the US Postal Service, citing a need to address a revenue shortfall, The Washington Post reported. Signatories, all Democrats - including city attorneys for San Francisco and New York - maintain that delaying mail delivery would violate USPS's statutory duty to provide "Regular and effective" access to postal services for rural communities.

`/u/Grannywine` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o58ivd/21_attorneys_general_oppose_usps_plan_to_delay/):

> Louis DeJoy has zero business running USPS, he is already under investigation by the FBI, he needs to be removed sooner not later.

## Psaki says stepping up IRS enforcement would 'raise a great deal more' to pay for infrastructure than a gas tax increase

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-irs-enforcement-congress-gas-tax-psaki-infrastructure-2021-6):

> White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed back against a gas tax proposal under consideration in the Senate, as she argued that ramping up IRS enforcement would net more revenue. At a Monday press conference, Psaki said the administration had projected that the bipartisan group's planned gas tax measure would raise around $40 billion in revenue. She said additional tax enforcement "Would raise a great deal more, by multiples of what the gas tax would raise," while she also noted "It would fall on predominantly wealthy Americans and just ensure they're paying the taxes they owe."

> She is not wrong here. In fact if all our government agencies  stopped not collecting the fines they have leveled against businesses, which they do all the time, we might not have needed a payroll tax to begin with.

## FBI agent acknowledges in court filing that Trump backers discussed 'revolution' before Jan. 6

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/fbi-agent-acknowledges-court-filing-trump-backers-discussed-revolution-jan-n1271305):

> WASHINGTON - The FBI director and other senior officials have consistently downplayed the intelligence value of social media posts by Trump supporters prior to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, suggesting the bureau had no "Actionable" warning that the Capitol would be targeted by a mob. According to a document entered into court records last week, an FBI agent acknowledged in a February investigative report that angry Trump supporters were talking openly in the days before the riot about bringing guns to the Capitol to start a "Revolution." Officials who have seen them say they were broad and generic and did not lead anyone to believe the Capitol could be a target Jan. 6.The FBI director said that most of what the FBI has learned about the attack on the Capitol, it learned through the massive investigation it has conducted in the aftermath, an investigation that so far has resulted in charges against nearly 500 people.

> Again, the parallels between Trump and Hitler essentially cannot be overstated.  Hitler told everyone what his plans were for years.  He told everyone what he was and what he planned because he was a malignant narcissist who truly believed that history would judge him as the savior of all mankind.  He riled up the feverent reactionary masses (to the tune of 20-30% of the population) which just so happens to equal the rough percentages of hardcore Authoritarian Followers in almost any significant sample size of humans.  He said in no uncertain terms, over and over, what he planned for Germany.
> 
> He only commanded a small percentage of the electorate, but they were vocal.  The mainstream conservative party privately thought Hitler was a clown, but also coveted his supporters, and so they gave him a place at the table, each of them believing that the energy of his followers could be manipulated and pointed in whatever direction he wanted.  They believed that Hitler himself could be controlled, negotiated with, that he was just being performative to gain the support of his followers and that if he got into power, he would pivot to more mainstream positions.
> 
> And so he was given legitimacy, eeked his way into power, and over the next decade proceeded to do ... everything he said he would from the start, eventually dismantling any semblance of democracy, establishing himself as dictator, and starting a devastating World War.
> 
> When Trump and his supporters talk about a "revolution", they mean exactly what they say.  They have zero belief in democracy, and their greatest wish is to install Trump as emperor of the United States.  These are dangerous people.

## Watchdog sues FEC for closing Trump investigation

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/559474-exclusive-watchdog-sues-fec-for-closing-trump-investigation):

> In a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Democratic group End Citizens United, Campaign Legal Center Action challenged the decision by Republican FEC commissioners to close an investigation into the Trump campaign without providing their reasoning. CLC Action wants a federal court to order the FEC to determine whether the Trump campaign violated campaign finance law. The lawsuit coincides with a strategy by Democratic FEC commissioners to block the FEC from defending itself in court.

> The Republican Party is a criminal enterprise.
