## Congress is about to bar unidentified federal agents from policing protests.

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/12/trump-barr-congress-federal-agencies-policing-protests-identification/):

> Congress is set to approve a defense policy bill that bars unidentified federal law enforcement officers from policing protests. The bill responds to a phenomenon that Mother Jones flagged in June: Unidentified federal law enforcement officers with no identifying insignia joined in the Trump administration's coordinated crackdown on protests against police violence in several cities earlier this summer. In July, the Trump administration deployed more unidentified agents as part of a large federal response to protests around a federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon.

> Funny, r/conservative isn’t going crazy over Trump asking for a list of republicans supporting Biden as the winner yet they went nuts over AOC saying we need to keep a list of Trump supporters in key government positions to remind us of who they really are when they delete their tweets.

## Jill Biden To Push For Debt-Free Community College As First Lady

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jill-biden-debt-free-community-college-first-lady_n_5fcbb575c5b6787f2a985511):

> Biden has also spent much of her career teaching at the community college level, and has been an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College since 2009. In a 2015 speech before the Community College National Legislative Summit, Biden traced her passion for education to her grandmother, who "Taught at an old-fashioned, one-room schoolhouse." Biden recalled how she kept her grandmother's school bell as a treasured heirloom and described the impact she felt from working with students to improve their reading skills. During her time as second lady, Biden also worked with former first lady Michelle Obama to launch Joining Forces, an initiative that urged Americans to "To rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities." As first lady, Biden plans to relaunch Joining Forces.

`/u/OnlyLoveCanBreak` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k7b84u/jill_biden_to_push_for_debtfree_community_college/):

> Community college rules. I spent like $2000 total on my two years of general education 101 classes, then transferred and finished a bachelor’s degree at a four year school. In the business world as long as you have the degree, no one gives a shit where you did your first two years. 
> 
> I also got a scholarship for transferring in with good grades. I ended up with “only” around $25,000 in debt, which is still absurd college costs that much but I was able to pay everything off without too much pain.

> The Trump campaign and the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, put Carone forward, presented her as a credible witness and asked state legislators to disenfranchise millions of Michigan voters and declare Trump the winner of Michigan's electoral votes based in large part on Carone's claims. HuffPost asked the attorney whether the public should take any of her voter fraud claims seriously given what he knows about Carone. Barron, the attorney for Stackpoole's ex-wife, said that he recalled that Carone "Testified that my client had sent these videos out or had hacked phone" and was "Adamant that she was appalled that these videos had gotten out."
