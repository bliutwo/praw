## Russiagate Was Not a Hoax | The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence confirmed what the Mueller report could not.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/russiagate-wasnt-a-hoax/615373/):

> Throughout their filings, Mueller's team referred to Manafort's Kyiv-based aide-de-camp, Konstantin Kilimnik, as an active Russian agent. Manafort had clearly spoken with Kilimnik during the campaign, and had even passed confidential campaign information to him, with the understanding that the documents would ultimately arrive in the hands of oligarchs close to the Kremlin. Kilimnik kept in close contact with the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a former client of Manafort's.

> The report proves that Trump's team got the heads up about the Hollywood Access tape an hour before and then Roger Stone went and told Wikileaks to dump the Podesta emails and it shows that Wikileaks was working in coordination with Russia.
> 
> That sounds like collusion to me.

> Guess what in 2016 it was all true. Russia and Trump colluded to win the election. Trumps campaign manager gave all of their internal polling data to Russia. Trump told wiki leaks to dumb the democratic emails when the access Hollywood tape came out. Anyone involved in getting a foreign government to interfere with our presidential election should be put in jail for life. Anyone who covered it up and lied should be put in jail for a long time.

> Embarrassed is just one of many negative emotions. How about rage at the stupidity? Fear for the future? Unfathomable sadness at the loss of life?

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/revealed-donald-trump-letters-to-vladimir-putin-miss-universe-russia-2020-8):

> Years before becoming president, Donald Trump told Russian President Vladimir Putin that "I'm a big fan of yours" and pleaded with him to be guest of honor at a Miss Universe pageant. A second letter dated from 2013 involves Trump trying to persuade Putin to attend the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, an event run and owned by Trump. On June 18, 2013, Trump had tweeted: "Do you think Putin will be going to the Miss Universe pageant in November in Moscow? If so, will he become my new best friend?".

> The post master backed off. The post office, that DeJoy was brought in to dismantle, didn't support the actions he was taking. DeJoy was brought in as a corporate raider to dismantle a functioning system for the political benefit of Trump.
