Summary of [original article](https://www.cbs46.com/news/bidens-lead-in-georgia-grows-to-over-14-000-votes/article_9a4fc26a-2423-11eb-a2da-cbaed3fb589d.html):

> Any lingering doubts about whether President Donald Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden won the state of Georgia seem to be evaporating with each report from the Secretary of State's office. As of Wednesday morning, former Vice President Biden holds a 14,101 vote lead in Georgia, larger than his lead in other states like Arizona. Still, even if a hand recount is ordered, Biden's lead is not expected to shrink by enough votes to change the outcome of the former vice president winning Georgia's 16 Electoral College votes.

What the experts appointed to the Biden-Harris Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board say about the incoming administration's approach to the pandemic. Experts told Newsweek on Monday that while it would not be appropriate for Biden to appoint Fauci to his COVID advisory board while he is still a member of the current administration's task force, he would likely help with the transition process.
