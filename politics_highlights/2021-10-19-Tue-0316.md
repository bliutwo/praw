## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 42

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qapqhe/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> I live in the Qutopia of West Virginia. This week our 99 9% republican state legislature has released a new congressional map. The new map creates North/ South congressional districts.
> 
> As one would expect, there was a lot on backroom positioning involved and Rep. Alex Mooney - who has been referred to as a Carpetbagger in local conversation - saw his district dissolved. 
> 
> This development COULD be a great opportunity for the diminished and disorganized state democratic party as the new map places Morgantown and Martinsburg, 2 of the most educated, populous and progressive municipalities in all of WV, in one Northern congressional district. However, it's unlikely that the disjointed democratic party of WV could gather a coalition capable of winning or put forth a candidate with broad enough appeal in the majority rural state.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/psaki-says-trump-incited-insurrection-pressured-doj-propagate-lies-1640073):

> In answering Doocy's question, Psaki stated that the former president had used his office to his personal advantage by citing the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, as well as pressuring DOJ officials to lie about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. "Well, since you give me the opportunity here, former President Trump used his office to incite an insurrection, he put political pressure on senior DOJ officials to propagate lies about the election to the point where they threatened to resign en masse," Psaki replied. Psaki: Since you give me the opportunity here, former President Trump used his office to incite an insurrection, he put political pressure on DOJ officials to propagate lies about the election I think there's hardly a comparison there pic.

> No shit, but the big takeaway here is the official spokesperson for the President is saying this in direct terms.
> 
> You don't just do that unless you've got the means to back it up. Statement is huge for that reason.

## Manchin Sparks Fury With Demands for Work Requirement, $60K Income Cap on Child Tax Credit| "Who besides a cartoon villain would ever think this is a good idea?"

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/10/18/manchin-sparks-fury-demands-work-requirement-60k-income-cap-child-tax-credit):

> Progressives responded with outrage following Sunday night's report that right-wing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has told the White House that he would only support prolonging the expanded child tax credit-a key component of his party's potentially historic investment in improving social welfare-if it includes a work requirement and limits benefits to households with annual incomes under $60,000. Originally expanded in March when President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, the child tax credit has provided millions of families-including those who are out of the workforce and lack taxable income-with monthly checks of up to $300 per child. According to him, denying the child tax credit to families that earn over $60,000 per year-rather than sticking with the existing cap of $150,000-would only cut program costs by roughly 28% because the majority of current beneficiaries are not affluent.

## GOP-led Texas House approves new district maps that favor Republicans even more and strip away seats in Hispanic and Black areas

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/texas-house-approves-redistricting-republican-advantage-2021-10?_ga=2.254932235.265375922.1634524866-1724750532.1634524):

> The Republican-led Texas House approved new district maps on Sunday that give Republicans an even bigger advantage in the state's congressional representation and strips away seats in Hispanic and Black areas, the Austin American-Statesman reported. The new map would add up to two more seats to Republicans' already crushing 23-13 edge. The seats would remove the only majority Black district in the state and reduce the Hispanic-majority districts from two to just one.

## Democrats Should Call Manchin and Sinema’s Bluff, Right Now

Summary of [original article](https://jacobinmag.com/2021/10/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-infrastructure-reconciliation-bill-vote-senate-call-their-bluff):

> More specifically, Sinema and Manchin are betting that concern trolling the bill in the press will prompt party leaders to once again hack away at the legislation before the two senators are ever put on the spot to vote yes or no. A Democratic apologist might counter that, all evidence to the contrary, their beloved party leaders are playing some brilliant game of fifteen-dimensional chess and the reason the bill hasn't been put to a vote yet is because Manchin and Sinema may get their precious feelings hurt and get mad if they are put on the spot. Put simply: Calling their bluff and holding a vote doesn't work if the White House, the party apparatus, and Washington's constellation of liberal advocacy groups aren't all in on a campaign to shame Manchin and Sinema for obstruction, and reward them for support.

`/u/newfrontier58` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qauurp/democrats_should_call_manchin_and_sinemas_bluff/):

> The central argument, if one is not interested in reading the full thing.
> 
> >But if Schumer and Biden and their party actually wants to pass a real reconciliation bill that isn’t gutted (granted, that’s a big “if”), then they should remember that old adage about rigged games: The only winning move is not to play.  
> >  
> >One way to stop playing the game Manchin, Sinema, and their corporate sponsors are playing is to schedule a vote on a bill. And to really up the ante, Democratic leaders could add a bunch of programs that will target aid and investment to West Virginia and Arizona.  
> >  
> >Holding a vote would make this terrible twosome go on record voting against paid family leave, universal pre-K, free community college, and every other wildly popular and desperately needed initiative in the legislation.  
> >  
> >Holding a vote would make Manchin try to explain why he would deny an expansion of dental care to seniors in West Virginia, who are facing a dental health crisis. It would compel him to explain why he takes orders from Exxon lobbyists, and is trying to kill climate initiatives when West Virginia is the most flood-threatened state in America, and only a tiny fraction of its jobs is actually in mining.  
> >  
> >Similarly, holding a vote would make Sinema head back to the desert and explain why she is betraying her own explicit prescription drug promises and killing drug pricing legislation for Arizona seniors, and make her explain why she’s voting down climate legislation when the climate crisis could soon make large regions of her state uninhabitable.  
> >  
> >Hold the damn vote. Now.
