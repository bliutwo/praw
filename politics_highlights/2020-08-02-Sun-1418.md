## It's time to start handing out fines to people who refuse to wear masks

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/fines-needed-people-dont-wear-masks-covid-19-coronavirus-2020-7):

> Businesses must require staff and patrons to wear masks or risk having their license suspended, and individuals, with limited exceptions, must wear masks in public or risk a $500 fine. A recent study shows that 45,000 deaths could be avoided by November if 95% of people wore masks in public. These workers have had to endure an uptick in this kind of violence from a swath of people who refuse to wear a mask on a philosophical hill they're willing to let everyone die on.

## The GOP Is Blocking Journalists From Covering Trump’s Renomination. That’s a First in Modern History.

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/08/the-gop-is-blocking-journalists-from-covering-trumps-renomination-thats-a-first-in-modern-history/):

> While Trump called off the public components of the convention in Florida last month, citing spiking cases of the virus across the country, 336 delegates are scheduled to gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 24 August to formally vote to make Trump the GOP standard-bearer once more. If the GOP decision stands, it will mark the first party nominating convention in modern history to be closed to reporters. In the meantime, there'll be no shortage of press-packed events featuring Trump gorging on free airtime, lavishly flouting safety concerns and sickening his staff, while blaming everyone but himself.

`/u/bridgemender` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2e9yx/the_gop_is_blocking_journalists_from_covering/):

> He doesn't want photographers covering the sparse convention attendance that is going to happen because of coronavirus. If there isn't going to be a raucous crowd, there aren't going to be any pictures.

> 30 years to figure out that republicans use bigotry as a corner stone ? I'm calling bullshit what it is is that you and other republicans have Trump guilt and that because he's moved the republicans from a soft bigotry to blatant bigotry .

## Maryland’s highest court affirms that police can’t use the smell of marijuana to search and arrest a person

> About fucking time.  Now they should go back and expunge anyone convicted where "I smell weed" was the probable cause.
> 
> I remember when I was a teen and had "I smell weed" used on me because I was out late with friends.  Those POS cops tore my vehicle apart, probably did about $1000 worth of damage, and found nothing.  Then, they told me that it wasn't their problem when I wanted them to help me put my vehicle back together.
> 
> Bullshit like that is why I never give cops the benefit of the doubt.

## ‘Hating Joe Biden doesn’t juice up their base’: Key swing state slips away from Trump. Trump has trailed in every public poll in Pennsylvania since June.

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/02/swing-states-slip-from-trump-390164):

> Joe Biden has an overall early lead in the state of 6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average, and has led Trump in all 12 public polls released since the beginning of June. "Hating Joe Biden doesn't juice up their base and their Fox News viewers the way going after Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and AOC do," said Rep. Brendan Boyle, who endorsed Biden the day he launched his 2020 campaign. The pro-Biden American Bridge 21st Century super PAC also countered Trump spots accusing Biden of being soft on China with its own ad charging Trump of the same.

`/u/ChipmunkNamMoi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2bkwd/hating_joe_biden_doesnt_juice_up_their_base_key/):

> As a Pennsylvanian I'll be shocked if Trump wins this state.
> 
> He keeps acting like the suburbs are full of lily white housewives. Couldn't be further from the truth. I've noticed a trend of the suburbs becoming more liberal, or at least more vocally liberal, pro education, and racially diverse. He lost them in 2018 and he sure as hell isn't getting them back this year.
> 
> He'll still have the hicks in Pennsyltucky, but they won't be enough to carry him if the suburbs swing hard against him, which it looks like many are doing. 
> 
> Biden is also from Scranton and his wife is from the Philly suburbs. If there's one thing we like, it's locals. I don't think that's enough to garauntee a win by any means, but it won't hurt either.

## Voting by mail is the safest, easiest way to vote. Why are so many national Republicans lying about it?

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/voting-by-mail-safe-easy-republicans-lying-about-it-2020-8):

> Several red states, including Utah, have robust vote-by-mail systems, he explains, and he points out that the two demographics that have traditionally embraced voting by mail, "Old people and the military, are two very strong Republican voting blocs. This shouldn't be partisan. We should be able to figure this out." Silk says, some states are in the process of establishing safe voting systems right now. Without serious, nonpartisan oversight, it's possible for Republicans to disenfranchise young people and people of color from voting by mail.

`/u/backpackwayne` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2ccm2/voting_by_mail_is_the_safest_easiest_way_to_vote/):

> One of the few times Trump told the truth: *If they had mail-in voting republicans would never win an election again.*

## Morgues Are Overflowing in Mississippi and Coroners Are Terrified

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/amid-a-mississippi-coronavirus-surge-morgues-are-overflowing-and-coroners-are-scared):

> On April 3, as COVID-19 deaths in Mississippi hovered in the low double-digits, the state's chief medical examiner, Mark LeVaughn, fired off a letter to Meredith and the state's 80 other coroners. Over the last few weeks, Mississippi has emerged as something of a worst-case scenario in the country's coronavirus landscape: an already poor, sick, medically under-resourced state where both infections and deaths are rising faster than almost anywhere. The Mississippi Department of Health said in a statement that coroners can request test kits through their county Emergency Management Association, though multiple coroners canvassed by The Daily Beast said the supplies did not always arrive.

`/u/r1chard3` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2ft3f/morgues_are_overflowing_in_mississippi_and/):

> Just like New York in April. If only there had been some national coordination to spend the last three months getting ready.
