> The news media needs to stop calling it a payroll tax "holiday". It isn't a holiday. It is a deferment. Yes. The President has the ability to instruct the IRS to defer tax payments for up to a year but that doesn't mean the bill disappears. It is **deferred**. The President does not have the ability to unilaterally forgive taxes. Only Congress does.
> 
> No business in their right mind would **ever** take that gamble and actually defer those taxes. If they aren't forgiven they will not only be on the hook for their 7.65% they owe but also the 7.65% they failed to withhold from their employees. So the business would owe the IRS 15.3% of their entire operating payroll for six months. Any company would be out of their mind to do that and risk further financial ruin on the promise that it *may* be forgiven at a later date.
> 
> Not to mention that a payroll tax cut is a backdoor method of cutting social security and medicare. So sticking it to the old people...again.

## Trump Just Admitted on Live Television He Will 'Terminate' Social Security and Medicare If Reelected in November

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/08/trump-just-admitted-live-television-he-will-terminate-social-security-and-medicare?cd-origin=rss):

> President Donald Trump on Saturday afternoon openly vowed to permanently "Terminate" the funding mechanism for both Social Security and Medicare if reelected in November-an admission that was seized upon by defenders of the popular safety net programs who have been warning for months that the administration's threat to suspend the payroll tax in the name of economic relief during the Covid-19 pandemic was really a backdoor sabotage effort. "At a time when pensions are vanishing and 401ks have proven inadequate, Trump's plan to eliminate Social Security's revenue stream would destroy the one source of retirement income that people can count on. Moreover, Social Security is often the only disability insurance and life insurance that working families have. If reelected, Trump plans to destroy those benefits as well." On Saturday, Altman called on every lawmaker in Congress to denounce what she called Trump's "Unconstitutional raid on Social Security." In the upcoming election, she said, "Voters should treat any Senator or Representative who is silent as complicit in destroying Social Security. Furthermore, every American who cares about Social Security's future must do everything they can to ensure that Trump does not get a second term."

## Reporter Challenges Trump on Lie About Vets Choice, and He Ends the Press Conference Instead of Answering

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/reporter-challenges-trump-on-lie-about-vets-choice-and-he-ends-the-press-conference-instead-of-answering):

> Speaking at his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, at his second press conference in two days Saturday, President Donald Trump abruptly ended a briefing when a CBS reporter challenged him on a lie he has repeated multiple times. Trump called on White House Correspondent Paula Reid, and she asked, "Why do you keep saying you passed Veterans Choice?" Trump attempted to move on to another reporter, but Reid continued speaking. "It was passed in 2014. But it was a false statement, sir." Trump said earlier in the press conference that he had passed the Veterans Choice Act, which makes it possible for veterans to use their government health benefits at providers other than Veterans Administration hospitals.

In reality, it was passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama. After Trump refused to answer the question multiple times, he cut off the briefing to the cheers of his supporters.

Summary of [original article](https://nypost.com/2020/08/08/kanye-west-booted-off-illinois-ballot-for-invalid-signatures/?utm_campaign=applenews&utm_medium=inline&utm_source=applenews):

> Kanye West won't be appearing on the presidential ballot for his home state after election officials in Illinois found that 1,900 of the 3,128 signatures West submitted are invalid. The signatures were brought to the attention of the Illinois State Board of Elections after three people filed objections citing dodgy signatures, the site reported. Meanwhile Wisconsin is looking into West's presidential bid in that state after Democratic party members found signatures for "Mickey Mouse" and Bernie Sanders on that state's ballot.
