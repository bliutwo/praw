## Donald Trump called voting by mail "refreshingly democratic" in 2000 New York Times op-ed

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/09/15/donald-trump-called-voting-by-mail-refreshingly-democratic-in-2000-new-york-times-op-ed/):

> President Donald Trump, in a 2000 New York Times op-ed, cited the benefits of voting by mail and email as the principal reason why he had briefly run for president as a Reform Party candidate. Dave Shiflett, the co-author of Trump's 2000 campaign book "The America We Deserve" and a member of a Washington-area ghostwriting group, told Salon that while he had not written the New York Times piece, he wrote a Los Angeles Times op-ed on Trump's behalf that same year. The New York Times asked Trump, outside a party for his Miss USA pageant, if he thought it would be difficult to campaign without a significant other.

> This guy has no moral center.

## Bill and Melinda Gates say ‘shocking’ US pandemic response is due to ‘terrible leadership’ | ‘This has been a mismanaged situation every step of the way’

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437585/bill-melinda-gates-slam-us-pandemic-response-goalkeepers-2020-report-vaccination):

> America's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been "Shocking" and "Unbelievable," with matters made much worse by "Terrible leadership," said Bill and Melinda Gates in a series of interviews this week. Speaking to Axios, Melinda Gates said the only reason America was facing such a higher death toll than other developed countries was a "Lack of leadership." As Melinda put it: "We've had terrible leadership on this issue quite frankly. And science should never be politicized. Science is about getting at the truth." When asked if any other variable accounted for the impact of COVID-19 in the US compared to other developed countries, Melinda said it was "Our leadership and response" that was to blame. The interviews contain the harshest criticisms yet offered by the Gates of America's pandemic response, and coincide with the release of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's 2020 Goalkeepers report.

## Trump says there are 25 ‘witnesses’ disputing the Atlantic. Nope.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trump-says-there-are-25-witnesses-disputing-atlantic-nope/):

> In trying to refute the article, the White House has focused on its first anecdote - that Trump canceled a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018 because he did not believe it was important to honor American war dead."In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,'" Goldberg wrote. Goldberg's article does not even say the remarks happened during a discussion of the weather: "In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.' In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed." RETIRED MAJ. GEN. WILLIAM MATZ: "No one has done more for our veterans than President Trump, and he enjoys a relationship of mutual affection and honor with those who wear and have worn the uniform of the United States military and their families. Those who know President Trump know that the anonymous smears peddled by The Atlantic have no basis in fact or reality, and do a terrible disservice to journalism and to our veterans, living and deceased."

> This is not normal behavior from anyone, let alone the fucking president of the United States. But Trump’s behavior is so continually outrageous that it has been normalized — and Republicans are complicit in constructing this alternate reality.
> 
> Dictators and would-be dictators use these same tactics to gain power and control over their constituents. The more gaslighting continues, the more off-kilter and confused the population becomes, until people are too tired to fight back.
