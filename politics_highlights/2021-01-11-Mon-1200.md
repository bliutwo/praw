## We are national security and constitutional law experts who have studied violence and are working to head off any more in the coming weeks. It’s vital that attempts to terrorize our democracy are stopped and the laws enforced. Ask Us Anything!

> We are Mary McCord and Elizabeth Goitein and members of the non-partisan National Task Force on Election Crises. The violence that we have seen around the election is extremely dangerous for our democracy. It is vital that we all work to prevent it from continuing, and understand what our constitution and laws actually say about how elections and the transfer of power actually work - and what comes next.
