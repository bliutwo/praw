> There has been a very quick change of tack at most media outlets, in that they've actively stopped reporting misinformation from the president, such as when several outlets cut away from his event last night.
> 
> Do you think media is doing enough in this regard? It seems they've only started to realise the urgency of doing this when it's in relation to the election, when it directly threatens the principles of democracy in the US -- but Trump has been lying *for years*, and up to now the media has been reporting it verbatim, with little to no acknowledgement of the verifiable untruth in his statements.
> 
> Alternatively, do you think they are doing too much? As much as Trump's speech was questionable, some may see the refusal to air what he said as ideological suppression. The media has never really had to consider this in politics before as we've never had such a politically and emotionally charged president, but striking the balance between diligently reporting misinformation while not suppressing certain ideas seems to be a new concern for political media.

## Arizona flips! Navajos contribute to historic shift

Summary of [original article](https://navajotimes.com/rezpolitics/election-2020/arizona-flips-navajos-contribute-to-historic-shift/):

> WINDOW ROCK. For only the second time in the last 70 years, Arizona voters went for the Democratic candidate for president, and Navajo voters contributed to the swing. Most experts were attributing the swing to a large increase in the number of young Latinx voters in the southern part of the state. Voter participation in the three counties that include Navajo was up only four percent over the last presidential election in 2016 - but overall voter turnout in the state was actually down by nearly nine percentage points, which could reflect some disillusioned Republicans shying away from voting for Trump but not wanting to vote for Biden either.

## CNN reporter says it is 'poetry' that Trump's racist presidency ends with 'black woman in White House'

> (Un)funny anecdotal story I heard yesterday... a woman I know who's a huge trump supporter was talking to her other trump supporter friends here in Red Central of the Texas panhandle. She said that there was no way she could vote for someone like Biden because his VP is so confused that she doesn't even know what race she is. How can we have a VP that doesn't know their own race?
> 
> Anyway, that was so cringeworthy that I just had to get it off my chest.

## Arizona voters approve tax on wealthy to fund public schools

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5fa0783ec5b6869500317d55?ncid=+edlinkusaolp00000029):

> Proposition 208., dubbed Invest in Ed, will go into effect next year to fund salaries and training programs for teachers and support staff at public schools and public charters. The educators were protesting years of disinvestment in public schools that led to staff shortages and underfunded classrooms. Teacher unions helped fund the Arizona initiative, saying school districts pay staff too little to attract and retain talent.

`/u/kitties-plus-titties` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jp7tq0/arizona_voters_approve_tax_on_wealthy_to_fund/):

> This is how we get better schools; ladies and gentlemen.
> 
> Tax the wealthy to give back to the education system for a better America.
> 
> Republicans won't have that: because they want the money for themselves.
> 
> The Democrats want to give back to the people.
> 
> Here's your proof; Trump supporters. It's already happening. We haven't even officially won yet but we're already making steps to make it better for us.
> 
> Republicans can't say this.

## Trump tweets Philadelphia has 'rotten history' as city puts Biden on brink of election win

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-philadelphia-us-election-pennsylvania-b1644227.html):

> Donald Trump suggested that the city of Philadelphia has a "Rotten history on elections" in a tweet he wrote Friday morning. "Philadelpiha has got a rotten history on election integrity," Mr Trump tweeted, with a quote attribution to Mr Varney. Mr Varney is a long-time conservative commentator who has been generally favorable to Mr Trump.

`/u/PoppinKREAM` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jp75ey/trump_tweets_philadelphia_has_rotten_history_as/):

> I'm in Philadelphia, where our Constitution was drafted and signed. It wasn't a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery and failed to guarantee women -- and even men who didn't own property -- the right to participate in the political process. But embedded in this document was a North Star that would guide future generations; a system of representative government -- a democracy -- through which we could better realize our highest ideals. Through civil war and bitter struggles, we improved this Constitution to include the voices of those who'd once been left out. And gradually, we made this country more just, more equal, and more free.

> - Barack Obama, 2020
