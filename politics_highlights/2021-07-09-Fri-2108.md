## Biden fires head of Social Security Administration, a Trump holdover who drew the ire of Democrats

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/andrew-saul-social-security-/2021/07/09/c18a34fa-df99-11eb-a501-0e69b5d012e5_story.html):

> President Biden on Friday fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul, a holdover from the Trump administration who had alienated crucial Democratic constituencies with policies designed to clamp down benefits and an uncompromising anti-union stance. As word spread of Saul's possible dismissal, congressional Republicans on Friday accused the administration of politicizing the Social Security Administration and noted that Saul had been confirmed by the Senate by a wide margin. "President Biden needs someone who can fulfill his promise of protecting and strengthening Social Security," Rep. John B. Larson, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Social Security subcommittee, said in an interview Thursday.

> I can't say for certain that I have a wife who works for the Social Security Administration.  If I did have a wife that worked for the social security administration, I imagine she would end every day crying because of how awful things have been at work.  She's watched her union protections get taken away, good managers leave and terrible predators be replacements. She and I would have probably gone to a lot of therapy sessions together to help work through the added stress.  Why I could even surmise that she would have been infuriated when they told her they were taking her work from home privileges unless she met some fictional impossible standards in an unreasonably short amount of time.  Fictionally of course.

> So hypothetically, if that were the case: this is some of the best news that we could start this weekend with.

> Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania was filmed saying Republicans are opposed to Democrats carrying out the wishes of most voters. "No! No, no no, we don't want the people's will to be done immediately." Democrats are preparing to bypass Republicans on infrastructure using reconciliation, a pathway to approve budgetary bills with only a simple majority vote.

> They've never wanted the peoples' will done. Seems they want a permanent underclass to rule.  Eternal serfdom.  A bunch of sharecroppers doing their donor-classes bidding.  I'd like to be wrong but every action, ever piece of legislation they produce says as much.

## Trump tells supporters to ignore books after they reveal he complimented Hitler and joked about Khashoggi

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-pence-book-hitler-khashoggi-b1881271.html):

> Former President Donald Trump has slammed the new books written about him after one of them revealed that he allegedly complimented Adolf Hitler and joked about Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian journalist and US resident killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender writes in a new book that then-President Trump said "Well, Hitler did a lot of good things" to White House chief of staff John Kelly in 2018 while they were on a trip to Paris to commemorate the end of World War I. Mr Trump also pushed back on Mr Bender's reporting that the former president fought with then-Vice President Mike Pence over his political committee hiring Corey Lewandowski, a former 2016 campaign manager for Mr Trump. Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington told CNN on Wednesday: "This is totally false. President Trump never said this. It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired."

## Arizona Election Chief Calls for Criminal Investigation into Trump Team's 2020 Interference

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/arizona-trump-giuliani-election-criminal-investigation-1194967/):

> In an interview with MSNBC, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, referenced multiple phone calls made by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Trump himself to a county election official in Arizona, and said those calls should be probed by law enforcement to see if they constituted criminal election interference. The Arizona Republic, the state's largest newspaper, recently reported on the pressure campaign mounted by Trump and his acolytes aimed at local election officials in the days and weeks after Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona in the 2020 election. Under Arizona law, anyone who "Knowingly interferes" with an election official or "Induces" an election official to "Violate or refuse to comply with the officer's duty or any law regulating the election" violates the law, according a letter Secretary of State Hobbs sent to Arizona's attorney general.

`/u/waterdaemon` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oh2wxr/arizona_election_chief_calls_for_criminal/):

> A candidate or his lawyer even contacting election officials to discuss the count should warrant an investigation.

## Lincoln Project seeks to destroy ‘irredeemable’ GOP and leave it a ‘smoking ruin,’ co-founder says

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lincoln-project-destroy-republican-gop-b1881549.html):

> The Lincoln Project has revealed its new mission: to destroy the Republican Party. "The Republican Party must be defeated electorally anywhere and everywhere, and it must be left a smoking ruin so that someone can come in and rebuild a new, different, second party in this country," Reed Galen, one of the group's co-founders, told The Independent. The Lincoln Project endorsed Joe Biden that year, and focused its ads on "Messing with Trump's brain" and "Making him look more ridiculous." There's no way to measure the effect of that psychological campaign on the election, but Mr Biden did win.

`/u/fatthorthegreat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oh5w8k/lincoln_project_seeks_to_destroy_irredeemable_gop/):

> I've been a republican my whole life, I gave up on the Republicans after George Bush fucked the country and sent us into a 20 year war for really no reason. I voted Obama on the next General election and never looked back. 
> 
> As far as Trump goes, he's a peice of literal human garbage. He has no original ideas and clearly uses anyone he can. Look at how quick he turned on Bill Barr and Mike Pence, they literally did everything they could for him. He asked for one thing they couldn't do and boom they are dead to him.
> 
> He would throw anyone of his voters under the bus in seconds for almost nothing. If he thought it benefited him in the smallest way he wouldn't even think twice. And saying he would is the wrong statement, because he already has.
>
