## College students call on lawmakers to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/college-students-call-on-lawmakers-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour.html):

> As Congress considers raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, many college students say the wage hike would be a game changer for balancing work and school. Sade Andrews, a 20-year-old fast food worker at McDonald's, advocated for the successful ballot initiative in Florida last November that gradually raises the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour. While Democrats in Congress work to pass a higher minimum wage, Harper, the Vanderbilt student, encouraged her peers to advocate for themselves at their jobs.

> Not to erase the college students organizing, it's their future too, but minimum wage doesn't apply only to the young. The young and energetic deserve their article, but I also think the article cuts it down too narrowly, making it seem like raising the minimum wage is just a young person thing, when it's not, and has never been just for young people.

## 'Let the people vote': Biden signs executive order to expand voting access.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-signs-executive-action-ordering-agencies-expand-voting-access-n1259906):

> President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Sunday calling on federal agencies to expand voting access as part of his administration's efforts "To promote and defend the right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections." "It is the responsibility of the federal government to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy," the order read.Biden announced the order in virtual remarks played before the Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast, which commemorates the 1965 "Bloody Sunday" crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where Black demonstrators fighting for access to the ballot box were beaten by police along their march. Biden's action calls on federal agencies to "Consider ways to expand citizens' opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process," make it easier for federal employees to vote by providing recommendations on how to "Expand the federal government's policy of granting employees time off to vote in federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial elections," and increase access to the ballot for voters with disabilities, Native Americans, active-duty military service-members, overseas Americans and eligible federal prisoners.

> I will quote from a really interesting article addressing republicans (fake) voter concerns:
> 
> When it comes to voting rights, Republicans claim to be misunderstood. They insist they are not trying to suppress the vote; they just want to make voting more secure. For Republicans that means promoting in-person voting. 
> 
> 
> Even though I vehemently disagree with Republicans’ undermining of vote by mail, I am all for expanding access to in-person voting. So, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I want to propose a legislative reform that meets Republicans’ stated objective of encouraging in-person voting. States should pass laws prohibiting long lines at the polls. Specifically, states should prescribe by law that no voter should have to wait more than half an hour in order to cast a ballot.
> 
> 
> Here is how it would work. The new law would entitle voters to a wait time of 30 minutes or less when voting in person. If the state or a locality fails to meet this time limit, it must pay the affected voter for the time the voter spent waiting in line in excess of 30 minutes.

## McConnell planning an 'escape hatch' in case he leaves Senate before term expires, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-plans-possible-senate-exit-kentucky-legislature-report-2021-3):

> When former President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky became the most powerful Republican in Washington DC. With the upper chamber evenly split between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, 79-year-old McConnell, who was reelected to his seventh term last year, will most certainly fight hard to regain the majority in 2022. Under current state law, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear would have the power to pick McConnell's successor if he steps down from office, so McConnell is backing new legislation that would enable the state GOP to choose a replacement. While McConnell has not publicly given any indications that he is stepping down, he is also entering uncharted territory among the Senate GOP caucus.

>   
> The tl;dr for anyone who doesn't want to read the whole article.  Typical Republican tactics, trying to change the rules to benefit themselves.

> I used to question the logic of a $15/hour federal minimum wage. Then a local fast food burger chain here in Austin did it on their own. They paid for it by raising prices by a mere 2%. 
> 
> If that’s really all it takes, I’m all for it.
