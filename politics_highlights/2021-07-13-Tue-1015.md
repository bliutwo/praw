## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 28

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oiu6wd/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

## Calls for a Bolder Congress Follow Texas Dems' Exodus to Thwart GOP Anti-Voter Bills | "Democrats in the U.S. Senate could learn a lot from these Texas Democrats—sometimes you have to pull out all the stops to protect democracy."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/12/calls-bolder-congress-follow-texas-dems-exodus-thwart-gop-anti-voter-bills):

> As Texas state Democratic lawmakers on Monday undertook a daring effort to deny their Republican colleagues the quorum needed to ram through a sweeping voter suppression package, progressive advocates and observers implored congressional Democrats to act boldly to protect U.S. democracy from the GOP onslaught. A pair of GOP bills supported by the Republican governor would ban drive-thru and 24-hour voting, restrict mail-in voting, increase penalties for voting mistakes, and further empower partisan poll watchers. Once again, Democrats are standing strong and united to defend the right of every eligible Texas voter to make their voice heard.

> There’s no more theoretical threat to democracy. Republicans attempted a coup that ended in murder. There’s no reaching out anymore. They are not interested. The time for that has passed. It’s time for big action and accountability.

> The Big Lie is an excuse to enact the voter restrictions they have always wanted.  Now that Supreme Court has neutered the Voting Rights Act, Jim Crow is back!  And bigger than ever...baby. Stand by for literacy tests and poll taxes.

## Texas Governor Vows To Arrest Democrats Who Fled State

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/texas-voting-bill-governor-democrats-b1883101.html):

> Texas' governor has called Democrats in the state's legislature who fled for Washington to prevent the passage of Republican-led voting bills "Hypocrites" and vowed they will be arrested upon their return. The governor went on to say that the state's House of Representatives has the power to issue a call for the arrest of lawmakers who obstruct voting practices but only in the state of Texas. He said: "Once they step back into the state of Texas they will be arrested and brought to the Texas Capitol and we will be conducting business."

## The Less Trump Pays for Jan. 6, the More It Costs Us

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/opinion/jan-6-trump-impunity.html):

> Alexander Stephens, the Confederate vice president, whose "Cornerstone" speech defined the secessionist cause, served five terms in Congress after the war and also died a free man. Most of the leaders of the deadliest insurrection in American history died free men, pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in the first years of Reconstruction and released from federal custody - if they were ever arrested in the first place. Howell Cobb of Georgia, for example, was president of the secession convention, a drafter of the Confederate constitution, a member of the Confederate Congress and an officer in the Confederate Army.

`/u/straygoat193` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ojgo6p/the_less_trump_pays_for_jan_6_the_more_it_costs_us/):

> Six months later, hundreds of indictments, a few plea deals and we are no closer to the truth.  The insurrection continues in a new form, changing the voting rules to permit the overturning of an election.  The main fundraisers and organizers have not been served.
> 
> There must be a penalty or else they will do it again and maybe succeed

## This Governor Withdrew From A Climate Pact. Days Later, He’s Pleading For Help With Drought.

`/u/marndar` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ojbqfu/this_governor_withdrew_from_a_climate_pact_days/):

> I vacationed in Montana two summers ago (near Glacier National Park). Gorgeous country - there was plenty of snow in the mountains on July 4th but I'm guessing the snowpack has long melted this year. Our river rafting guide was a firefighter in the fall, and he was warning us how Montana's climate was changing for the worse. It's crazy to think Montana has had a hotter summer this year than I've seen in Texas. Of course, we're dealing with record rain or else, we'd probably be dealing with the oppressive heat too. The climate extremes are ridiculous, and things are just going to get worse and worse. Every single state needs to do something to combat the changes. I truly believe 90 percent of Americans between the ages of 16 and 30 realize this - it's the older people (Republicans mostly) that are such fools.
