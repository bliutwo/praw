## Fascism Scholar Says U.S. Is 'Losing Its Democratic Status'

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/06/910320018/fascism-scholar-says-u-s-is-losing-its-democratic-status?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news):

> Some of the racial justice protesters this summer have said they are fighting fascism in the form of President Trump. Stanley, who is the author of the 2018 book How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them, tells NPR's All Things Considered: "The leader proposes that only he can solve it and all of his political opponents are enemies or traitors." What would you think about that country? Where would you think the direction of that country was headed? I would think that country was losing its democratic status, especially when it had a history of voter suppression and the highest incarceration rate in the world as background conditions.

> That news is on the radar of the attorney general of North Carolina, where DeJoy was based. Five former employees said Dejoy or his aides urged them to make contributions and attend fundraisers at his mansion in Greensboro, North Carolina. DeJoy spokesman Monty Hagler told the outlet that Dejoy was never told by these employees of any pressure, and "He regrets if any employee felt uncomfortable for any reason." The spox said Dejoy got legal advice from a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission "To ensure that he, New Breed Logistics and any person affiliated with New Breed fully complied with any and all laws. Mr. DeJoy believes that all campaign fundraising laws and regulations should be complied with in all respects."

## Trump, under fire for alleged comments about veterans, has a long history of disparaging military service

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-under-fire-for-alleged-comments-about-veterans-has-a-long-history-of-disparaging-military-service/2020/09/06/76aba4b8-f053-11ea-9279-45d6bdfe145f_story.html):

> Long before Trump's views of the military would emerge as a flash point in his 2020 reelection campaign - before he would shock the political world with the more widely seen 2015 attack on McCain, in which he said the senator was "Not a war hero" and declared, "I like people who weren't captured" - Trump had a long track record of incendiary and disparaging remarks about veterans and military service. Trump's long periods of separation from his family at such an early age, as he was thrust into a militaristic regimen for which he had little aptitude, may have embittered him and created resentment toward some military figures, according to schoolmate John Bolog, who lived a few blocks from Trump in their Jamaica Estates neighborhood and often shared a ride with him when one of their mothers drove them to the academy. Trump withdrew from the campaign in February 2000.As Trump prepared for his 2016 bid, he told his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, to prepare for questions about his lack of military service, Cohen later told the House Oversight Committee.

## Michael Cohen claims Trump ogled his 15-year-old daughter in new memoir

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-michael-cohen-book-miss-universe-b404593.html):

> Michael Cohen claims that Donald Trump ogled his teenage daughter in his explosive new memoir, according to the Associated Press. The disgraced attorney, who was one of the president's closest confidants and "Fixer" for years, describes an uncomfortable incident in the book when Mr Trump allegedly leered at Cohen's 15-year-old daughter. In congressional testimony from 2019, shortly before his prison sentence began, Cohen explained how he helped Mr Trump commit financial fraud by inflating the worth of his assets to attain bank loans, but deflating those same assets on his tax forms to pay less in taxes.

> Documented he perved on underage girls in the Miss Teen Universe pageants too.

> Which makes QAnon followers even more stupid, fwiw.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/09/06/alleged-affair-between/):

> In 2018, President Donald Trump found himself in the middle of a sex scandal after The Wall Street Journal revealed that adult-film star Stormy Daniels had received $130,000 for signing a nondisclosure agreement just before the 2016 presidential election about an affair she reportedly had with Trump in 2006. Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer who is serving a three-year federal prison sentence, alleges in his upcoming book that Trump was well aware of Cohen's payoff to Daniels, according to The Washington Post. According to The Post, Cohen writes that Trump agreed to pay Daniels $130,000 for her silence.

`/u/teslacoil1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/inwava/alleged_affair_between_president_trump_and_stormy/):

> Ok, let’s put aside all the crimes that Trump committed and all the criminals he has hired.  Let’s also put aside that he lies pathologically.  And let’s put aside that he gassed peaceful protestors so that he could use a church as a photo op.
> 
> Donald Trump cheated on one wife after another, after another. Above all, Donald Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star!
> 
> How can Christians still support this man?  He does everything opposite of what Jesus teaches.  He represents everything that Christians shouldn’t do.  SMH.
