## Mitch McConnell says he would vote for Trump again days after saying he was 'practically and morally responsible' for the deadly insurrection

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-mcconnell-says-he-would-support-trump-despite-capitol-siege-2021-2):

> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he would back Donald Trump if he were the Republican Party's nominee for president again. After voting to acquit Trump on February 13 following his Senate impeachment trial, McConnell said the mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol were "Fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on earth because he was angry he'd lost an election." McConnell explained his vote to acquit by saying that impeachment was not the right avenue to hold Trump responsible given that its punishment is removal from office, and Trump had already left office by then.

## Republican Senators Haven’t Represented a Majority of Voters Since 1996

Summary of [original article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/gop-senators-havent-represented-a-majority-since-1996.html):

> As we wait for the Senate parliamentarian to let us know if 41 senators will be able to block a minimum-wage increase that a comfortable majority of Americans supports, it's as good a time as any to be reminded of the non-representative nature of the Senate Republican Conference. Republican senators haven't represented a majority of the U.S. population since 1996 and haven't together won a majority of Senate votes since 1998. Thanks to the filibuster, of course, on many key measures, the 43.5 percent of voters represented by a Republican minority in the Senate have as much clout as the 44.7 percent represented by a Republican majority when the GOP won a trifecta four years ago.

> I am starting to think a bunch of human-traffickers from the 18th Century didn't design a perfect government.

## Equality Act Passes House, Despite Republican Temper Tantrums

Summary of [original article](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2021/02/25/55470599/equality-act-passes-house-despite-republican-temper-tantrums):

> CSPAN.The House just voted by a slim margin to approve the Equality Act, 224 to 206. The gist of the Equality Act is that it would add gender identity and sexual orientation to a list of already-protected classes, so you couldn't be fired or expelled or evicted on those bases. Discrimination against queer people causes increased health risks, financial problems, educational issues - the Equality Act addresses all that, and the objections to it are simply made up.

`/u/bsmart08` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lsj487/equality_act_passes_house_despite_republican/):

> >after the bill passed, Republicans invoked an irritating procedural process to reconsider it, knowing that it would fail but it would also waste about 45 minutes to count another round of votes.
> 
> Are they trying to be completely irrelevant? Don't answer that.

## Sanders says Walmart pays workers "starvation wages," taxpayers make up difference

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/sanders-says-walmart-pays-workers-starvation-wages-taxpayers-make-difference-1572114):

> "Walmart pays wages so low that tens of thousands of their workers are forced to rely on public assistance in order to survive," Sanders said Thursday in a meeting of the Senate Budget Committee. The Higher Wages for American Workers Act is based on data from the Congressional Budget Office that says an increase to $15 an hour would lead to mass unemployment-a statistic Sanders rebuked in his statement Thursday. Sanders also made it clear that a $15 wage rate would help workers at big corporations like Walmart as much as small businesses: "I am also sympathetic to providing small businesses with the tax relief that they need to offset some of the increased labor costs associated with a minimum wage increase-just as Congress has done virtually every time that it has increased the minimum wage."

## Mitch McConnell Says He’ll Support Trump in 2024 After Blaming Him for Capitol Riot

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mitch-mcconnell-says-hell-support-trump-in-2024-after-blaming-him-for-capitol-riot):

> Less than two weeks after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that there was "No question-none-that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking" the insurrectionist attack on the U.S. Capitol-while simultaneously voting to acquit on impeachment-he told Fox News on Thursday evening that he would "Absolutely" support Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024. At first, McConnell hedged a bit, saying, "There's a lot to happen between now and '24" and adding, "I've got four members, I think, that are planning on running for president, plus some governors and others." With no incumbent Republican running, McConnell said, "It should be a wide open race and fun for you all to cover." When Baier then asked him directly if he would support Trump should he become the nominee, McConnell answered, "The nominee of the party? Absolutely."

`/u/Tots4trump` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lslz8g/mitch_mcconnell_says_hell_support_trump_in_2024/):

> They will support anyone their base supports and who give them power regardless of how hypocritical, destructive or awful. I’m not embellishing when I say this is a cancer that is going to rot and destroy this country. And republicans are okay with it because they hate this country as it is. They want to raze it to the ground and go back to pre-FDR days and they think, if they succeed, they will be the king shits, and not the serfs. Their lives will improve if only they can destroy our current society, which isn’t *real* America. This is what they think. This is why you can’t reason with them or provide them facts to change their minds.
