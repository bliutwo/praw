> In Puerto Rico:
> 
> A crime that seems taken out of a horror movie paralyzed Puerto Rico last week took another turn when [boxer Felix Verdejo turned himself in](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/tribunales/notas/felix-verdejo-quedo-ingresado-en-prision-sin-fianza/) for the murder of Keishla Rodriguez Ortiz.
> 
> Keishla, 27, was reported missing last week after failing  to show up for work on Thursday.
> She was supposed to meet with Verdejo to discuss her nearly two monthlong pregnancy. Verdejo, who while married had kept a relationship with Keishla for more than a decade made no comment during initial questioning. On Friday her car was found in a rural area and on Ssturday her body was found in a lagoon in San Juan.
> 
> In a sad spectacle local news reported live as her body was recovered from the water and taken for examination.
> 
> On Sunday a cooperating witness tipped off the FBI and the details emerged. Keishla after meeting with Verdejo was punched, drugged and tossed from a bridge and shot from the bridge while tied to cinder blocks.
> 
> Verdejo used his own vehicle and toseed her from a tolled bridge with cameras. He faces the death penalty.
> 
> This case along with Andrea Ruiz Costas, who was also murdered recently have brought the domestic violence issue once again to the forefront with spontaneous protests happening in various parts of the island. In Andrea's case the ire is being directed against judges who determined that no charges should be filed against the aggressor who later killed her.[Here are more details](https://www.elvocero.com/ley-y-orden/seg-n-la-polic-a-la-expareja-de-andrea-ruiz-costas-confes-el-crimen-y/article_bb457b22-aa83-11eb-a3d8-fbdedb56832f.html)
> 
> In another sad day for Puerto Rico former governor of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcelo , has passed away. [A giant of liberalism ](https://www.elvocero.com/noticia_rotary/article_4bdd6096-ac14-11eb-89bf-37154de91192.html) and proponent of statehood Romero Barcelo was elected to nearly every statewide office, being mayor of San Juan, a Senator, two term governor and Resident commissioner.
> 
> As a founding member of the New Progressive Party  Romero brought down the hegemony of the PPD in Puerto Rico, raised minimum wages in PR by asking Congress to extend minimum wage laws to the island and increased taxes to foreign corporations doing business in Puerto Rico.
> 
> He lost reelection to a third term amid the Cerro Maravilla scandal (where two independence activists were murdered by police) but his political opponents revived his political career by continuing to try to demonize him for the crimes(something that goes on to this day) They were never able to prove any wrongdoing or a coverup extending  to hin and this effort ended with him elected to straight terms to Congress.

> He's now threatening to stop turning the blind eye, not because of how fucked up that is in the first place, but because the companies paying him bribes are in favor of voting rights and he's strongly against that.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-poisoning-democracy-with-big-lie-claim-key-house-republican-2021-05-03/):

> The No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday said former President Donald Trump was "Poisoning our democratic system" with his persistent false claims that his November election defeat was the result of fraud. "The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system," Cheney tweeted without mentioning Trump by name. Cheney survived an effort by Trump allies to oust her as House Republican Conference chairwoman this year after joining nine other House Republicans to vote for his impeachment on Jan. 13."PREDICTION: she'll be out of her GOP leadership role by month's end!" Texas Republican Lance Gooden tweeted over the weekend.

## “Long overdue”: The Senate just passed $35 billion for clean drinking water.

Summary of [original article](https://grist.org/article/long-overdue-the-senate-just-passed-35-billion-for-clean-drinking-water/?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=124868690&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Kspfvvc4w3fwCPi0oqPFtybxZLsxZRw2QLk-544VJiD4M1Ex14YymMMI3XPxv5B252XFgoxCZCFoW527f9teNriYokQ):

> The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act would create a $35 billion fund for states and tribes to improve water systems - 40 percent of which would go to underserved, rural, and tribal communities. More than 2 million Americans live without access to drinking water and sanitation services - such as safe drinking water, plumbing in the home, and wastewater removal and treatment - according to a 2019 report by the U.S. Water Alliance. While federal funds for water systems were plentiful following the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act in the 1970s, federal investment has declined dramatically, from 63 percent of capital spending in the water sector in 1977 to just 9 percent in 2017.
