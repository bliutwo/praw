Summary of [original article](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/12/06/washington_must_grant_puerto_rico_statehood_finally_144793.html):

> The time has come for Congress to grant statehood to Puerto Rico after more than 122 years of colonial rule by the United States. During the past few years, statehood for Puerto Rico has gathered unprecedented support from Congress members on both sides of the aisle. In mid-September, during a public engagement, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden made it clear he backs statehood for Puerto Rico.

> Oh look an idea that the majority of people support. Expect it to get shot down by our minority rule overlords.
