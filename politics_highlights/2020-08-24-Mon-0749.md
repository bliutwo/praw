## I never thought I would leave the Republican Party, but I'm voting Biden-Harris this fall | I watched the Democratic convention without a Republican lens and found an embrace of justice and diversity. Trump's convention will be a contrast.

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/24/trump-ruined-republican-party-for-me-choosing-biden-2020-column/3424095001/):

> Four and a half years ago I considered myself a Republican, but then Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for president. If you had told me that eight years later I would leave the Republican Party and that 12 years later I would be voting for Biden and Harris, I would have thought you were crazy. Character counts:Joe Biden battles Donald Trump for the soul of America.

## Data show Trump didn't 'build' a great economy. He inherited it.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/data-show-trump-didn-t-build-great-economy-he-inherited-n1237793):

> It suggests Trump didn't build something new; rather he inherited a pretty good situation. Second, the growth that began in Obama's second term and essentially continued under Trump was enough to create an economy that even Trump believes was great. Job numbers for Obama and Trump show a similar story.

> Can you imagine how much better we'd all be, economically and otherwise, if we had a competent government? 
> 
> More than Trump, the GOP had all branches in 2016, 2017 and they did nothing.
> 
> Now all they do is obstruct.

## For Conservatives to Have Any Hope, Trump Has to Lose | After what we have seen during the president’s first term, any true conservative should be appalled by the prospect of a second.

## GOP Will Not Write a 2020 Platform, Pledges Undying Trump Support Instead

Summary of [original article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/republican-national-committee-2020-platform-trump.html):

> Blake News August 22, 2020 And perhaps most remarkably of all, the party has announced it will forego a platform altogether. The official excuse is that the coronavirus has made it impossible for the party to get together and write a platform: "The Republican National Committee has significantly scaled back the size and scope of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Charlotte due to strict restrictions on gatherings and meetings, and out of concern for the safety of convention attendees and our hosts." Yet somehow the Democrats managed to come up with a platform without killing anybody. The official disregard of any platform - save whatever Trump says - is the most perfectly fitting encapsulation of the GOP in 2020.

`/u/ennuinerdog` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ifhtmh/gop_will_not_write_a_2020_platform_pledges/):

> >WHEREAS, The RNC enthusiastically supports President Trump and continues to reject the

> Democratic National Committee today; therefore, be it
> RESOLVED, That the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the 
> President’s America-first agenda;
> 
> 
> Their only policy is that they oppose all of the Democrats policies. Their official sole reason to exist and complete theory of governance is to Own The Libs while maintaining total loyalty to Trump.
