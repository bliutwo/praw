## Schiff: 'No reason' Trump should get intel briefings ever again

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/534624-schiff-no-reason-trump-should-get-intel-briefings-ever-again):

> House Intelligence Committee Chairman said Sunday should no longer receive daily intelligence briefings and be prohibited from receiving such briefings once he leaves office. The intelligence committee chairman went on to suggest that he thought that U.S. allies had begun withholding intelligence from the Trump administration due to fears about the president's ability or willingness to keep such intelligence private, a prospect Schiff said "Makes us less safe." Gordon, who left the Trump administration in 2019, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Friday that President-elect Biden should move to deny Trump intelligence briefings after Trump departs from the White House.

## From Paul Ryan to Nikki Haley: GOP Nightmare of Senate Budget Chair Bernie Sanders About to Come True

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/01/17/paul-ryan-nikki-haley-gop-nightmare-senate-budget-chair-bernie-sanders-about-come):

> "Time to face the harsh reality, socialist Bernie Sanders will become the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He has vowed to use his position to enact his progressive agenda on healthcare, climate, infrastructure spending, and cutting defense spending," Nikki Haley tweeted Saturday. "Republican fears of Sanders taking over the committee go back to at least 2016 when Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, then Speaker of the GOP-controlled House, said ahead of that year's election:"If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. Among the chief powers that the chair of the committee will be able to utilize is fostering legislation through the Senate using the budget reconciliation process-a procedural tool that will allow, even under current rules, legislation to pass with a simple majority.

>  "When Republicans controlled the Senate they used the reconciliation process to provide huge tax breaks for the rich and large corporations," said Sanders on Saturday. "We're going to use reconciliation to protect working families, the sick and the poor."

## Booker: It would be 'constitutionally dangerous' not to conduct full Trump impeachment trial

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/534625-booker-it-is-constitutionally-dangerous-not-to-conduct-full-trump):

> Sen. said Sunday that the Senate has an "Obligation" to conduct 's second impeachment trial even after he leaves office. Asked to respond to Sen. 's claim that a post-presidency trial is unconstitutional, Booker responded, "I believe it is constitutionally dangerous not to proceed." Senate Democrats are hoping to conduct his trial as swiftly as possible to avoid slowing the start of President-elect 's new administration.

> “We just had a president of the United States try to undermine the peaceful transition of power. Try to challenge a fair and free election, and him and his agents, in the moments before from his son to his lawyer, whipping up a crowd to go attack the Capitol,” he added. **“So, I believe fundamentally the Senate has an obligation to act.”**
> 
> “You need the Republican leader to cooperate in terms of time agreements. But I fully expect it to happen as quickly as possible. And I think what else is going to happen is that we're going to be able to do a lot of things at once. I think we should,” he continued. **“If we can get the time agreements from our Republican leader, we can actually hold impeachment trials as well as do other urgently critical things like getting key national security personnel confirmed as well.”**

## Karl Rove: ‘Strong Likelihood’ Trump Will Be Convicted if Giuliani Leads Impeachment Defense

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/karl-rove-says-strong-likelihood-trump-will-be-convicted-if-giuliani-leads-impeachment-defense?ref=home):

> Fox News contributor Karl Rove lamented on Sunday that if Rudy Giuliani leads President Donald Trump's impeachment defense in the Senate, there is a "Strong likelihood" the president will be convicted. Over the weekend, Giuliani-who infamously called for "Trial by combat" hours before the Capitol riot-told ABC News that he's on the president's second impeachment defense team and that he will argue Trump couldn't have incited a riotous mob to attack the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election. Rove went on to say that Trump and his allies have had every opportunity to prove their baseless allegations in court and failed to do so over and over, reiterating that if Giuliani goes down this road "It raises the likelihood of more than 17 Republicans voting for conviction."

`/u/beardednutgargler` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kzaptt/karl_rove_strong_likelihood_trump_will_be/):

> Does Trump have any other choice? It seems nobody wants to defend him anyway. Trump should be convicted either way, we all (the world) watched it all lived stream from 100's of angles.

## Rove: Chances of conviction rise if Giuliani represents Trump in Senate impeachment trial

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/534618-rove-chances-of-conviction-rise-if-giuliani-represents-trump):

> Republican strategist suggested on Sunday that is at higher risk of the Senate voting to convict him in his second impeachment trial if his personal attorney spearheads his defense. Rove said during a "Fox News Sunday" appearance that Senate Majority Leader 's statements on the trial, in which he did not instruct Senate Republicans to vote against conviction, are "a sign that every Republican senator needs to take this seriously." "Rudy Giuliani charted a very bad course in the morning papers," Rove said, pointing to comments by the attorney suggesting the president could not have incited the deadly riots at the Capitol earlier this month because his unproven claims of election theft were true.

> I feel like him and Trump in court together is the series finale we all deserve
