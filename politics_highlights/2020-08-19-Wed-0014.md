## Susan Collins Engineered the USPS Disaster She’s Now Protesting

Summary of [original article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/18/susan-collins-engineered-the-usps-disaster-shes-now-protesting/):

> Despite the unique threat these moves have posed to American democracy, the only GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill to speak out are those facing competitive re-elections this fall, such as Montana Senator Steve Daines and Maine Senator Susan Collins. At the same time, it effectively blocked the USPS from taking advantage of new opportunities to provide services and garner revenue when it needed to make up for losses stemming from declines in first-class mail due to the rise of the Internet and email. On Tuesday, amid a growing outcry from state attorneys general, Democratic lawmakers, USPS workers, and average citizens fearful about mounting delays in delivery of their medication, the Postmaster General announced that he would suspend the policies he's instituted that have slowed the nation's mail service.

## Trump was 'infuriated' by efforts to stop Russian election meddling, ex-DHS official alleges

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/election-2020-russia-meddling-homeland-security-trump-miles-taylor-a9676926.html):

> "We were quite literally told, 'Do not bring up issues related to Russia with the president. It might be counterproductive,'" said Miles Taylor, a former DHS chief of staff who has endorsed Joe Biden's presidency in a damning op-ed column and in a video from an anti-Trump Republican group. At one meeting to discuss US counties facing potential election threats, the president "Wanted to talk about how many counties he had won in 2016.". The president's "Indiscipline was also a constant source of frustration," he claimed, pointing to a February 2019 meeting to avoid a possible government shutdown in which Mr Trump held a phone briefing with DHS to "Discuss the colour of the wall".

## Colin Powell backs Biden ahead of DNC appearance

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/colin-powell-endorse-biden-2020-c2e12496-242f-4b87-b3bf-2f5d925ccac5.html):

> Former Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed Joe Biden for president and will appear at the Democratic Convention Tuesday evening, NBC first reported. Why it matters: Powell is the highest profile Republican to cross party lines, throwing his support behind Biden and adding his name to a growing list of GOP voices who are encouraging voters to support the former vice president over President Trump. "For Joe Biden, that doesn't need teaching - it comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families."

> Is it bad that I hope the DNC just becomes the new center right party, the Republicans just stop existing as a viable party, and we get an actual left leaning party in the US?

> WILMINGTON, Del. - The widow of Republican Senator John McCain will speak at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday on behalf of presidential candidate Joe Biden, offering a reminder of her late husband's bitter relationship with President Donald Trump. The bitterness was so deep that McCain, who helped plan his own funeral in 2018, made it clear to family that he wanted Biden to speak and that Trump was not welcome. "My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship," Cindy McCain posted on Twitter.

> How tone deaf and arrogant can Trump be? After he DODGES military service with a phony doctors note supplied by his rich daddy, he has the nerve to make statements like "I like people who weren't captured" about hero McCain. SMH.
