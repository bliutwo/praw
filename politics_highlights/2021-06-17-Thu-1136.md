> Republicans cried for 8yrs that they had a better plan than the ACA. Then when they had control of the House, Senate, and White House they still claimed a better plan was coming. When the time came to reveal their plan Senate members literally filled folders with blank printer paper to make it appear like they had something. Republicans opposition to the ACA is a national embarrassment. A total disgrace to governance.

## Senate Democrats weigh $6T infrastructure bill, without GOP

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/17/senate-democrats-infrastructure-reconciliation-494977):

> The details of the bigger plan come as a bipartisan group of senators, led by Sens. Democrats' separate considerations of an infrastructure bill as big as $6 trillion - more than President Joe Biden's initial $4 trillion-plus plan - don't necessarily suggest they're preparing for those talks to run aground. The bigger framework includes provisions that could be added to a separate infrastructure bill passed along party lines even if the bipartisan talks pay off.

`/u/RedditAtWork2021` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o1wayo/senate_democrats_weigh_6t_infrastructure_bill/):

> Let’s be clear here.  Republicans had their chance to come to the table in good faith and did not.  It is not that Democrats are wanting to do this without GOP, it’s that the GOP is refusing to work on anything other than obstruction.

> Anyone who thinks this wasn't as serious as it truly was is in complete denial.
> 
> It is irrelevant how many building where burned down, how many stores were looted, or how many streets were closed down.
> 
> You had a single government building containing the highest government officials in our nation, far right groups with the desire to harm/kill these officials, and a ruthless mob chanting for the execution of the second highest government official in that building.
> 
> All this while the mob beat officers, overcame barricades, and was backed by president.
> 
> On top of this you have revelations like members of the mob being taken through the building by GOP members earlier in the week, the president withholding help, directions for officers protecting the building to not have essential riot gear, and so much more.
> 
> If you do not see this as an attempted coup you are in denial or complicit in the actions that happened on January 6th.

> >"I was very cordial. I extended my hand to shake his hand. He just stared at me. I asked if he was going to shake my hand, and he told me that he didn't who know I was. So I introduced myself. I said that I was Officer Michael Fanone. That I was a DC Metropolitan Police officer who fought on January 6 to defend the Capitol and, as a result, I suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a heart attack after having been tased numerous times at the base of my skull, as well as being severely beaten," Fanone said. "At that point, the congressman turned away from me."  
> >  
> >Once the elevator doors opened, Fanone said, the congressman "ran as quickly as he could, like a coward."
> 
> Running away from tense situations is the default response from any GQP politicians.
