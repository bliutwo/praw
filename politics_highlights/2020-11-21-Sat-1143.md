## Failed GOP candidate who denounced Pete Buttigieg’s “homo-ocracy” gets COVID after claiming immunity

Summary of [original article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/11/failed-gop-candidate-denounced-pete-buttigiegs-homo-ocracy-gets-covid-claiming-immunity/):

> E.W. Jackson - a failed Republican Senate candidate, conservative pundit, and Christian pastor with a long history of extreme anti-LGBTQ statements - has been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus after he claimed he couldn't get it because "I've taken my vaccine, and my vaccine is Psalm 91.". In a Facebook Live sermon earlier this week, Jackson said that both he and his wife had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus even after claiming multiple times that he wouldn't get it. Jackson has a long history of anti-LGBTQ statements, complaining just last year about Pete Buttigieg and the "Gay mafia" imposing a "Homo-ocracy" on America.

## Trump Organization's consulting payments to Ivanka Trump are focus of NY tax probe

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-investigating-trump-tax-write-offs-ivanka/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=105059795):

> New York's attorney general has sent a subpoena to the Trump Organization for records related to consulting fees paid to Ivanka Trump as part of a broad civil investigation into the president's business dealings, a law enforcement official said Thursday. The records requests followed recent reporting in The Times, based partly on two decades' worth of Trump's tax filings, that the president had reduced his company's income tax liability over several years by deducting $26 million in consulting fees as a business expense. Records strongly suggested, The Times reported, that $747,622 of those fees had been paid to Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, through a company she owned at a time when she was also a Trump Organization executive.

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/526995-judge-tosses-last-election-lawsuit-in-arizona):

> An Arizona judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit from two voters alleging mishandled ballots, the final election-related case pending in the state that voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in more than 20 years. Alexander Kolodin, the lawyer representing the two plaintiffs, argued that Drobina's ballot should not have been reviewed by election officials, adding that state law requires machines - when operating properly - to "Record correctly and count accurately every vote cast." Arizona has a Nov. 30 deadline for certifying election results.

## Trump's defeat by Joe Biden has triggered a huge wave of relief among the United States' European allies

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-victory-donald-trump-triggered-huge-relief-in-europe-2020-11):

> There was a huge collective sigh of relief in Berlin when it became clear that Joe Biden had beaten Donald Trump in the presidential election earlier this month. "This is all taken with a bit of a grain of salt," said Puglierin, "Because many people think Biden is a president of transition - that he won't do a second term, and that the election of Donald Trump and this election has shown that another Trump figure - or Trump again - can win in four years." Antony Blinken, Biden's chief foreign policy adviser, has promised to end what he calls the "Artificial trade war" Trump started between the US and the EU. But that does not mean Biden will lift sanctions on exports such as steel and aluminum on day one.

> "Relief" is the major emotion I've been feeling for two weeks now.  I'm nauseated by the latest b.s. he's pulling post-election, but if somehow he'd been actually reelected I'd be a basket case right now.  I'm sure I'm not alone on this, right here in the good old USA.  Breathe deep, and say it again everyone "Just two more months ... two more months ..."
