## Congress seals Bidenâ€™s victory despite Trump-inspired mob pushing American democracy to the brink

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/biden-certified-congress-trump-capitol-lockdown-b1783630.html):

> "To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today: you did not win. Violence never wins. Freedom wins," the vice president said in remarks that stood in sharp contrast to a short video Mr Trump posted essentially defending the angry mob he incited at a rally around midday. If Mr Pence and the president's Cabinet don't invoke the 25th Amendment to replace Mr Trump, Congress "Must immediately impeach and remove the president for the safety of our nation," Mr Moulton said. "We just had a violent mob assault the US Capitol. ... No question the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. He lit the flame," Ms Cheney said.

## The GOP Is No Longer a Viable Governing Party

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-gop-protest-washington/):

> The day Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, urged "Trial by combat." The day that, despite the most seditious acts since the Civil War, six US senators and 121 members of the House later that evening voted against certifying Arizona's election results. January 6, 2021: the day the GOP was finally, unavoidably, confronted with the lethal consequences of tolerating a demagogue for four years. The day the cretinous, opportunistic Republican Party was forced to confront the fact that, as JFK once put it, if you seek to ride the tiger, you end up in its belly.

`/u/UnderwaterFloridaMan` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ksc7ri/the_gop_is_no_longer_a_viable_governing_party/):

Citing a Trump advisor, that people close to Trump were "Certain the president wanted this and is enjoying it." Trump has in recent days called on Pence repeatedly to reject Electoral College votes for Biden and declare Trump as the winner of the 2020 election instead - something the vice president has no power to do.

## Here are the 129 members of Congress who just voted to support a conspiracy-fueled mob

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218285/twitter-facebook-trump-coup):

> On January 6th, 2021, President Donald Trump, the former reality television star of NBC's The Apprentice, escalated his assault on 244 years of democratic rule by inciting a mob of his supporters to break into the US Capitol building. Last June, after Trump ordered armed federal authorities to attack peaceful protesters in Washington, DC, I argued that platforms should ban both Trump and those in Congress who continued to enable his violence. They voted to support the president's lie that the election was stolen, even after the president directed his supporters to assault the Congress.

## White House counsel reportedly concerned Trump was committing treason

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/959369/white-house-counsel-reportedly-concerned-trump-committing-treason):

> After supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, several White House staffers worried that they were unwitting participants in a coup, Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman reports. One staffer told a friend that White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was warning officials to stay away from Trump, so they wouldn't appear to be assisting or enabling his actions, Sherman reports. One Republican close to the White House told Sherman that several business leaders, horrified by what they saw happening at the Capitol, tried to call Trump to ask him to call off the mob, but he refused to take any calls.

> Counting of Electoral votes used to be one of the most routine and boring Congressional processes.  Until the man with 7 bankruptcies showed up.  There's a reason the man has disastrous business resume.
