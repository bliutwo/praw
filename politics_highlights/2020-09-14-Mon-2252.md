## ‘We Weren’t Alarmist Enough’: Experts Warn Trump and GOP Could Destroy Democracy

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f5fb18fc5b6e27db1314744):

> When Trump won in 2016, there was a general belief among experts that while he would test U.S. democracy, he likely wouldn't lay waste to it entirely. Voters might not care about an obscure federal statute, but "The violation of the Hatch Act is incredibly significant for U.S. democracy," Smith said, "Because the Hatch Act gets to the heart of protecting democracy from one of the players systematically stacking the deck." The 2016 election, Levitsky said, was a sign that too many Americans had "Gotten to the point where we take our democracy for granted, meaning that no matter how reckless we are, we believe we can't break our democracy."

`/u/WDfx2EU` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/isus1t/we_werent_alarmist_enough_experts_warn_trump_and/):

> Some of us were as alarmist as possible from the beginning, but we were criticized for not exercising "decency". EVERYTHING we said came true.

## ‘No citizen is above the law’: New York lawmakers want to make it easier to prosecute ex-presidents for crimes they commit in office

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/new-york-prosecute-donald-trump-law-michael-gianaris-nick-perry-b440612.html):

> A bill by New York lawmakers aims to make it easier to prosecute former presidents after they leave office if they are accused of criminal activity. New York senator Michael Gianaris and assemblyman Nick Perry, who proposed the bill, said it was aimed at making sure presidents could be held to account "Like every other New York citizen", according to the New York Post. "Clearly the privileges of the Office of president were not intended to make the holder of the office above the law, and was not intended to empower a president with the ability to thwart and sabotage an active, legitimate investigation as New York prosecutors have accused the president of doing," Mr Perry said.

> How about we make it easier to prosecute Presidents for crimes they commit, period?

> If you’re using the presidency as a legal shield then you should be impeached.

## Trump’s Shredding of Civil Liberties Won’t Stop With Antifa: An American was killed by federal agents and the president called it “retribution.” We are so far gone.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/opinion/trump-antifa-civil-liberties.html):

> Reinoehl, a self-described antifa supporter, was a suspect in the shooting of Aaron J. Danielson, a backer of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, during an August street confrontation in Portland, Ore. The Olympian newspaper quoted two witnesses who said Reinoehl fired at the police, but one later said his remarks had been misconstrued and he wasn't sure if Reinoehl had a weapon. Trump has repeatedly sent American law enforcement the message that members of antifa are terrorists who should be treated with extreme violence, and that protests against racial injustice and his administration are dominated by antifa.

`/u/Custergrant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/isxsad/trumps_shredding_of_civil_liberties_wont_stop/):

> Meanwhile, the conservatives on my social media are pretty much lusting after harming rioters and liberals.
