We've won in court to ensure people can vote by mail-in ballot safely and securely. Trump keeps trying to sow doubt in our elections and disenfranchise voters, and I'm fighting him every step of the way to make sure your vote is counted.

> I've been telling myself "This is not normal" for four years while my older siblings, parents and some aunts and uncles have become angry and paranoid pricks. They have become satisfied with a lower quality of life and are willing to settle for a complete dictatorship based on what Trump tells them is good for them.

> >“The working group came to the reluctant conclusion that Attorney General Barr is using the powers of the Department as a vehicle for supporting the political objectives of President Donald Trump,” they wrote. “It appears that the Department has transitioned from one that is subject to law, to become one that instead views the application of law as politically discretionary; moving from rule of law to rule by law.”

> >...  
> >  
> >They focused on areas in which Barr’s conduct sparked widespread criticism, including the way in which they said he “intentionally mischaracterized” Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report when he presented it to the American public. They looked at Barr’s assignment of several U.S. attorneys, including Durham, to conduct counter-investigations that the report says are “designed to discredit” the Russia probe and the Mueller Report.

## If Trump is so tough on terrorism, why did the Taliban just endorse him?

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/12/if-trump-is-so-tough-terrorism-why-did-taliban-just-endorse-him/):

> Trump inherited the anti-Islamic-State effort from Obama; by the time Trump took office, the Islamic State had already lost half of its caliphate. "We hope he will win the election and wind up the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan," a senior Taliban leader told CBS News.That the Taliban is endorsing Trump shows the falsity of his boasts to be a tough-on-terrorism president. Trump called Black Lives Matter protesters "Anarchists & Agitators," and Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly killed two during a protest in Kenosha, Wis. Trump tweeted "LIBERATE MICHIGAN," and six men were arrested last week for allegedly planning to kidnap the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer.

> Because a tough talking idiot is better than a person that is quietly effective? Trump's style effectively stymies any (remaining) allies or coalition building efforts.
