Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kmuant/rpolitics_is_looking_for_more_moderators/):

> We have always had a link in our sidebar where users can apply to be a moderator, but the truth is we don't get many applications at all, so we have decided to reach out to users on a larger scale. Who are we looking for? We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes.

## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 12

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/masef4/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Here in Massachusetts, Phase 2 Group 3 vaccination signups are now available. That's people 60+ and people who work in certain front line jobs. In 2 weeks it goes to Phase 2 Group 4 (55+, single comorbidity), and Phase 3 (Everyone) 2 weeks after that.

> I remember a year ago when the Boston subreddit was abuzz with pictures of roving wild turkeys, and while those posts were great I cannot wait for a sense of old normalcy again.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-education-fbf6fcb8ca51ab5b4b45b5318046e831):

> WASHINGTON - Fresh off passage of the COVID-19 relief bill, President Joe Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a sweeping $3 trillion package of investments on infrastructure and domestic needs. Biden huddled privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden's "Build Back Better" campaign promise. Biden is expected to roll out his budget in the weeks ahead as Congress presses forward on the infrastructure package, which lawmakers have said could be ready by summer.

> We’ve needed serious infrastructure repair and replacement for decades. But still, not only will exactly zero Republican senators vote for it, they will focus their efforts on obstruction.
