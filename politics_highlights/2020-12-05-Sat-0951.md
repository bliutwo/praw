## Faith shaken in system, Trump’s Georgia supporters consider skipping U.S. Senate runoffs

> A tide of GOP figures, national and local, are urging conservative voters to ignore the pleas from former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who told a crowd of more than 1,000 Republicans at an Alpharetta park this week to boycott the vote until Georgia ditches newly purchased voting machines - a system approved by GOP legislators. That's not lost on senior Georgia Republican officials, who are urgently pleading with voters to focus ahead on the runoffs rather than backward at Trump's November defeat. Still, she said, the talk of voting fraud she's heard over the years has shaken her faith in the election system.

## Trump sued by N.Y. apartment tenants alleging years-old rent scheme

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-tenants-lawsuit/2020/12/04/db4a82e6-367a-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html):

> NEW YORK - President Trump, already saddled with lawsuits and investigations that will follow him when he leaves office, is now facing a legal challenge from former tenants who say he and his family manipulated the cost of apartment improvements to raise their rents. The group of tenants from rent-regulated apartments that late family patriarch Fred C. Trump once owned are pursuing a class-action lawsuit, alleging a long-running scheme in which a Trump-controlled company, All County Building Supply, artificially adjusted the cost of appliances and other materials to justify raising rents at more than 30 buildings previously owned and managed by the Trumps in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Manhattan's district attorney and New York state's attorney general both have active investigations into Trump and the Trump Organization.

## AOC attacked Trump and Republicans on Twitter over rising college costs, arguing that many lawmakers didn't understand students' financial struggles

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-attacks-trump-republicans-over-college-costs-students-financial-struggles-2020-12):

> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez late Friday shot back at President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, accusing them of being so out of touch with young American workers that they remember when Hershey bars were "5¢ at the general store." The congresswoman's posts were the latest in a back-and-forth with conservatives about how difficult it's become for young Americans to pay for college while minimum wages remain stagnant. "These Republicans who are defensively rage-tweeting"But you're wrong! I worked my way to pay through college!!" don't realize they sound like folks who speak of the days when Hershey bars were 5¢ at the general store," the congresswoman said on Twitter.

`/u/well_uh_yeah` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k75dfz/aoc_attacked_trump_and_republicans_on_twitter/):

> I can't imagine having the levels of student loans that I read about.  It must just be absolutely soul crushing.  I was truly blessed to not have to take out any loans.  If my first couple hundred every month was going to pay for college, years after college, I would not be a happy camper.  Wouldn't the economy (which is all some people care about) be better off with consumers having that money to consume with?

> Wisconsin Supreme Court rejects move to nullify election; federal judge calls idea 'bizarre'. In a pair of stinging rebukes, one from a conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice and the other from a federal judge President Donald Trump appointed, two courts Friday balked at efforts by Trump and his supporters to toss out the results of the presidential election in the state and have the Legislature decide the winner. In the state Supreme Court case, a conservative nonprofit, the Wisconsin Voters Alliance, had asked the court to invalidate the election and have the Legislature pick new Electoral College electors.
