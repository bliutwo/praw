## Reagan Foundation asks Trump campaign, RNC to stop using former president's name to raise money: report

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/509049-ronald-reagan-foundation-asks-trump-campaign-rnc-to-stop-using-former):

> The Presidential Foundation and Institute called on the 's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee to stop using former President Reagan's name and image to fundraise last week. Reagan Foundation Chief Marketing Officer Melissa Giller told the Post that the RNC agreed "Within seconds" to stop using the former president to fundraise for Trump's reelection bid. "Given that the Reagan Foundation just recently hosted the Trump family to raise money for its organization and has not objected to us using President Reagan's likeness before, their objection came as a surprise. Even though we believe our use of the image was appropriate, we will stop emailing this fundraising solicitation as a courtesy," Ahrens continued.

## Republicans Are Finally Turning Against Trump. Too Little, Too Late.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-are-finally-turning-against-trump-too-little-too-late):

> It is now clear that Trump is running against the wind. Like several Republican governors cited by the Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is also separating from Trump on the issue of wearing masks, as well as on Anthony Fauci, in whom McConnell says he has "Total" confidence. On one hand, it is fair to say that these Republicans have enabled Trump's despicable behavior, while doing nothing to mitigate his worst instincts.

`/u/immaterialist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hxwuqb/republicans_are_finally_turning_against_trump_too/):

> Last line of the article:
> 
> > And when President Biden is trying to raise the top marginal tax rate north of 50 percent, I want enough Republicans in the Senate to be there to stop it.
> 
> Yeah, that’s a no for me, dawg. The ultra-rich can get fucked and this writer can get fucked. The GOP needs to be vivisected and scattered to the wind. Whatever takes its place will know what happens to parties that commit to a core platform of treason.

## Republicans say they’re for small, local government. Apparently not in Portland.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/25/portland-trump-republicans-federalism/):

> Apparently the Trump administration now has no such faith in local expertise when it comes to mayors and police departments it thinks aren't cracking down hard enough on protesters, undocumented immigrants or whoever the boogeyman of the week is. Admittedly, the push and pull between the states and the federal government is complicated, and sometimes federalism's two-way street turns into one of those confusing European roundabouts: Is overriding a mask mandate freeing residents from oppressive local government, or is it thwarting the mandate of duly elected local leaders? Is it consistent to applaud a sheriff for ignoring a governor's order in one state while lauding a governor in another state for suing cities that ignore his order? Even if Democrats, in this case, don't suffer from the same ideological inconsistencies, some have shown a different kind of hypocrisy: After going to the site of protests, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler coughed and gagged after being tear-gassed by federal officers, telling reporters that it was an "Egregious overreaction," even as protesters reminded him that the Portland Police Bureau, under his direct control, had been using the same tactics on them for weeks, without a peep from some of the same Oregon Democrats now denouncing the federal deployment.

`/u/Vanillas_Guy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hxu36q/republicans_say_theyre_for_small_local_government/):

> "Small government" is essentially "I dont want to pay more tax. And I ESPECIALLY dont want to pay more taxes if it means that people I have a bias against will get any of the same government benefits I'd be entitled to"
