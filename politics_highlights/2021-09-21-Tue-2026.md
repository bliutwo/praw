## The Trump Campaign Knew the Dominion Voting Machine Stuff Was Nonsense When They Started With It A newly uncovered internal memo closes the case on the big scam.

Summary of [original article](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a37682008/trump-campaign-dominion-voting-machines-knew-baseless/):

> By the time the news conference occurred on Nov. 19, Mr. Trump's campaign had already prepared an internal memo on many of the outlandish claims about the company, Dominion Voting Systems, and the separate software company, Smartmatic. The court papers, which were initially filed late last week as a motion in a defamation lawsuit brought against the campaign and others by a former Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, contain evidence that officials in the Trump campaign were aware early on that many of the claims against the companies were baseless. The documents also suggest that the campaign sat on its findings about Dominion even as Sidney Powell and other lawyers attacked the company in the conservative media and ultimately filed four federal lawsuits accusing it of a vast conspiracy to rig the election against Mr. TrumpAs Mr. Coomer's lawyers wrote in their motion in the defamation suit, "The memo produced by the Trump campaign shows that, at least internally, the Trump campaign found there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories regarding Dominion" and Mr. Coomer.

> This memo isnt any sort of seditious smoking gun? For the lawyer at least? Seems like someone who seeks to overturn an election should at least be disbarred.

## “We Need to Deliver”: Anger Grows at Sens. Manchin, Sinema over Obstruction of Democratic Priorities

Summary of [original article](https://www.democracynow.org/2021/9/21/35_trillion_spending_bill_ro_khanna):

> Two conservative Democratic senators - Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia - have balked at the three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar price tag. The question is: Are they going to engage in that dialogue? We still haven't heard what Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema are for. Your message to Manchin and Sinema right now, and also the issue of who they're beholden to - for example, the well-known ties of Senator Manchin to the oil, gas and coal industry - and how that can play into his opposing a three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar deal which is about the greening of America?

`/u/Gardening_Socialist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/psk7im/we_need_to_deliver_anger_grows_at_sens_manchin/):

> Their whole objection seems to amount to, “this bill might accidentally help too many people.”

## Boris Johnson says dealing with Joe Biden is ‘a breath of fresh air’

Summary of [original article](https://www.today.com/news/politics/boris-johnson-says-dealing-joe-biden-breath-fresh-air-rcna2122?cid=sm_npd_td_fb_ma&fbclid=IwAR3FwkfeMZkO-9jeXRvWLzP2ldFAxhJC7CdJlN8o_9ph0q6z-wyyO6pVVTE):

> British prime minister Boris Johnson says working with President Joe Biden has been "a breath of fresh air" compared to the previous administration when it comes to one issue in particular. Asked about his close relationship with former President Donald Trump, Johnson said the U.K. prime minister and U.S. president are "Fated to get along," which applies to Trump and now Biden. "But what I will say about Joe Biden and dealing with the new American president, yes, it is a breath of fresh air in the sense of the some things on which we can really really work together, and you knew I was gonna bring it up - climate change - he's great on that," Johnson said.

> Boris Johnson is an idiot and extremely conservative and even he acknowledges the existential threat of climate change.  Fuck the GOP
