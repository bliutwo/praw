## USPS fans are loving a (very unofficial) poster that adds 'fascism' to the challenges that can't stop the postal service

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-poster-fascism-rain-snow-mail-2020-8):

> As far as government agencies go, the United States Postal Service boasts quite the creed: "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds." But in these unusual times, with the mail service at the center of a political maelstrom, weather can seem a paltry concern. She created a new poster supporting the USPS, which adds fascism to the list of challenges that won't deter the postal service. Once the poster began circulating, Leigh-Winters said that she uploaded the design to printing services like RedBubble, where people can order merchandise with it.

## "He needs to cheat to win": Dems condemn Trump's USPS attacks

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/democrats-trump-usps-attack-a4a197aa-10a0-4b3e-85e6-95ce570bb066.html):

> Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump on Friday of using "Sabotage tactics" in his latest attacks on the U.S. Postal Service and mail-in voting, and threatening the integrity of the 2020 election, they wrote in a letter. The big picture: Trump this week vowed to block additional funding for the USPS in the next coronavirus stimulus package, linking the agency to his baseless claims that increased mail-in voting will lead to widespread voter fraud. "House and Senate Democrats call on the President to immediately cease his assault on the Postal Service, make clear that he will allow the 2020 election to proceed without his sabotage tactics and enable the American people the same opportunity he and the First Lady requested this week to vote by absentee ballot," Pelosi and Schumer write.

> His voters and supporters will just claim mail in voting is cheating. 
> 
> It’s a no-win scenario. I’ve had die hard supporters argue on end, get proved wrong them scream “I don’t care! He’s still my president!” then continue with the lies. 
> 
> It’s truly a cult.
