## Trump allies shouldn't be sworn into office until cleared of their own claims of election fraud: Voter fraud allegations by Republicans elected to state office mean that their own elections would be illegitimate, too.

Summary of [original article](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-allies-shouldn-t-be-sworn-office-until-cleared-their-n1252676):

> Here's the bigger question: How can any congressional Republican-elect who claims there was fraud or other voter irregularities in their own states be sworn into the new Congress when it commences on Jan. 3? After all, they are telling us that their own election is likely illegitimate. The evidence of election fraud on the part of the GOP candidate who had purportedly won, Mark Harris, was so rampant that the North Carolina election board refused to certify the results. This congressional seat remained open as an investigation was conducted over the next two months that led to even Republican Harris conceding - after a hearing in February - that there had indeed been election fraud by a GOP operative who was later charged with election related crimes.

> no no no see this is all wrong yea? see, those elections were legit. those votes they received, all legit. it was only the presidential election that they claim was fraud and rigged, not their own local election.
> 
> never mind the fact they were all on the same ballot - we are supposed to believe that there are millions and millions of ballots that just have 1 vote cast to the presidential race......

## Florida Rep. wants Mar-a-Lago shut down or fined following NYE party

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/florida-rep-mar-lago-shut-fined-nye-party-1558551):

> A Florida state representative is urging officials to shut down or fine Mar-a-Lago after a New Year's Eve party at President Donald Trump's private Palm Beach club when footage suggests attendees violated coronavirus rules. It prompted State Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat representing West Palm Beach, to tweet on Friday: "Mar-a-Lago is a club. A club is a business. Businesses must abide by Palm Beach County's mask order, or be fined or even shut down. We knew that Trump was hosting a New Year's party." Hardy then asked Bonlarron if any action would be taken against Ma-a-Lago in relation to the mask order and whether officials would seek to shut down the club, should it be found that the mandate has been "Consistently flouted" there.

> Please do.  Getting pretty sick of these idiots acting like the pandemic is over.  While they super spread and cause unnecessary deaths.

## Don't act surprised: Donald Trump was never going to accept the election results if he lost. Trump has no credibility when he claims the election was stolen — because he always accuses opponents of cheating

> Cheaters think everyone else is cheating.  Therefore their cheating is normal. That justifies their behavior in their minds. So, this isn't surprising.

## Fauci blasts Trump’s baseless tweets accusing CDC of exaggerating Covid death toll: ‘These are real people’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fauci-covid-deaths-cdc-b1781698.html):

> Mr Trump tweeted that Dr Fauci "Works for me and the Trump Administration, and I am in no way given any credit for my work". The first signs of disagreement came in February, when Mr Trump suggested the virus would go away with the arrival of warmer weather and was contradicted by Dr Fauci. Mr Trump has repeatedly contradicted Dr Fauci on Twitter throughout the pandemic.

`/u/Pub_Fighter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kplkfh/fauci_blasts_trumps_baseless_tweets_accusing_cdc/):

> It’s probably undercounted. Trump should be forced to see people die in hospitals.

## NBC's Chuck Todd to GOP senator on Electoral College challenge: 'You're the arsonist here'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/532410-chuck-todd-rips-ron-johnson-over-voter-fraud-claims-youre-the-arsonist-here):

> Of NBC's "Meet the Press" sharply criticized Sen. during a Sunday interview over the Wisconsin Republican's decision to join other GOP senators in challenging the presidential election in several states, saying, "You're the arsonist here." Johnson is the only GOP senator to announce a challenge of the election results who represents a state Biden won. "So, essentially, you're the arsonist here," Todd said, adding that Johnson did not "Have the guts to tell the truth admit that this election was fair."

`/u/goldbricker83` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kpmg0g/nbcs_chuck_todd_to_gop_senator_on_electoral/):

> His only rationale he could give for supporting this was “tens of millions of people believe it.” Todd pretty effectively stood up to that with “millions believe 9/11 was an inside job or the moon landing was a hoax, why didn’t you investigate that?”
> 
> Seriously, enough is enough. The harm this is doing to American politics should have ended when the courts threw it out.
