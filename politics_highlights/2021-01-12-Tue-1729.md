## US military ‘issues rare statement denouncing Capitol riot and confirming Biden as next commander-in-chief’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/us-military-biden-trump-capitol-riot-jcs-b1786319.html):

> America's military leadership is said to have issued a rare statement denouncing the Capitol riot and confirming Joe Biden as the next commander-in-chief. "As service members, we must embody the values and ideals of the nation," said the statement reputedly issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Amid intense anxiety ahead of next weeks' inauguration and fears of a repeat of the violence and chaos that reverberated across the world, reports said the uniformed leadership felt obliged to issue the statement and comment on live events, something it seeks to avoid doing.

> It cannot be overstated how much of a “holy shit” it is that the armed forces released a statement confirming the victor of an election.

## McConnell is said to be pleased about impeachment, believing it will make it easier to purge Trump from the Republican Party

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/mcconnell-impeachment-trump-mc.html):

> While Mr. McCarthy has said he is personally opposed to impeachment, he and other party leaders have decided not to formally lobby Republicans to vote "No," and an aide to Mr. McCarthy said he was open to a measure censuring Mr. Trump for his conduct. Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky has indicated he wants to see the specific article of impeachment that the House is set to approve on Wednesday, which is expected to draw support from as many as a dozen Republicans, potentially including Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the party's No. 3 in the House. In the days since the attack, Mr. McCarthy has veered from asking Republican colleagues if he should call on Mr. Trump to resign to privately floating impeachment to his current posture, opposed to impeachment but open to a censure.
