## AOC rips Texas governor for blaming outages on Green New Deal | Ms Ocasio-Cortez points to Gregg Abbott’s own failures and apparent lack of knowledge of his state’s energy supply as reasons for outages

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/aoc-texas-winter-storm-green-new-deal-b1803840.html):

> The governor referred to the Green New Deal, a set of policy proposals intended to help tackle the climate crisis that has not become law, nor been implemented, as a "Deadly deal" during an appearance on Fox News. "This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America," Mr Abbott told Sean Hannity. Former congresswoman Katie Hill noted on Twitter: "Very on-brand for republicans to blame power outages in a state that they run entirely on the Green New Deal proposed by democrats that hasn't even been voted on yet let alone taken effect."

`/u/theladynora` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lm79ng/aoc_rips_texas_governor_for_blaming_outages_on/):

> "Gov. Abbott doesn’t seem to have a grasp on his state, so here’s a reminder: Texas runs 80-90% on fossil fuels. "
> 
>  The biggest issue appears to be a failure to weatherproof systems to withstand extreme cold.

## Texas spent more time fighting LGBTQ civil rights than fixing their power grid. How’d that work out? It wasn't Chick-fil-A that needed to be "saved."

> 
> Conservatives when something bad happens to them: God is punishing us for not being cruel enough to gay people.
> 
> Edit: For those saying I'm painting with too wide a brush, I'm specifically talkings about conservative politicians in places like Texas, who are corrupt, pseudoreligious asshats who spend all their time talking about cultural non-issues like gay marriage and abortion so they can distract from the fact that they're letting their rich idiot friends create and maintain the state's failing infrastructure.

## Millions of Texans Are Freezing Right Now — Our Deregulated Electrical Grid Is to Blame

Summary of [original article](https://jacobinmag.com/2021/02/texas-power-electricity-grid-weather-winter-storm):

> Most of the missing power capacity, according to a director of the Texas grid operator, actually comes from traditional thermal generation. Fossil fuel generation comprises the majority of the lost generation in the Texas grid, but is it really so comforting to renewables advocates that wind power is performing poorly in this time of need but more expectedly so than fossil fuels? And still worse than what the grid was relying on it for? If there's not enough supply to meet demand at any point in time - a particularly hot summer day with millions of air conditioners humming away - the grid operator has to cut power to whole swathes of the Texan population in the form of blackouts, which is what's happening in Texas right now.
