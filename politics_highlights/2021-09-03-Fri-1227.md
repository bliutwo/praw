## Updates to Our Rule Against Harm

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pemm7d/updates_to_our_rule_against_harm/):

> We have recently updated our rule against harm which we believe will help users better understand how we have enforced this rule. Politics is a messy and controversial subject, but that does not mean it is acceptable to cheer on harm against people you disagree with. We have specifically chosen to include this language as part of our harm rule to limit its scope.

## The Time for Democrats to Go Nuclear Was Yesterday

Summary of [original article](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/sb8-texas-abortion-democrats-filibuster-manchin-voting-rights.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&utm_medium=social_acct&utm_campaign=feed-part):

> In the U.S., constitutional law guarantees pregnant people the right to have an abortion without "Interference from the state." Judicial precedent also empowers Americans to preempt any state law that flagrantly violates their constitutional rights: Even before an illicit statute takes effect, individuals can seek a court order barring state officers from enforcing it. The Texas GOP passed a law that effectively bans abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy - before many women even realize they are pregnant - but outsourced enforcement of this ban to private citizens. Unlike Texas's abortion ban, none of these measures would contravene constitutional law.

> >One party is so committed to its ideological objectives that it is willing to violate the Constitution to achieve them. The other is so ambivalent about its own goals that it fetishizes procedural obstacles to their enactment.

## Release: Reps. Khanna, Beyer, Lee, Tlaib Introduce Legislation to Set Supreme Court Term Limits, Appointments Schedule, Without Constitutional Amendment

Summary of [original article](https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-khanna-beyer-lee-tlaib-introduce-legislation-set-supreme-court):

> Ro Khanna and Don Beyer along with Barbara Lee and Rashida Tlaib reintroduced the Supreme Court Term Limits Act to fundamentally reframe the power of our nation's highest court. "Like recent bids to livestream Supreme Court arguments and modernize the judicial ethics laws, the Khanna legislation would bring an overdue infusion of democracy to the most powerful, least accountable branch and insert guardrails that are perfectly consistent with Congress' constitutional authority over the court's structure and function. I want to thank Rep. Khanna not only for speaking out about the need to end the arbitrary, antediluvian method of appointing our justices but for also doing something about it." This is the first bill to propose Supreme Court term limits as opposed to a constitutional amendment, meaning the legislation can pass with simple majorities in the House and Senate, rather than waiting through the long amendment process with the higher two-thirds vote threshold.

`/u/sledgehomer` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ph7uys/release_reps_khanna_beyer_lee_tlaib_introduce/):

> Everyone should have term limits. It's an abuse of power otherwise. George Washington knew that

## If Texas leaders want to protect life, where are masks, vaccines, resources for kids?

`/u/bandit69` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ph4ir6/if_texas_leaders_want_to_protect_life_where_are/):

> Texas officials don't give a flying fuck about the sanctity of life. The only reason they're so anti-abortion is the hope to win the vote of the religious right.
> 
> Once the kid is born, it is left on it's own. They've shown that they don't really care how many people die from the cold, the heat, Covid or other reasons.
> 
> I wonder what the state of the foster care system is in Texas.
