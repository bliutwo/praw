## Oregon Rep. Pleads Guilty to Allowing Violent Protesters Into State Capitol Through Backdoor

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/former-state-rep-mike-nearman-pleads-guilty-banned-from-oregon-capitol-for-18-months?ref=home?ref=home):

> Former Oregon state Rep. Mike Nearman has been banned from entering the Oregon Capitol building and its surrounds for the next 18 months after pleading guilty Tuesday to official misconduct. Last December, when the Capitol was closed due to the pandemic, Nearman opened a side door to allow a group of violent protestors inside. Nearman said he wanted to go to trial but pleaded guilty to avoid mounting legal bills.

## Police officer responds to GOP claims that Capitol rioters were tourists: 'If that's what American tourists are like, I can see why foreign countries don't like American tourists'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-daniel-hodges-responds-republican-claim-insurrectionists-tourists-2021-7):

> "Some of our colleagues have been calling the violent insurrectionists not terrorists, but tourists," said Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, referring to Republican Rep. Andrew Clyde's earlier claim on the matter. "Well, if that's what American tourists are like, I can see why foreign countries don't like American tourists," MPD officer Daniel Hodges deadpanned, as lawmakers and the audience broke into laughter. Hodges referred to the insurrectionists who overran the Capitol as "Terrorists" multiple times on Tuesday, as he and three other witnesses testified before a special committee Congress set up to investigate the January 6 siege.

> And then he was all like 'no seriously' and whipped out the criminal definition  of Domestic Terrorist and read it aloud. . . Like a boss

## What did Jim Jordan know about the insurrection and when did he know it? |

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/27/jim-jordan-republican-capitol-attack-insurrection-house-select-committee):

> One of the abused wrestlers, Mark Coleman, who was a close friend and roommate of Jordan and became an Ultimate Fighting Champion, told the Wall Street Journal: "There's no way unless he's got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State." Another abused wrestler, Dunyasha Yetts, said: "If Jordan says he didn't know about it then he's lying." Jordan refused to cooperate with the university's investigation: goodbye, Columbus. What does Jordan know about the creation of the "Stop the steal" myth? Were his statements about a fraudulent election and attacking the Pennsylvania supreme court for its role in "Stealing the election" made in coordination with anyone at the White House or known to them in advance? If he got marching orders, where did he get them from?2) Two days after the election, Jordan was a speaker of a "Stop the Steal" rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, before the state capitol. What does Jordan know about Raga's involvement? Did Jordan speak with any donors or groups about funding or participating in the events of 6 January? Did anyone ask him to raise money or speak with anyone organizing for 6 January?

## Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz Get Heckled off the Stage While Defending Capitol Rioters

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-press-conference-protesters-1202980/):

> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has made a career out of publicly harassing her imagined enemies. "A maskless Marjorie Taylor Greene & her staff berated me in a hallway," Bush wrote. After the press conference to defend the Capitol rioters was shut down, Greene was whisked down the sidewalk, trailed by protesters shouting at her.

`/u/fungobat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/osyp7o/watch_marjorie_taylor_greene_and_matt_gaetz_get/):

> "Itâ€™s fitting that the press conference was called off while Greene was speaking. The conspiracy theorist has a long history of aggressively trolling those with whom she disagrees. In 2019, she followed Parkland High School shooting survivor David Hogg in Washington, D.C., verbally harassing him about his support of gun control. It took Greene until early this year to admit the Parkland shooting actually happened, after previously having claimed it was staged."
