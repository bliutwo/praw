> Yeah, now it’s over.  The question is whether Cuomo decides to go quietly on his own or make the New York Legislature impeach him.  Also that throws something of a wrench in the 2022 campaign…

## Trump Reacts to Latest Tax Returns Ruling Like a Man Who Has Committed All Manner of Fraud | It sure sounds like the ex-president has a whole bunch of stuff to hide.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/08/donald-trump-tax-returns-doj-ruling):

> One hundred million years ago, when Donald Trump was running for president, he claimed that the reason he was breaking with the decades-long tradition in which White House hopefuls voluntarily released their tax returns was that he was under audit but would get them to the public ASAP. Obviously, like so many things out of Trump's mouth, both the excuse and the promise were lies: According to experts, an audit does not preclude someone from making their tax returns public and Trump went four years without ever coughing up anything. Why was Trump so loathe to share his tax documents? While we would never dare think it, others assumed that it was because he had something-for instance, possible tax evasion, fraud, connection to Russian oligarchs, etc. While Team Trump is no doubt terrified at the prospect of congressional investigators getting their hands on Trump's tax returns, it's likely also feeling out of sorts given that the decision from Biden's DOJ is a reversal from the one run by William Barr, which claimed the Treasury, then being led by Trump footstool Steven Mnuchin, was justified in refusing to hand the documents over to Congress.

## Reps. Cori Bush and AOC declare victory as Biden agrees to extend the eviction moratorium

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/news/1003331/reps-cori-bush-and-aoc-declare-victory-as-biden-agrees-to-extend-the-eviction):

> President Biden is set to issue a limited extension on the federal eviction moratorium - and progressive lawmakers couldn't be more pleased. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrated the news on Tuesday, applauding the Biden administration's decision to extend a moratorium that expired Saturday, renewing it in places with high transmission of COVID-19, reports The Hill. While discussing the limited extension, Biden foreshadowed exactly that kind of game plan, saying he doesn't know if a new moratorium will "Pass constitutional muster," but expects it will buy more time for rent relief to get out while it's litigated, reports Marketplace.

`/u/Nick__________` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oxgsei/reps_cori_bush_and_aoc_declare_victory_as_biden/):

> Cori Bush deserves massive credit for this without her protesting on the steps of Congress many people would be facing evictions during a pandemic right now.
