> > House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Thursday released a memo arguing that House Democrats' subpoena for President Trump's financial records already meets the requirements set out by the Supreme Court for Congress to obtain those documents.

## Biden: I condemn violence in Portland, 'challenge Trump to do the same'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/514347-biden-i-condemn-violence-in-portland-challenge-trump-to-do-the-same):

> "I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same," Biden said in a statement Sunday. "Donald Trump has been president for almost four years. The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because Donald Trump can't do the job of the American president," Biden said. The Democrats' accusations came after clashes between Black Lives Matter protesters and Trump supporters erupted in wake of the fatal shooting in Portland as well as the fatal shooting of two protesters last week in Kenosha, Wisc.

> > "He may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong – but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is. He may think that war in our streets is good for his reelection chances, but that is not presidential leadership – or even basic human compassion.

## White Supremacists Are Invading American Cities To Incite a Civil War

Summary of [original article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/30/white-supremacists-are-invading-american-cities-to-incite-a-civil-war/):

> In his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, Barack Obama said: "There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America." If it was true then, it certainly isn't true now. We are a nation on the edge of an increasingly hot civil war, one in which white supremacists are invading American cities, fomenting violence, and the overtly racist president they support sees the violence as benefiting him politically. All of this is happening because white supremacists are invading American cities with the express intent of starting a civil war.

`/u/Sagebrush-1138` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ijjqxw/white_supremacists_are_invading_american_cities/):

> Don't these people realize Trump **HATES** them?
> 
> To Trump, they and their "mega-patriot" families are poor, filthy expendables.

## Trump offered FBI director job to John Kelly, asked for loyalty

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/trump-john-kelly-fbi-41678290-167a-44c2-a20a-377955485bc8.html):

> The day after President Trump fired FBI boss James Comey, the president phoned John Kelly, who was then secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, and offered him Comey's job, the New York Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Michael Schmidt reports in his forthcoming book, "Donald Trump v. The United States." Behind the scenes: Schmidt reports that "Throughout Kelly's time working directly with Trump, Kelly was repeatedly struck by how Trump failed to understand how those who worked for him - like Kelly and other top former generals - had interest in being loyal not to him, but to the institutions of American democracy." In a summary of the reporting, Schmidt tells me, "This was a highly invasive tactic. Mueller's team wanted to know whether Trump had a role in the firing of the acting FBI director Andrew McCabe and whether Trump was saying anything about prosecuting Comey."
