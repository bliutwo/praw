> The news media needs to stop calling it a payroll tax "holiday". It isn't a holiday. It is a deferment. Yes. The President has the ability to instruct the IRS to defer tax payments for up to a year but that doesn't mean the bill disappears. It is **deferred**. The President does not have the ability to unilaterally forgive taxes. Only Congress does.
> 
> No business in their right mind would **ever** take that gamble and actually defer those taxes. If they aren't forgiven they will not only be on the hook for their 7.65% they owe but also the 7.65% they failed to withhold from their employees. So the business would owe the IRS 15.3% of their entire operating payroll for six months. Any company would be out of their mind to do that and risk further financial ruin on the promise that it *may* be forgiven at a later date.
> 
> Not to mention that a payroll tax cut is a backdoor method of cutting social security and medicare. So sticking it to the old people...again.

## Rep. Peter DeFazio Leads Effort to Save the Postal Service

> As a fellow Oregonian I am right behind De Fazio in those efforts.  The postal system is a constitutionally authorized institution and it has been under attack for a few years by the rightwing, and I really don't know why.  Up until very recently it has been an efficient and vital member of society that serves a valuable purpose.

## The White House reportedly asked South Dakota's governor how to add another president to Mount Rushmore, and she later gave Trump a 4-foot replica with his face on it

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gov-noem-trumps-desire-carved-into-mt-rushmore-2020-8):

> Last year, a White House aide contacted the office of South Dakota's governor, Republican Kristi Noem, to inquire about the process for adding more faces, according to The New York Times. When Trump visited the monument in early July for an Independence Day speech, she greeted him with a four-foot model of Mount Rushmore with his face carved into it, the Times reported, citing a source familiar with the exchange. To be clear, adding another face to Mount Rushmore is not possible.

## Michigan county official resigns after doubling down on N-word, says he's not racist

Summary of [original article](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/08/07/michigan-county-official-defends-using-n-word/112899250/):

> Traverse City - An elected official in a mostly white county in northern Michigan who used a racist slur prior to a public meeting to describe Black people in Detroit will resign, the county administrator said Friday. Leelanau County Administrator Chet Janik said Tom Eckerle, a member of the county road commission, would step down after receiving criticism from across the U.S. for his comments. Eckerle, a farmer, was elected to a six-year term on the Leelanau County Road Commission in 2018.

> >The newspaper quoted Eckerle, a Republican, as saying, "Well, this whole thing is because of them n-----s in Detroit ... I can say anything that I want. Black Lives Matter has everything to do with taking the country away from us."
> 
> Sounds like your average GOP member
