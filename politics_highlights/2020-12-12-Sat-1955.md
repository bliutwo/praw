## Republican legislators are refusing to pay two Wisconsin counties the $3 million they're owed for conducting election recounts

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/wisconsin-counties-stiffed-3-million-for-conducting-election-recounts-2020-12):

> Two Wisconsin counties are being denied the money they're owed for conducting election vote recounts, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The Trump 2020 campaign paid a total of $3 million to Dane and Milwaukee counties after demanding recounts there. The Trump campaign already paid the $3 million recount fee, but the state's legislature's budget committee, which has a Republican majority, is withholding it.

## Ivanka Trump Has Been Grifting Her Way Through Her Father's Presidency. But It's Hunter Biden We Want to Investigate?

Summary of [original article](https://www.vogue.com/article/hunter-biden-ivanka-trump-who-should-we-investigate):

> Is Hunter Biden the presidential offspring we really need to worry about? How about those two grifters-in-chief, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner? Hunter Biden is no Boy Scout; that's been well-documented. This week, Ivanka sat for a five-hour deposition with the Washington, D.C., Attorney General's Office as part of an ongoing investigation into spending by the Trump 2017 Inaugural Committee. One issue is whether the Trump family, including Ivanka, gouged the Inaugural Committee by substantially overcharging them for use of the Trump Hotel in Washington.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/donald-trump-worst-president-fox-poll-b1770950.html):

> Almost half of US voters think Donald Trump will go down as one of the worst American presidents in history, according to a poll by Fox News. Some 52 per cent of people questioned disapprove of the job that Mr Trump has done, and 55 per cent think that the country is worse off today than it was four years ago, and the same number disapproved of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Some 58 per cent of respondents don't think the election was stolen and 56 per cent said Mr Trump's repeated claims that there had been electoral fraud, without providing evidence, had weakened democracy.

## Bernie Sanders: ‘Democracy Has Gotten a Reprieve With Biden’s Victory. That’s All It Is.’

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/sanders-trump-election-festival/):

> Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders joined the first-ever Nation Festival in mid-November, along with Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir of Iceland, author Naomi Klein, Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza, and more than a dozen other national and international leaders. JN: You've always recognized structural insufficiencies in democracy. Democracy has gotten a reprieve with Biden's victory.

`/u/Dawg1001` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kbvbe9/bernie_sanders_democracy_has_gotten_a_reprieve/):

> We need to ditch the electoral college. We can't have the same few states deciding the presidential election every time.  One person = one vote.  With a 7 million popular vote margin in 2020 - there is no way this election could have been challenged.  And Trump would have lost in 2016, which would have been better for the country given Trump's catastrophic response to the COVID pandemic.

## Imploding MAGA World Turns to Civil War Fantasies, Secession After Supreme Court Disaster

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/imploding-maga-world-turns-to-civil-war-secession-after-supreme-court-disaster?ref=wrap):

> MAGA world has gone into total meltdown after the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a bizarre Trump-endorsed lawsuit on Friday seeking to overturn the results of the presidential election. "If the Supreme Court can't save our republic, then where is the military?" former Fox News pundits and unofficial Trump "Advisers" Diamond & Silk tweeted Friday evening. The Supreme Court case, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against four swing states that President-elect Joe Biden won, was always going to be a long shot.

`/u/cknight13` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kbthlb/imploding_maga_world_turns_to_civil_war_fantasies/):

> They should just give up on the democratic process and never vote again in protest.
