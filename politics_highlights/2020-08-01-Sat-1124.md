## Alexander Vindman: Coming forward ended my career. I still believe doing what’s right matters.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/01/alexander-vindman-retiring-oped/):

> Alexander Vindman, a career U.S. Army officer, served on the National Security Council as the director for Eastern European, Caucasus and Russian affairs, as the Russia political-military affairs officer for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as a military attaché in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. At no point in my career or life have I felt our nation's values under greater threat and in more peril than at this moment. I want to help ensure that right matters for all Americans.

## Everything we suspected about Donald Trump has come true. Donald Trump is a fascist. He comes right out and says it. Even his friends admit it. He's also a whiny loser.

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/01/everything-we-suspected-about-donald-trump-has-come-true/):

> Donald Trump waited less than 24 hours after he was inaugurated as the 45.th. They haven't been moved by Trump calling Portland protesters "Anarchists" and "Agitators" who "Hate our country." Nothing Trump says about the coronavirus matters. People want to know when they're going to get their lives back, and Donald Trump doesn't have an answer for them.

## Federal Agents Don’t Need Army Fatigues | If you’re an officer of the law, dress like one. Leave the soldiering to soldiers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/opinion/federal-agents-trump-uniforms.html):

> In recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has sent hundreds of federal agents into Portland, Ore., to quell protests over racism and police violence. On Monday, the mayors of Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Albuquerque, Washington and Kansas City, Mo., sent a letter to Congress asking for legislation to stop the Trump administration from deploying federal agents to cities without their consent. All the more reason that the federal agents on the streets of American cities be required to wear uniforms that clearly identify themselves and their civilian agency.

`/u/upnorthgirl` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i1pxjb/federal_agents_dont_need_army_fatigues_if_youre/):

> > Many of those federal agents aren’t easily recognizable as law enforcement officials, nor do they act like them. Even the military is concerned about the public confusion sewn into society when heavily armed federal agents dress like soldiers. All the more reason that the federal agents on the streets of American cities be required to wear uniforms that clearly identify themselves and their civilian agency.
> 
> > Complicating matters even more for the average American are the other masked and armed men who have also appeared at public demonstrations in the United States over the past few months — lockdown protesters, anti-government activists, white supremacists, self-declared “militias.” To the unschooled eye, they look remarkably similar, both in the flesh and in the millions of images flitting around the globe at the speed of social media.
> 
> > Camouflage uniforms are intended to conceal a person’s presence and intentions from an enemy, or hunters from their quarry. But in our masked and militarized moment, the righteous should make every effort to publicly stand out from the wicked. **The only reason to wear camouflage in an urban setting — be it federal agents or self-declared militia members — is intimidation.**

## Republicans Resume Fear-Mongering About The Debt. Don't Believe Them.

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/forget-the-debt-republican_n_5f248bb2c5b6a34284bac085):

> Rep. Ken Buck reiterated the message on C-SPAN Wednesday, calling the public debt "The greatest threat to our country right now." Not COVID-19, not terrorism, not rising authoritarian political movements abroad. "It is our national debt that will take us down," Buck said. When Democrats are in power  or when proposals to help working people are on the legislative table  Republicans suddenly insist that adding to the national debt will bring a swift cataclysm. Republicans don't actually believe there is a debt crisis on the horizon.

> One of the few silver linings in the Trump Era: never having to take Republicans seriously again.

## Senate cancels confirmation hearing for Trump nominee who called Obama 'terrorist'

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-military-tata/senate-cancels-confirmation-hearing-for-trump-nominee-who-called-obama-terrorist-idUSKCN24V2FK?utm_source=reddit.com):

> WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate on Thursday abruptly canceled a hearing for President Donald Trump's most divisive nominee to date for a senior Pentagon post, raising questions about whether enough lawmakers would support Anthony Tata, who has called former President Barack Obama "a terrorist leader." Just before Tata's confirmation hearing was set to start on Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee's website said it had been canceled without giving a reason. Democratic lawmakers had signaled they would oppose Tata's nomination, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling Tata "By far Trump's most unqualified & ill-suited senior defense nominee - a high bar." She said in a statement that "An Islamophobic conspiracy theorist who called President Obama a 'terrorist leader' should not be #3 at the Pentagon."

> Almost everyone that Trump nominates is a disgusting person.  They are just as disgusting as Trump himself.  SMH.
