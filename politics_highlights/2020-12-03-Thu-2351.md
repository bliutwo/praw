> Why did the Trump administration do nothing to protect our election from this massive, widespread voter fraud that they are claiming? If what they are saying is true, wouldn't that mean that Trump is dangerously incompetent and unqualified because he did nothing to address the threat? Voter fraud on the scale they are alleging would be one of the greatest attacks ever perpetrated on the United States, yet it happened under Trump's watch. Even of their obviously batshit election conspiracy theories were correct, wouldn't it be a damning indictment on Trump's ability to run the country and keep us safe?

> President-elect Joe Biden told CNN on Thursday that he asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the expert on the coronavirus pandemic, to become his chief medical adviser and part of his Covid-19 response team. "I asked him to stay on the exact same role he's had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well, and be part of the Covid team," Biden said. Fauci told CBS he has spoken to Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, a few times, but that the conversations weren't "Substantive," according to CBS and CNN. Fauci has said he thought the Biden's team was keeping him at arm's length to avoid disputes with Trump.

## QAnon supporters think Biden's medical boot is hiding ankle monitor following secret arrest

> Theory who think that Donald Trump has been waging a secret war against the "Deep state," have regurgitated similar theories used against Hillary Clinton and John McCain, suggesting Biden is wearing a medical boot to hide an ankle monitor because he has been arrested. "Biden has an ankle bracelet. Biden didn't hurt his foot. He's got ankle cuffs on," tweeted Joyce Ramgatie. "In QAnon. world, politicians only wear medical boots in order to conceal a tracking monitor after their arrest, never because politicians tend to be old people with bad bones," tweeted Travis View, host of the QAnon.

## Poll: Two-Thirds of Americans Favor Raising Taxes on Incomes Over $400K

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/03/poll-two-thirds-americans-favor-raising-taxes-incomes-over-400k):

> A compelling majority of Americans favor raising taxes on people who make more than $400,000 per year, according to a new poll published Thursday by the New York Times and Survey Monkey. Among people who identify as either Democrats or Democrat-leaning, support for raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 is, at 88%, overwhelming. Biden's tax plan would raise the top tax rate for people with the highest incomes to 39.6%. On related issues of economic inequality, the new survey also found that nearly two-thirds of respondents favor making four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free for any students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually.
