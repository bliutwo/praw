Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-endorses-joe-biden-dnc-speech-video-2020-8):

> Former President Barack Obama delivered a forceful endorsement of his former vice president and the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, on the third night of the Democratic National Convention Wednesday. "We have to get busy building it up - by pouring all our effort into these 76 days, and by voting like never before - for Joe and Kamala, and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for," Obama said. Obama largely remained on the sidelines of the Democratic primary until it became clear that Biden would be the party's nominee.

> > "I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did," Obama said. "For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends."

> You tell him, Mr. President!!!

## Barack Obama will slam the president at the DNC: ‘Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t’

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/19/dnc-2020-barack-obama-rips-donald-trump-in-speech.html):

> WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama will deliver a searing critique of his successor, President Donald Trump, during his keynote address Wednesday night at the virtual Democratic National Convention. "Twelve years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn't know I'd end up finding a brother. Joe and I came from different places and different generations. But what I quickly came to admire about him is his resilience, born of too much struggle; his empathy, born of too much grief. Joe's a man who learned early on to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him: 'No one's better than you, but you're better than nobody.'". "Over eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president. He's got the character and the experience to make us a better country."

> Trump is going to implode like we have never seen. Obama lives rent free in his head. He is completely obsessed and wont even hang is portrait.
