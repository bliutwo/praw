I have worked for several TV stations and all three major metro dailies. Four years ago, I started a nonprofit site and we have grown each year, helping to irrigate the growing news deserts in Nevada.

> > "You know, I'm not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I'm afraid he's going to run again and lose. Because he can do this again," Lieu said during the third day of Trump's Senate impeachment trial. 
> 
> Yeah, Susan Collins is proof positive that this fear is warranted. She infamously said she thought Trump learned his lesson after his first impeachment trial. And, then he proceeded to sow doubt about the election, and then slowed the mail to do so. And then, after the election, his campaign and allies filed countless, bogus lawsuits trying to stop it, before he finally decided to incite an insurrection after all his efforts failed. 
> 
> Trump doesn’t learn lessons— he just doubles down on his actions even further. He embodies, *’If at first you don’t succeed, just Lie, Lie, Again’...* 🤨🙄🤦🏽‍♂️

## House Democrats Are Showing That Trump Is More Guilty Than You Thought. They have produced evidence that he directly incited and inflamed his extremist supporters as the Capitol attack occurred.

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/02/house-democrats-are-showing-that-trump-is-more-guilty-than-you-thought/):

> Castro played video showing a Trump rioter using a bullhorn to read Trump's tweet condemning Pence to the crowd on Capitol Hill. In October, a pickup truck caravan of Trump supporters surrounded a Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway and nearly drove it off the road. Afterward, as Plaskett noted, Trump tweeted: "These patriots did nothing wrong." Keith Lee, the Trump loyalist who was one of the organizers of that caravan, she said, was at the Capitol on January 6. Of course, there is a load of evidence showing that Trump's brownshirts believed they were there on Trump's behalf and at his urging.

`/u/polifnx` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lhrh4c/house_democrats_are_showing_that_trump_is_more/):

> Yeah, I went into it knowing that it was an easy case to make for them, but I have to admit that I have been thoroughly surprised and impressed by how deep they went. They have all bases covered. Insurmountable evidence. There is literally no argument against it. 
> 
> I mean, i knew there was sufficient evidence already but the case they’ve made is fucking *damning*. 
> 
> Which makes me even angrier that the QOP will still vote to acquit.

## ‘So much for backing the blue’: Impeachment trial hears rioters’ abuse and violence against police at Capitol

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-trial-capitol-police-b1801126.html):

> Democratic House impeachment managers shared footage of rioters hurling abuse and threatening police officers protecting the Capitol and lawmakers, during the 6 January insurrection. Police officers heard chants of "Traitor" and faced mobs chanting "Fight for Trump" inside the Capitol building, captured in widely shared footage aired inside the Senate chamber on Wednesday during the third day of the trial. The union chairman representing US Capitol Police has said that nearly 140 officers from Capitol Police and Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department were injured during the assault.

## Donald Trump Tweeted Attack on Mike Pence Minutes After Hearing VP Was Fleeing Capitol Rioters

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tweeted-attack-mike-pence-minutes-capitol-rioters-1568568):

> Donald Trump criticized Mike Pence on Twitter just minutes after being told his vice president was being led out of the Senate chamber by security amid riots at the U.S. Capitol, according to a republican senator. Surveillance footage shows that Pence was removed from the Senate at 2:14 p.m. Ten minutes later, a tweet from Trump's now-banned account appeared to suggest-falsely-that Pence could have overturned the election result in his role as presiding officer of the Senate. He said: "Even after the Capitol was attacked; even after he was personally targeted; even after his family was targeted; Vice President Pence stood strong and certified the election. Vice President Pence showed us what it means to be an American."

`/u/billthomson` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lhpei4/donald_trump_tweeted_attack_on_mike_pence_minutes/):

> >Tommy Tuberville told reporters on Wednesday that he informed the then-president that Pence was being escorted to safety in a phone call during the January 6 disorder. Trump had called to ask for the Alabama representative's help in delaying the Senate's confirmation of Joe Biden's election victory, Tuberville said, but the call was cut short.
> 
> >"Well, I don't know if you've ever talked to President Trump. You don't get many words in, but he didn't get a chance to say a whole lot, because I said, 'Mr. President, they just took the vice president out, I've got to go,'" Tuberville said.
> 
> I wish they could call witnesses to discuss what Trump did in the hours while Congress was under attack. I think that's quite relevant. Rather than working to save the government he was making calls to Senators asking them to delay certification.

## President Biden cancels funding for Trump border wall

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56031481):

> US President Joe Biden has rescinded the national emergency order used to fund Donald Trump's border wall. "Trump's national emergency was never about security," wrote Arizona Democratic Congressman Raul Grivalva on Twitter following Biden's announcement. Former Trump campaign advisor Jason Miller also took to Twitter to comment on the decision, writing "Biden loves illegal immigration".
