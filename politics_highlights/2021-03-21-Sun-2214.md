## Evidence in Capitol Attack Most Likely Supports Sedition Charges, Prosecutor Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/capitol-riot-sedition.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes):

> March 21, 2021.WASHINGTON - Evidence the government obtained in the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol most likely meets the bar necessary to charge some of the suspects with sedition, Michael R. Sherwin, the federal prosecutor who had been leading the Justice Department's inquiry, said in an interview that aired on Sunday. Mr. Sherwin told "60 Minutes" that the government had charged more than 400 people. A medical examiner has not determined how Officer Sicknick died, Mr. Sherwin said, so two suspects were charged with assaulting an officer instead of murder.

> Exactly what happened on January 6, 2021. Again, *LOCK THEM ALL UP!!*☝️🤬

## Letter: GOP only pleas for bipartisanship when in the minority

Summary of [original article](https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/mailbag/letter-gop-only-pleas-for-bipartisanship-when-in-the-minority/article_406cb20c-6f2c-59c3-a522-9e6802856227.html):

> Letter: GOP only pleas for bipartisanship when in the minority. Five years ago, when a Supreme Court seat needed to be filled, I noted no bipartisanship for even entertaining then-president Barack Obama's choice, Merrick Garland, who was considered a political moderate. Four years ago, when the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House, I didn't notice any consideration for a Democrat's point of view.

> The GOP had the keys to the car for 12 years straight, 80-92.  Then when the Dems won and got the keys back in 92, the GOP was so butthurt over it, they sabotaged the car, again and again.  In 2008, when the Dems got the keys back from Bush, this time they came out of the fucking woodwork with the Tea Party, Glen Beck's chalkboard of apoplectic fits and seizures, and the GOP literally had a meeting to declare they'd block everything Obama tried to do.  This time in 2020, well shit, the GOP couldn't even pretend to give the keys back to the Dems, they threw any and all pretense of democracy and government to the curb and stormed the fucking Capitol with bear spray.  I'd say it's a wrap, folks.

## ‘We need to focus on Earth’: Bernie Sanders responds to Elon Musk’s space plans with call for progressive tax. ‘The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy’.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/we-need-to-focus-on-earth-bernie-sanders-responds-to-elon-musk-s-space-travel-plans-with-call-for-progressive-taxes-b1820304.html):

> Bernie Sanders has responded to Elon Musk's defense of the Tesla founder's enormous wealth amid growing discussions in Congress about income inequality. Mr Sanders then circled back on the Space X founder on Sunday: "Space travel is an exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth and create a progressive tax system so that children don't go hungry, people are not homeless and all Americans have healthcare. The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy." Under the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, which applies pressure on top-earning companies to raise wages, tax penalties would begin at.5 per cent for companies that pay their top executives between 50 and 100 times more than their typical workers.

## Black Voters Felt Intimidated by Police, Armed Trump Supporters at Southern Voting Sites: Report

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/black-voters-felt-intimidated-police-armed-trump-supporters-southern-voting-sites-report-1577671):

> In a seemingly "Unprecedented" paradox, local officers were often stationed at election sites to help prevent "Self-deputized" white supremacists groups or armed supporters of former President Donald Trump from "Monitoring" voters. The SPLC cited the white supremacist Oath Keepers and Three Percenters as militia groups that initially prompted law enforcement to be at the polls for protection in the first place-just one of many unique challenges faced by voting rights activists and Southern voters themselves last November. The SPLC also criticized additional Southern states for taking advantage of new tactics that could suppress voting-such as Texas implementing a photo ID law and North Carolina passing a voter law that a federal court later ruled aimed at Black voters with "Almost surgical precision," according to the report.

> This headline was basically a stated goal of many Conservatives in the south.
