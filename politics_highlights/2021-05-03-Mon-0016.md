> 
> If it goes through congress, it will just get obstructed by the GOP who seem to enjoy seeing people suffer.

## New Polls: It Turns Out Americans Like a Normal, Boring President - It’s been 15 years since Americans were this optimistic about the future.

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2021/05/new-polls-it-turns-out-americans-like-a-normal-boring-president/):

> Americans largely approve of Joe Biden's performance as president so far, two new polls indicate. Out of the 1,558 adults surveyed, 57 percent said they approved of Biden's handling of the pandemic. For one, more Americans think the country has become more divided than united since Biden took office, according to the ABC/Ipsos poll.

## Ed Gonzalez Has Spent Years Fighting ICE. President Biden Just Nominated Him to Run the Agency.

Summary of [original article](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/ed-gonzalez-ice-nomination/):

> While Gonzalez has won a reputation in Houston as a reformer, he didn't garner much national attention until his surprise nomination by Biden. Gonzalez has spent much of his time in the role fighting the Trump administration's immigration policies. As ICE director, Gonzalez will have the power to make systemic changes to America's immigration enforcement.

`/u/Pineapple__Jews` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n3f3wh/ed_gonzalez_has_spent_years_fighting_ice/):

> Good. Let the destruction of ICE begin.
> 
> I like how Biden is taking one from the Republican playbook by picking someone who's values are antithetical to the values of the organization they will be running. Thanks for the idea guys.

## After President Joe Biden’s first 100 days, two-thirds of Americans believe US headed in right direction

Summary of [original article](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/05/after-president-joe-bidens-first-100-days-two-thirds-of-americans-believe-us-headed-in-right-direction.html):

> A new poll shows almost two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction after President Joe Biden's first 100 days in office. While Biden has consistently drawn strong support for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and its stimulus checks, Americans are more divided on how to spend tax dollars as Congress considers a pair of $2 trillion packages from Biden on jobs, infrastructure, families and education. President Joe Biden's first 100 days: 53% approve of job performance, two-thirds approve of COVID efforts, new poll says.

> That means about \~14% of Trump-supporters actually swallowed their pride and came back to reality? (I'm not good with maff.)
