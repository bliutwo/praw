## 'It's Going to Take Everyone': Demonstrations Planned Nationwide to 'Save the Post Office From Trump'

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/17/its-going-take-everyone-demonstrations-planned-nationwide-save-post-office-trump):

> As the House Democratic leadership calls members back to Washington, D.C. for an emergency vote on legislation to reverse Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's disruptive and possibly illegal policy changes, a coalition of progressive advocacy groups is planning demonstrations across the country as part of an urgent effort to remove DeJoy and "Save the post office" from President Donald Trump. "At 11 am, we will show up at local post offices across the country to save the post office from Trump and declare that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy must resign," said the organizers of Saturday's demonstrations. In addition to alarming postal workers who are experiencing DeJoy's changes firsthand, the postmaster general's new policies have sparked nationwide outrage as reports abound of prescription medicine delays, removal of mailboxes in several states, and abrupt cuts to post office hours.

> A lot of people depend on the Postal Service for vital things like medications. The Postal Service is widely popular so sabotaging it won’t help win Trump any votes.

## Mitch McConnell Under Bipartisan Pressure to Recall Senate Over USPS, Stimulus

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/mcconnell-bipartisan-pressure-recall-senate-usps-stimulus-1525454):

> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing bipartisan calls for the upper chamber's recess to be cut short so senators can vote on emergency U.S. Postal Service funding and iron out the terms of a second coronavirus relief deal. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said: "Leader McConnell should call the Senate back into session this week so we can work in a bipartisan manner to pass urgently needed COVID relief and postal legislation. This is about the well-being and livelihood of Michiganders." The bipartisan group of lawmakers called on the Senate to return from recess as White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows indicated that he was open to the idea of a separate bill for USPS relief funding.

`/u/CreepingTurnip` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/iba0be/mitch_mcconnell_under_bipartisan_pressure_to/):

> There should be bipartisan pressure for him to retire for blatently and admittedly refusing to govern, and for even allowing this recess at all.

## Pictures of locked mailboxes circulate on Twitter amid USPS crisis

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/locked-mailboxes-circulating-social-media-1525480):

> Others have noted that the practice isn't new and that locked mailboxes are not a nefarious attempt to suppress mail-in voting-but to prevent mail theft. Another Twitter user, Ronni Peck, responded to his tweet saying that mailboxes in Burbank were locked on Sundays and after hours to prevent mail theft. In another tweet alongside a picture of a locked mailbox, Badeen added: "Before you freak out about locked USPS boxes, here is a pic I took of the same thing on February 17th, 2020 outside the North Hollywood post office after hours. Don't know if it's more widespread now but it's nothing new."
