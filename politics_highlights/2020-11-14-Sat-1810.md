## If Democrats can't stop acting like losers when they win, America is doomed. Yes, this election was unsettling — but Democrats won. It's time to fight for what they believe, not surrender

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/14/if-democrats-cant-stop-acting-like-losers-when-they-win-america-is-doomed/):

> Anyone treating the ignorance, bigotry and delusion of 72 million Americans as revelatory hasn't spent much time reading about American history, or even paying attention to cable news over the past four years. Writers in Slate, the Guardian, the New York Times and the New York Review of Books, along with a flurry of commentators on television, are bemoaning the strength of Trump's turnout and warning Democrats that the country is beyond the influence of the progressive wing of the party. Progressives who express disappointment with the overly conciliatory and corporate Democrats are correct in their condemnation, but too often miss what the far right has understood for decades: Political parties are malleable.

## ‘Million MAGA March’ Falls 900,000 or So Short of a Full Deck

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/million-maga-march-falls-900000-or-so-short-of-a-full-dec):

> They came to town to collectively demand the disenfranchisement of more than 78 million Americans, Joe Biden voters, and to reaffirm that "Legal votes" can only be cast by white folks outside of miscegenated cities. The disparate groups of demonstrators called the protest by various names, including "Stop the Steal," "March for Trump" and the "Million MAGA March"-the latter of which was cribbed from the 1995 "Million Man March," because these people can't go a day without stealing from Black folks. There were far less than a million people there, though the White House way overinflated the numbers on hand for Trump, just as they did four years ago at this administration's inauguration.

`/u/osaucyone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/juawuy/million_maga_march_falls_900000_or_so_short_of_a/):

> 988,400 actually.

## Pennsylvania Won’t Need a Recount to Certify Biden Victory, State Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/decision-2020/pennsylvania-wont-need-a-recount-to-certify-biden-victory-state-says/2596918/):

> President-elect Joe Biden and other statewide election winners in Pennsylvania are all past the margin that would trigger a recount, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said in a news statement Friday. The latest Pennsylvania results show Biden beating President Donald Trump by more than 59,000 votes, a margin of more than 0.8%. Early, incomplete returns on election night - which were mostly based on in-person votes - showed Trump leading in Pennsylvania. The lead chipped away as more mail-in ballots were counted, and eventually Biden pulled ahead. NBC News projected Biden as the winner in Pennsylvania on Nov. 7.

> If Trump says that he will pay for a recount, whatever you do, get cash in advance.

## 'Outrageous': Republicans blasted for alerting only GOP side about COVID cases in Minnesota Senate

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/outrageous-republicans-blasted-alerting-only-gop-side-about-covid-cases-minnesota-senate-1547505):

> The Minnesota Senate GOP is facing serious criticism after failing to alert the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of a COVID-19 outbreak ahead of a special session on Thursday. "It is outrageous and completely unacceptable that Senate DFLers were not notified of the recent COVID-19 outbreak among Senate Republicans prior to Thursday's floor session," DFL Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent said in a statement. "I do not understand why Senate Republicans chose to share positive cases only with members of their own party, putting staff and other senators at risk. We must put aside our differences and look out for our neighbors. At the end of the day, we're all Minnesotans."

`/u/SnooSprouts5187` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ju88is/outrageous_republicans_blasted_for_alerting_only/):

> Do you have to be a sociopath to be a Republican? Seriously.
