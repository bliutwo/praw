## U.S. House to vote on ending federal ban on marijuana

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/marijuana/2020/11/us-house-to-vote-on-ending-federal-ban-on-marijuana.html):

> A postponed vote on landmark legislation ending the federal ban on cannabis will take place within a week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Friday. "By advancing the MORE Act, the House of Representatives sends an unmistakable signal that America is ready to close the book marijuana prohibition and end the senseless oppression and fear that this failed policy wreaks on otherwise law-abiding citizens," said Justin Strekal, political director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws."Americans are ready to responsibly legalize and regulate marijuana, and this vote shows some lawmakers are finally listening." A vote on the bill had been scheduled to take place before the election, but House Democratic leaders delayed it to avoid the optics of appearing to put a vote on cannabis ahead of passing a new coronavirus stimulus package.

> And if it passes the House, it will IMMEDIATELY...find it's way to Mitch McConnell's desk where it will sit, and whither and die like the 400+ other pieces of legislation that McConnell refuses to advance. Now, put a Federalist Society judge nomination on his desk? That'll get passed quicker than shit through a goose!

## Trump Supporters in Georgia Ask RNC Chair Why They Should Vote in Runoffs When System Is 'Rigged'

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-supporters-georgia-ask-rnc-chair-why-they-should-vote-runoffs-when-system-rigged-1550938?piano_t=1):

> Frustrated supporters of President Donald Trump in Georgia challenged Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel on why they should even vote in the upcoming Senate runoffs if "Rigged" elections are "Already decided." McDaniel's Saturday campaign stop in Marietta, Georgia, appeared to backfire as Trump supporters who have adopted the president's conspiratorial accusations about "Voter fraud" asked why their vote even matters. Trump supporters present at the event appeared apathetic about the upcoming vote, saying the expansion of "Money and work when is already decided" seems pointless.

`/u/Dapple4321` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2v21a/trump_supporters_in_georgia_ask_rnc_chair_why/):

> Republicans complain and moan before falling in line and voting in droves, just like every election for at least the past 40 years.   If you are a Democrat in GA, then don’t think for a moment that you can stay home because I guarantee this is just political theater; Republicans will turn out to vote.

The court said that the "Petitioners' failure to file their facial constitutional challenge in a timely manner" was the basis of the decision. Justice Wecht wrote: "It is not our role to lend legitimacy to such transparent and untimely efforts to subvert the will of Pennsylvania voters. Courts should not decide elections when the will of the voters is clear."

## Twitter Has Flagged 200 of Trump’s Posts as ‘Disputed’ or Misleading Since Election Day. Does It Make a Difference?

Summary of [original article](https://variety.com/2020/politics/news/twitter-trump-200-disputed-misleading-claims-election-1234841137/):

> In the 24 days since Election Day, Twitter has added warnings labels to 200 of President Trump's tweets or posts he has retweeted indicating that they contain false, disputed or misleading info. Overall since polls closed Nov. 3, about 30% of Trump's posts on Twitter have been flagged by Twitter as containing or potentially including misinformation, according to a Variety analysis. To be fair, Trump and his followers would be spreading fake claims about the 2020 election results even if Twitter didn't exist.

`/u/MeowFood` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2rd69/twitter_has_flagged_200_of_trumps_posts_as/):

> Can we stop for a minute and reflect on the fact that he has tweeted this many times, regardless of content, in the past 3 weeks? I don’t think I’ve tweeted 200 times in the past 10 years. He has the worst case of logorrhea I’ve ever seen.
