## 'A Big Win': USPS Must Turn Over Docs About DeJoy's Potential Conflicts of Interest | "The stench of corruption wafting up from Louis DeJoy's office is so thick seagulls are flying in from the Jersey Shore and circling overhead."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/08/18/big-win-usps-must-turn-over-docs-about-dejoys-potential-conflicts-interest):

> A leading government ethics watchdog on Wednesday cheered a federal judge's ruling ordering the United States Postal Service to hand over documents concerning potential conflicts of interest involving embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Over the past seven years, the USPS has reportedly paid approximately $286 million to XPO Logistics, DeJoy's ex-employer, and has "ramped up its business" with the company since DeJoy's appointment as postmaster general. Last Friday, a Post report that DeJoy had purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of publicly traded bonds from Brookfield Asset Management-where USPS Board of Governors Chair Ron Bloom is a managing partner-fueled further calls for DeJoy's termination, with Connolly calling Bloom and the postmaster general "bandits" whose "conflicts of interest do nothing but harm the Postal Service and the American people.

## If Liz Cheney’s Assigning Blame for an “Epic Failure” in Afghanistan, She Can Start With Her Father

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/afghanistan-withdrawal-liz-cheney-dick-cheney/):

> "This has been an epic failure across the board, one we're going to pay for for years to come," declared Representative Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, as she denounced Joe Biden's decision to complete the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The steady expansion of the mission in Afghanistan as an exercise in nation building began with Cheney and Bush. Now, Liz Cheney, every bit the hawk her father was, and every bit the partisan hack her father was, is claiming, "We were able to prevent the Taliban from establishing safe havens with 2,500 to 3,500 troops on the ground."

> Our mission in Afghanistan was to transfer wealth from taxpayers to war profiteers like Halliburton.

> Darth Cheney did not fail in Afghanistan. He’s enjoying the spoils of his victory right now.

## Florida Gov. DeSantis faces growing revolt from school districts imposing mask mandates

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/08/19/florida-mask-mandate-desantis-revolt/):

> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is facing a revolt from a growing number of school districts - including some of the largest in the country - that have passed tough mask mandates for the new school year despite his administration's threat to sanction them. Five Florida school districts have now approved a mask mandate that allows for a student to opt out only with a note from a medical doctor, which goes well beyond what DeSantis set as policy in a July 30 executive order. Nearly 40 percent of Florida's schoolchildren are or will be attending schools with mask mandates - and a few other big school districts are likely to impose their own mandates soon.

To begin with, the lawmaker's salary last year from Shooter's Grill, the gun-themed restaurant she owns with her husband, Jayson, in Rifle, Colorado, is listed as exactly $1. Jayson Boebert, however, brought home nearly half a million dollars working for the energy firm Terra Energy Productions in 2020 and is on track to earn $768,000 in 2021

> 
> > **“If they asked why, I told them covid is a miserable way to die and I can’t watch them die like that**,” wrote Valentine, who has specialized in family medicine with Diagnostic and Medical Clinic since 2008.

> So a sex offender goes from income N/A to $450k in a year.  That's how you get a letter from the IRS about an audit.  Which may turn out to be legal but... Paying a congresswoman's husband a bribe salary isn't exactly legal.  
> 
> Meh, nothing will come of it.  Congress doesn't care that much about its own dirty fingers and it's not like her reputation will take a hit.  Take solace in the likely hood he's probably too stupid to save that money.
