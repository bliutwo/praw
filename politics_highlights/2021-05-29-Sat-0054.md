## 'It's the Filibuster or Democracy,' Say Progressives After GOP Tanks January 6 Commission

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/05/28/its-filibuster-or-democracy-say-progressives-after-gop-tanks-january-6-commission):

> Intensifying progressive calls to eliminate the legislative filibuster, Senate Republicans wielded the archaic procedural tool on Friday to torpedo a bill that sought to establish an independent commission to probe the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Asked Thursday whether he would be willing to change his position on the filibuster if Republicans used the tool to sink the January 6 commission, Manchin told reporters, "I'm not ready to destroy our government." In a speech on the Senate floor in the wake of Friday's vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted Republican lawmakers for mounting a "Partisan filibuster against an independent commission to report on January 6th"-but did not endorse progressive demands to eliminate the filibuster as a tool of nearly effortless obstruction.

`/u/QuirkyEdge4428` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nn6072/its_the_filibuster_or_democracy_say_progressives/):

> Manchin, Sinema, Tester, Feinstein etc: “filibuster it is!”

## Bill to Federally Decriminalize Marijuana, Expunge Records Reintroduced in Congress

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/bill-federally-decriminalize-marijuana-expunge-records-reintroduced-congress-1596038):

> A bill to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level and allow people with cannabis-related convictions to have their records expunged has been reintroduced in Congress. The MORE Act would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act, providing states with the sole authority to determine cannabis policy. Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an organization opposed to marijuana legalization and commercialization, called the bill a "Complete nonstarter" and the "Wrong approach" for the federal government to take.

## Manchin: Republican filibuster of Jan. 6 commission "unconscionable"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/manchin-jan-6-republican-filibuster-unconscionable-b906f394-b8b0-479a-81fa-91f4caf595a2.html):

> Sen. Joe Manchin on Friday said Senate Republicans' decision to vote against a bill creating a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riots was "Unconscionable" and "The betrayal of the oath we each take." The big picture: Manchin said in a statement on Thursday that Republicans had no excuse to vote against the Jan. 6 commission, saying they "Continue to live in fear." He called the Jan. 6 Capitol riots a never-before-seen attack in U.S. history. Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - who publicly oppose eliminating the filibuster - had pushed Senate Republicans to "Find a path forward" on the commission so "Our nation never has to endure an attack at the hands of our countrymen again."

`/u/Irish_Whiskey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nn4wnk/manchin_republican_filibuster_of_jan_6_commission/):

> Then. Stop. Them.
> 
> You and the two faced Arizona dilettante are the only things stopping this legislation from moving forward.

## 'Our Republic Is Being Dismantled from Within': GOP Blocks Jan. 6th Investigation

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/senate-filibuster-commission-january-6th-mcconnell-1175720/):

> On Friday, Republican senators stood on that same ground and voted to block the creation of a bipartisan commission to understand what happened during the January 6th Capitol Riot and how to prevent future acts of political violence like it. The vote comes after weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over how the January 6th commission would function and who would serve on it. Family and friends of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who was attacked with bear spray on January 6th and died not long afterward, also lobbied Republicans to vote in favor of creating the commission.

`/u/Cfwydirk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nn7odz/our_republic_is_being_dismantled_from_within_gop/):

> They blocked investigation by congress.
> 
> NOT the criminal charges the FBI and Justice Dept. are currently pursuing.
> 
> The republicans are fine with the unwashed masses being prosecuted.
> 
> Just not congressmen!
