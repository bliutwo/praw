## Dr. Jill Biden Receives Support After WSJ Op-Ed: This 'Would Never Have Been Written About a Man' — "The @WSJ should be embarrassed to print the disgusting and sexist attack on @DrBiden," President-elect Joe Biden's transition team spokesperson tweeted.

Summary of [original article](https://people.com/politics/jill-biden-receives-support-wall-street-journal-sexist-op-ed/):

> Jill Biden has received an overwhelming amount of support online after a Wall Street Journal op-ed was deemed "Sexist" for urging the soon-to-be first lady to drop the "Dr." before her name. Prior to the Nov. 3 president election, Dr. Biden confirmed that she would continue teaching if she and her husband, President-elect Joe Biden, 78, reached the White House. Dr. Biden added, "It's important, and I want people to value teachers and know their contributions and lift up their profession."

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-churches-hate-crimes_n_5fd65370c5b690d5d304fa33):

> Police are investigating as possible hate crimes the destruction of Black Lives Matter signs at churches in Washington during violent pro-Donald Trump demonstrations Saturday, officials announced Sunday. Pro-Trump demonstrators tore down a Black Lives Matter sign and set it on fire at Asbury United Methodist Church, the oldest Black church in Washington that still sits on its original site, church officials said Sunday. Rallygoers that night also reportedly tore down Black Lives Matter signs at nearby Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church and Luther Place Memorial Church.

## Church Pastor on Trump Supporters Burning BLM Sign: “It Was Reminiscent of Cross Burnings”

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/maga-black-lives-matter-sign-asbury-methodist-church.html):

> "Last night demonstrators who were part of the MAGA gatherings tore down our Black Lives Matter sign and literally burned it in the street," said the Rev. Ianther M. Mills of Asbury Methodist Church. "It pained me especially to see our name, Asbury, in flames. For me it was reminiscent of cross burnings." Rev. Mills added that the church would "Move forward, undaunted in our assurance that Black Lives Matter and we are obligated to shout the truth without ceasing." But she did say she was "Alarmed" that the type of violence that was on display Saturday night was not being "Denounced at the highest levels." She also pointed out that "If this was a marauding group of men of color going through the city, and destroying property, they would have been followed and arrested." The pastor of Asbury United Methodist Church in DC responds to the burning of the church's Black Lives Matter sign last night by people who appeared to be affiliated with Proud Boys.

## 2020 was the year that American science denial became lethal

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-12-13/anti-science-gop-lethal):

> America's political leadership has chosen to paint the evolution of that knowledge in the 10 months or so since the pandemic erupted to be evidence not of the scientific method as it should work, but of scientific bad faith. The political war on science does more than merely subvert trust in the scientific method; it stifles scientific debate. Climate change denial - the gold standard of anti-science policymaking until the pandemic appeared - put money in the pockets of the oil and gas industry, which saw it could continue marketing its products with abandon as long as it could foment public doubts about their connection to global warming.

`/u/Meta_Digital` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kcmgbt/2020_was_the_year_that_american_science_denial/):

> This is a pretty narrow understanding. Climate change denial, for instance, has been lethal for decades already.
> 
> Hell, any studies or data that even mildly contradicts the cult of capitalism have been violently suppressed for the last century.
> 
> Science denial being lethal isn't new; it's become a tradition.
