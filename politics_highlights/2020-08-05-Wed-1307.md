> I am Canadian without private health insurance, after losing my job due to pandemic lay-offs. My partner recently got very sick and needed to stay as an inpatient at the hospital for two weeks. She required a private isolation room, several MRIs, CT scans, blood tests, and I'm not sure what else. She also needed a COVID test on admittance (we got the negative results in ~12 hours).
> 
> I’d never been in a situation like this before, so I was worried how much it would cost us, but in the end I was out less than $100, for some antibiotics after she was discharged. Everything else was covered by the government. I feel more love for my country than ever.
