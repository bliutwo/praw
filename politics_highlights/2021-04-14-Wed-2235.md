> There is no set number of justices in the Constitution.

> I think it's time to expand the court again.

## Republicans say Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal aids terrorists, but US intelligence has zeroed in on homegrown extremism as a 'greater immediate domestic threat'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/gop-biden-afghanistan-withdrawal-aids-terrorism-us-intelligence-homegrown-extremism-2021-4):

> Experts have long dismissed this as a myth, largely because the evidence points to domestic extremism being the greatest terror threat to the US. The US invaded Afghanistan less than a month after the 9/11 attacks due to the Taliban's links to Al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden. US intelligence agencies do not believe that Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations pose an imminent threat to strike the US from Afghanistan, according to The New York Times, even as a major annual intelligence report released Tuesday said that the Taliban is "Likely to make gains on the battlefield, and the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support." The intelligence report also said that while groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda continue to "Seek to conduct attacks inside the United States" and pose a danger to US interests overseas, it underscored that "US-based lone actors and small cells with a broad range of ideological motivations pose a greater immediate domestic threat."

`/u/Helfix` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mqwtpw/republicans_say_bidens_afghanistan_withdrawal/):

> Wait a minute now - Republicans think leaving Afghanistan will aid terrorists?
> 
> Then why did they say nothing when Trump removed troops from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq? Why did they not speak when Trump committed the U.S. to leaving Afghanistan by May?
> 
> Sounds like the double speak similar to ‘national debt’.

## House committee approves D.C. statehood, setting up likely passage in the full chamber

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-statehood-markup/2021/04/14/a7478654-9c8e-11eb-8005-bffc3a39f6d3_story.html):

> Legislation to make D.C. the 51st state advanced from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Wednesday, paving the way for approval by the full House for the second consecutive year - possibly as soon as next week. The vote injects another shot of momentum in Democrats' favor as they seek to capitalize on their majorities in both chambers of Congress and control of the White House to push D.C. statehood further than it has gone before. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer announced last week that the House would vote on the bill the week of April 19.Like last year, the bill is likely to face significant hurdles in the Senate.

## Japayal Calls for Crackdown on Wealthiest After IRS Chief Says Tax Evasion Costs US $1 Trillion a Year | "We don't just need a wealth tax, we also need to give the IRS the tools it needs to make sure the ultra-rich finally pay their fair share."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/04/14/japayal-calls-crackdown-wealthiest-after-irs-chief-says-tax-evasion-costs-us-1):

> Following IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig's admission Tuesday that tax dodgers are depriving the federal government of as much as $1 trillion or more per year, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called for strengthening the agency's ability to crack down on the rampant tax avoidance strategies used by America's wealthiest individuals and corporations. Although the IRS has officially calculated a "Tax gap" of $441 billion based on figures from 2011-2013, Rettig-who was appointed to lead the IRS in 2018 by former President Donald Trump after spending decades battling the agency-said the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid "Could approach and possibly exceed $1 trillion per year." President Biden's corporate tax plan recognizes that raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent without closing loopholes will allow corporations to continue paying $0 or single-digit effective tax rates.

> It seems like enforcing our existing laws a whole lot better should be the first step on a whole list of subjects.
