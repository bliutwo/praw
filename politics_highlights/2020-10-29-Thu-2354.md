> According to [the Atlantic,](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/) republicans in the PA legislature are planning on saying there's too much voter fraud, so they have to choose the electors instead of using the state's popular vote to decide electors. 
> 
> What happens if they do this, the case is brought to the SCOTUS, and the SCOTUS rules in their favor, even though it's illegitimate? We know it's illegitimate because they said it before there are any votes and because they will have no proof of rampant voter fraud, since it doesn't happen. 
> 
> I personally find it unlikely that will happen and think the republicans openly talking about it like they do in the article is just a form of voter suppression (why bother voting if you think republicans will just steal it?) but it is entirely possible, right? I feel like it would be an actual coup by the SCOTUS, especially if PA were to be a deciding state in the election. Is that too dramatic? Again, I know this is incredibly unlikely and I don't think it will happen, but I believe we have to be prepared and understand the situation since they are saying that this is their plan. 
> 
> It seems John Roberts's rulings on recent election cases lean towards the idea of "let the states do what they want" and not "protect the vote." How do you think this will impact voter suppression cases? Do you think he will favor letting states suppress the vote? What recourse do voters have if the SCOTUS refuses to protect our vote?
> 
> Do you believe the republican appointed justices have been acting in good faith in recent election rulings that favor voter suppression? Kavanaugh's recent opinion has [several factually incorrect statements](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/brett-kavanaugh-voter-suppression-wisconsin-mistakes.html) in it. How can someone as important as a SCOTUS member get away with that?
> 
> Do you think the SCOTUS having 3 people who worked on Bush v Gore will impact their votes in favor of the republican candidates in election cases?
> 
> If the SCOTUS does do a coup and give Trump the election via illegitimate court cases by republicans, what can we do? 
> 
> Please don't say "they won't do this." Everyone says this when I ask. I know they probably won't do this, and I'm not even actually worried that they will, but *what if* they do? Republicans are actively saying this is their plan. It's not impossible for the SCOTUS to be corrupt. I personally believe people who refuse to admit it is possible are also dangerous to democracy.

## Forget the presidency. It’s Mitch McConnell’s dysfuntional Senate we urgently need to change

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/biden-trump-who-wins-senate-mitch-mcconnell-b1402789.html):

> Democrats, who will likely keep control of the House, are also hoping to win the Senate, whether or not Biden wins out. Senate Democrats still haven't found a way to effectively stymie Republican tactics, as the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court shows. They see winning the Senate as their best chance of turning the tide and will need up to four seats to take control.

## Brett Kavanaugh Concedes Error, Corrects False Claim About Vermont … Vermont Still Not Happy

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/awkward/brett-kavanaugh-concedes-error-corrects-false-claim-about-vermont-vermont-still-not-happy/):

> Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos sent a polite and formal letter to Supreme Court Clerk Scott Harris documenting Kavanaugh's mistake and posted a less formal viral tweet which dunked on the conservative justice for his "Erroneous claim" about the Vermont making no changes to election rules. "First, beginning on Sept. 18, Vermont mailed every active registered voter a ballot and a prepaid return envelope," Condos explained in the semi-open letter. "The opinion still misrepresents the significant changes we made here in Vermont to ensure every vote counts in the middle of a global pandemic, so that no voter has to choose between their health and their right to vote."

## Arizona is about to turn blue — and the reason is John McCain. My usually Republican neighborhood is now abundant with Biden-Harris signs

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/arizona-2020-election-result-polls-democrat-john-mccain-trump-pence-b1431683.html):

> President Trump's attacks on our Arizona senator, former GOP presidential candidate, Vietnam War veteran, POW and hero did not go over well. Their supporters are fervent and if it were not for the pandemic, and Trump's statements about Senator McCain, Arizona might have been an easy win for them. From what I am seeing and hearing here, and from what I have witnessed in my surrounding community of Maricopa County, the impression is that Arizona will vote Democratic and turn blue for the first time in decades.
