## Discussion: Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing for Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett Day 3 - October 14, 2020 - Live 9:00 am ET

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb01ej/discussion_senate_judiciary_committee_hearing_for/):

> "This morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its hearings for the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The position became vacant following the death of the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September. This is President Trump's third Supreme Court nomination, following his nomination of Justice Gorsuch to replace the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, and his nomination of Justice Kavanaugh to replace Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy." Each Senator on the Judiciary Committee will have 30 minutes to question Judge Barrett. Chairman Lindsey Graham has scheduled a vote of the Judiciary Committee to follow on Friday.

> Graham again complaining that southern states don't get the same per capita contribution as NY, CA, and MA - *but those southern states refused the Medicaid expansion that came with the ACA. That's why they receive less funds!*

## Massachusetts' Republican governor 'cannot support Donald Trump for president'

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/943775/massachusetts-republican-governor-cannot-support-donald-trump-president):

> In a Wednesday statement, Gov. Charlie Baker declared through a spokesperson that he "Cannot support Donald Trump for president" and will "Leave the election analysis to the pundits." Baker didn't say whether he'd support Democratic nominee Joe Biden in turn. Baker is a moderate Republican who has been surprisingly popular in the deep blue state of Massachusetts throughout his last five years in office. He has maintained one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic, even topping Sen. Elizabeth Warren's support among Massachusetts Democrats in August.

> That's  how you govern as GOP in MA.

## ‘Stunned’: Amy Coney Barrett refuses to say she would keep birth control and same-sex marriage legal

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-hearing-birth-control-same-sex-marriage-b1041309.html):

> Conservative Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett refused to tell senators if she would vote to overturn decisions that provide legal protections to birth control and same-sex marriage, prompting one Democratic lawmaker to say her silence on those issues left him "Stunned." Ms Barrett told the senator she did not want to give people the impression that contraception soon will be illegal. She would not say whether she would have ruled with the majority in one case that upheld legal birth control.

`/u/accountabilitycounts` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb7bye/stunned_amy_coney_barrett_refuses_to_say_she/):

## NBC Staffers Seethe as Trump Gleefully Uses the Network Against Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/nbc-staffers-seethe-as-trump-gleefully-uses-the-network-against-biden):

> "The decision by NBC News to run a Trump town hall directly opposite ABC's Biden town hall is indefensible," he wrote. After Biden announced the ABC News town hall following the collapse of a proposed virtual debate, the Trump campaign began discussions with NBC News about its previous offer to host a presidential town hall. Ultimately, in 2020, NBC News' decision to host a Trump town hall directly opposite the Biden event has not sat well with staff at the news network and its cable-news sister MSNBC. "Everyone is upset," one network employee said.

`/u/Jwoom0818` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb8tsd/nbc_staffers_seethe_as_trump_gleefully_uses_the/):

> You know, I wasn’t planning on watching Biden’s townhall originally. But now I’m definitely going to be watching it!
