> You should do something about propaganda outlets like Breitbart, Townhall, TheFederalist, DailyCaller, DailyWire, The Washington Times (owned by a dangerous cult), etc.  
> 
> They are not reliable news outlets. And they are not notable.  They are literally propaganda that often advocate violence and hate and are pure misinformation.  There is no valid reason to keep them on the Whitelist.

Summary of [original article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/10/11/trump-is-the-most-crooked-president-in-american-history-that-should-matter/):

> Then on Saturday October 10th we learned the details of something even more damning that good government advocates have long suspected: Trump is actively selling access to special interests in exchange for personal gain. Once Mr. Trump was in the White House, his family business discovered a lucrative new revenue stream: people who wanted something from the president. Donald Trump is also hands down the most corrupt president in American history.

> This whole Presidency has been a test of the vaunted checks and balances of American democracy. Each and every one has been found faulty and wanting.
> 
> This election is the last safety valve, so make sure it doesn’t falter. VOTE.

## Banner flies over VP speech to Florida retirement community: ‘Pence is why you can’t see your grandkids’

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/banner-flies-over-vp-speech-to-florida-retirement-community-pence-is-why-you-cant-see-your-grandkids):

> As Mike Pence spoke to retirees in Florida on Saturday, a banner towed by a plane flew over his head: "Pence is why you can't see your grandkids." The vice president addressed members of The Villages, the nation's largest retirement community, warning the largely maskless crowd that the election would determine "Whether America remains America." It was not immediately clear who was behind the banner, which was captured on video. The Villages, usually a conservative stronghold, seems more and more contested territory in the 2020 election. On the same day as Pence's speech, a parade of golf carts carrying senior citizens headed towards the polls to drop off ballots for former Vice President Joe Biden.

`/u/CrizzyBill` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j9dsvh/banner_flies_over_vp_speech_to_florida_retirement/):

> Once again, something that flies just stole the show from Pence.

## Tax records show 200 entities funneled money to Trump properties while reaping benefits from White House: NYT

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/520549-tax-records-show-200-companies-groups-and-foreign-governments):

> Of tax records showed that more than 200 companies, special-interest groups and foreign governments have funneled millions of dollars to 's properties while reaping benefits from the president and his administration. The newspaper also used Trump's tax return data, lobbying disclosures, Freedom of Information Act requests and other public records to construct a database of groups, companies and governments that had business before the administration and spent money at Trump properties. The records and membership rosters for Mar-a-Lago and Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., also show how much money his business was making once he sat in the White House.
