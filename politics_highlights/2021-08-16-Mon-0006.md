> From the article:
> 
> Pompeo said it was "pathetic blame shifting" for Biden and White House officials to point out that they had inherited the peace deal from the Trump administration. The former Trump administration official argued that Biden had "utterly failed" by withdrawing the U.S. troops.
> 
> Wallace pushed back, pointing out that prominent military officials and leading Republicans had been highly critical of the deal made under Trump's and Pompeo's leadership.
> 
> "But I have to say, it isn't just President Biden who says this. When we announced that you were going to be a guest on this program, a former top military commander in Afghanistan and a current top Republican member of Congress both talked about the deal that the Trump administration and you negotiated back in 2020 with the Taliban, to pull out all U.S. forces," Wallace told Pompeo.
> 
> The Fox News host then played a clip of Trump defending the planned withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan while he was still president.
> 
> "Basically we're policemen right now. And we're not supposed to be policemen. We've been there for 19 years in Afghanistan. It's ridiculous," Trump said in that clip at the White House.
> 
> […]
> 
> "I just want to ask you one more question about your record though, sir," Wallace responded, pressing the issue. "You were the first American secretary of state to ever meet with the Taliban and you talked about how they had agreed to join us in the fight against terrorism."
> 
> The Fox News host then played a March 2020 clip of Pompeo saying that the Taliban had agreed to "work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and have [U.S. designated terrorist group] Al Qaeda depart from" Afghanistan.
> 
> "Do you regret giving the Taliban that legitimacy? Do you regret pressing the Afghan government to release 5,000 prisoners? Which they did, some of whom are now back on the battlefield fighting with the Taliban," Wallace asked Pompeo.
> 
> The former Trump administration official defended his record, saying "you make peace with your enemies." Pompeo remarked that his March 2020 statement "was absolutely true." 
> 
> ——————————
> 
> It’s nice to see Chris Wallace taking a Jon Stewart Daily Show approach, with clips and calling out the bullshit

> The fact that the Afghan government fell so quickly is proof enough that it was a house of cards all along. It’s painful to watch but getting out was still the right call. The big mistake is that it should have happened a long, long time ago.

## Mississippi Gov. Refuses School Mask Mandates, Compares Covid-19 in Kids to 'Sniffles'

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tate-reeves-covid-19-kids-1212475/):

> According to multiple sources who spoke to the Mississippi Free Press, Robinson had attended school for most of the week in a district where masks were allowed but not required until three days into the year, when the school reversed course after numerous students and staff tested positive. Although Reeves implemented a state-wide mask mandate for the last school year, he has resisted doing so again. Unlike some other Republican governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis and Texas's Greg Abbott, Reeves has not barred local governments or school districts from implementing their own mask mandates.

`/u/Randy_Watson` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p5344p/mississippi_gov_refuses_school_mask_mandates/):

> Dallas ran out of children’s ICU beds because of covid. But sure, it’s just the sniffles.

## Minnesota GOP rocked by top donor's sex trafficking scandal, as party chair faces calls to resign

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/08/15/minnesota-gop-rocked-by-top-donors-sex-trafficking-scandal-as-party-chair-faces-calls-to-resign/):

> The Republican Party of Minnesota was rocked this week by a scandal involving a top donor and conservative activist who was indicted for operating a child sex trafficking scheme, a sordid affair which also implicated an up-and-coming College Republican leader from the state. Lazzaro is also reportedly a close friend of state Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan, spurring calls for her resignation from a number of state lawmakers. The Minnesota College Republicans organization said Saturday that Gisela Castro Medina, the newly installed 19-year-old chair of the University of St. Thomas chapter, had been arrested in Florida Thursday alongside Lazzaro for "Obstruction of justice, sex trafficking, and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of underage victims."

> Not only is the GOP a death cult but they seem to be a Pedo Cult as well.
