## It’s Not Bipartisan Infrastructure Negotiation. It’s Time-Wasting Sabotage.

Summary of [original article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/06/20/its-not-bipartisan-infrastructure-negotiation-its-time-wasting-sabotage/):

> There is no reason that Democrats should be forced to sustain the political burden of passing unpopular federal gas tax increases that Republicans will then use as a populist billy club, rather than find other more progressive ways of covering infrastructure funding. There is no reason that today's long-suffering Democrats should allow COVID relief funds or unemployment insurance money to be taken to shoulder the burden of repairing infrastructure neglected by decades of selfish and shortsighted policy by Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats. There is no reason for Democrats to let Republicans chew up more and more of the legislative calendar, scuttling other major progressive priorities-especially when the likeliest outcome is that Republicans will once again play Lucy to Charlie Brown, pulling the football away from them once again at the last minute over manufactured excuses after wasting months of their time.

> It is waste of time because the parties are so far apart and the other party would be required to completely purge itself of Donald Trump and Trumpism. I can accept that  people can have radically different than I do, but what I cannot stand is willful, deliberate, and premeditated deception. And Trumpism is all about that.

## Sanders says no to gas taxes, electric vehicle fees to fund infrastructure deal

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/sanders-says-no-gas-taxes-electric-vehicle-fees-fund-infrastructure-n1271490):

> WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., drew his red lines on how to pay for a potential infrastructure compromise bill Sunday, as Democratic progressives continue to hesitate over joining the bipartisan deal on one of President Joe Biden's biggest legislative priorities. "One of the concerns that I do have about the bipartisan bill is how they are going to pay for their proposals, and they're not clear yet. I don't know that they even know yet, but some of the speculation is raising a gas tax, which I don't support, a fee on electric vehicles, privatization of infrastructure. Those are proposals that I would not support." " Portman said the bipartisan group is trying to use "Creative" solutions to avoid raising taxes and said that if Biden and other Democrats don't support the group's plan to index the gas tax to inflation, they should propose other ways to pay for the spending that don't raise taxes.

`/u/marxian_capitalist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o48owx/sanders_says_no_to_gas_taxes_electric_vehicle/):

> From a green perspective, indexing gas tax to inflation is a good idea. BUT, it's toughest on working class who can't afford to upgrade to electric or hybrids.
