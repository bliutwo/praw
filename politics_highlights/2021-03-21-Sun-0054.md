## AT&T and Cigna are funding Republican groups led by election objectors they had promised to stop supporting

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/list-sp-500-corporation-pac-pausing-contributions-electoral-college-objectors-2021-1):

> On January 6, Congress convened a joint session to formally certify President Joseph Biden's Electoral College victory, but it was quickly interrupted by a group of Republican objectors who argued, based on little more than conspiracy theories, that Congress shouldn't proceed because there had been widespread election fraud. Political Action Committees backed by S&P 500 companies gave more than $23 million to the 147 GOP election objectors during the most recent campaign cycles, according to an Insider analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. Here's a list of the S&P 500 companies - some of the largest and most influential businesses in the US - how much they gave to the 147 election objectors in the latest election cycles through their corporate PACs, and whether they've pulled their support.

## Ted Cruz falsely claimed Democrats want to give 'illegal aliens' and 'child molesters' the right to vote during a leaked invite-only call with GOP state lawmakers

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ted-cruz-falsely-claimed-democrats-want-let-illegal-aliens-vote-2021-3?r=US&IR=T):

> Sen. Ted Cruz falsely said Democrats want to let "Illegal aliens" and "Child molesters" vote. On an invitation-only call with GOP state lawmakers last week, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz falsely claimed Democrats are working to give "Illegal aliens" and "Child molesters" the right to vote, according to a recording of the call obtained by the Associated Press. "H.R. 1′s only objective is to ensure that Democrats can never again lose another election, that they will win and maintain control of the House of Representatives and the Senate and of the state legislatures for the next century," Cruz said on the call, according to AP. The legislation is unlikely to pass in the Senate, though the debate over voting rights is playing out in state legislatures across the country.

## Lindsey Graham Vows to Filibuster Voting Rights Bill Until He Collapses

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/lindsey-graham-vows-to-filibuster-voting-rights-bill-until-he-collapses/):

> Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said this week that if Senate Democrats revive the talking filibuster in an effort to weaken the rule's power as a tool of endless obstruction, he would speak until he "Fell over" to try to block passage of a major expansion of voting rights as well as legislation aiming to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. Brian Beutler, editor-in-chief of Crooked Media, added, "Change the filibuster rules so we can watch Lindsey Graham fall over." With momentum clearly on the side of diminishing the power of the filibuster - which is standing in the way of not just a major voting rights expansion, but also climate action, immigration reform, and more - Adam Jentleson of the Battle Born Collective said in an appearance on MSNBC Thursday that "It would be wise for senators to start thinking very seriously about whether or not we should just go ahead and do the reform now."

## ‘It’s not a local issue anymore’: D.C. statehood moves from political fringe to the center of the national Democratic agenda

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dc-statehood/2021/03/20/e7c7efb6-88ca-11eb-bfdf-4d36dab83a6d_story.html):

> Six years later, Joe Biden is himself the administration, with a Democratic majority in Congress behind him, and a fast-evolving political landscape has propelled D.C. statehood up the Democratic priority list after it passed the House for the first time last year. Sen. Thomas R. Carper, a close Biden ally who in January introduced the D.C. statehood bill in the Senate for the fifth consecutive Congress, said he has spoken multiple times with Biden about infrastructure but not about D.C. statehood. The D.C. mayor's office has gone national, too, spending the bulk of its $241,000 budget allocation for statehood initiatives on educational digital ads in those states plus Alaska, home of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is seen as a possible GOP vote for statehood.

`/u/Francis_Massacre` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/m9e6tz/its_not_a_local_issue_anymore_dc_statehood_moves/):

> In the preamble of the Constitution it clearly states that the government derives it's power and legitimacy from the "consent of the governed." For a group that makes such lip service to adhering to the Constitution and the nigh infallible wisdom of the founding fathers, conservatives seem to go through an inordinate amount of trouble ensure that large proportions of our population will never be in a position to genuinely participate in their own governance. The people in the D.C. and Puerto Rico (and other territories) as citizens have the right to participate in their own governance.
