## House Democrats call postmaster general to testify on USPS changes under Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/usps-postmaster-general-trump-18ddfd55-e47c-4439-ab76-78395e76fb85.html):

> The House Oversight Committee has asked Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, appointed by President Trump in May, to testify on Sept. 17 on changes made to the U.S. Postal Service under the Trump administration. Trump has railed against the reliability of mail-in voting and claimed, without evidence, that the election will be rigged if widespread mail-in ballots are allowed. What they're saying: "While these changes in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner-an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election," the committee wrote to DeJoy in a letter on July 20..

> I don't want to be the arrogant European here, but how is it possible that the rest of the civillized world is able to organize mail-voting without problems, but the US can't?
