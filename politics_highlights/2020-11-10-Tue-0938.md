## It's time to recognize the forgotten Americans who helped elect Joe Biden - Indigenous and Native American voters played a key role in Biden’s narrow margins in swing states

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/09/its-time-recognize-forgotten-americans-who-helped-elect-joe-biden/):

> In an election where a record-breaking six - yes, six - Native American and Native Hawaiian candidates were elected to Congress, and where Native voters in states like Arizona and Wisconsin may have helped tip the scales in President-elect Joe Biden's favor, it's critical Americans recognize the long history of the battles over Native citizenship, suffrage and representation. In his 1886 annual address, President Grover Cleveland pushed for a "More rapid transition from tribal organization to citizenship." In an era when federal Indian policy hinged on assimilation, citizenship was a means to accelerate the impact of legislation like the 1887 General Allotment Act, which Teddy Roosevelt called "a mighty pulverizing machine intended to break up the tribal mass." But the combination of citizenship - without the right to vote - deprived Native Americans of political power and inclusion in American politics. After Native voters in North Dakota helped elect Democrat Heidi Heitkamp to the Senate in 2012, the Republican-controlled legislature began requiring voters have IDs with a residential mailing address instead of a P.O. box.

> Edit: some people are responding with a "this is misleading" reply - this was never meant to imply that surface area = population. But in a state with razor thin margins, a group of rural voters (natives) voting pretty uniformly for Biden is largely what pushed it over the edge. If the entire rural area of the state was red, Biden probably doesn't win.

## As an ex-president, Trump could disclose the secrets he learned while in office, current and former officials fear

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-possible-security-risk/2020/11/09/f19c853e-229e-11eb-952e-0c475972cfc0_story.html):

> No new president has ever had to fear that his predecessor might expose the nation's secrets as President-elect Joe Biden must with Trump, current and former officials said. "Anyone who is disgruntled, dissatisfied or aggrieved is a risk of disclosing classified information, whether as a current or former officeholder. Trump certainly fits that profile," said David Priess, a former CIA officer and author of "The President's Book of Secrets," a history of the top-secret intelligence briefings that presidents and their staff receive while in office. A President Biden could refuse to give Trump any intelligence briefings, which ex-presidents have received before meeting with foreign leaders or embarking on diplomatic missions at the current president's request.

## Black organizations across Georgia put in the work to turn state blue

Summary of [original article](https://www.ajc.com/news/black-organizations-across-georgia-put-in-the-work-to-turn-state-blue/SEDPJADKOVDEFJX6AXQ7WGTIAI/):

> "We put in a lot of hard work and that hard work is reaping the rewards," said John Jackson, chairman of the DeKalb County Democratic Party, the first Black man to hold that position. Since at least 2018, organizations such as the Peoples' Agenda, Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight‚ Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project and even "Get Your Booty to the Poll," a campaign that rose out of Atlanta strip clubs, have been fighting against voter suppression and to increase the voter rolls, especially for Black and disenfranchised populations. Trump got about 18% of Black men across the country to vote for him and 8% of Black women.

## President Trump lost. Too many Republicans keep pretending he didn’t.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/president-trump-lost-too-many-republicans-keep-pretending-he-didnt/2020/11/09/01ff8684-22c6-11eb-952e-0c475972cfc0_story.html):

> MONDAY MARKED two days since the race for president was settled - two days since President Trump should have conceded and begun to cooperate with President-elect Joe Biden in an orderly transition. So-called leaders of the Republican Party, for four years the enablers of Mr. Trump's erosion of constitutional norms, are now enabling his dishonest slander against American democracy itself. Mr. Trump and his enablers are fueling fever dreams among Trump supporters on social media - that ballot-counting software secretly switched massive numbers of votes to Mr. Biden, or that Philadelphia vote counters tainted the tally beyond the view of election observers, or that the Supreme Court will throw out so many ballots that the president will still prevail.

> My mother is having a giant toddler meltdown over this on Facebook. It’s so embarrassing that she’s so deep into this cult that she literally believes anything he says. She barely speaks to me anymore because of Fox News and I’m part of the “radical liberal mob”. She actually called me a pedophile lover because of my vote for Biden. I hate these people for taking my mother away from me.
