Who are we looking for? We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes.

> How does Jon feel about legalizing marijuana in Georgia? Colorado has seen enormous economic benefit by legalizing. Georgia has a much larger population than Colorado and could arguably see a much larger economic bump by legalizing. 
> 
> Would Jon support legalizing marijuana and using the tax revenue to better fund education in Georgia? Or perhaps using the tax revenue to fund treatment programs for the meth and opiates problem in Georgia? 
> 
> Also, please let John know that I LOVED his response to Fox News. "Kelly Loeffler is campaigning with former Klansmen."

> Georgia... Mcconnel thinks they've done enough. Loeffler and Perdue agree. They care more about insider trading than they care about helping you get through the pandemic.

## Lindsey Graham pushes McConnell for separate vote on $2,000 checks

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/31/lindsey-graham-mcconnell-separate-vote-2-000-checks-453015):

> Schumer joined an effort from Sen. Lindsey Graham to press McConnell to allow a stand-alone vote on $2,000 stimulus checks in addition to Trump's demands for an election fraud commission and repealing tech protections for big tech companies. The House voted overwhelmingly on Monday to approve $2,000 stimulus checks. The president, Graham added, "Wants three things: a commission to investigate fraud, $2,000 checks, and to repeal Section 230. I'm urging Senator McConnell to give a stand-alone vote in the new Congress after January 3rd on all three measures."

## Republicans Have a Friend in the Company That Counts Their Votes. Raising Some Questions about the Voting Machine Company Behind So Many Surprise Wins This Year

Summary of [original article](https://www.dcreport.org/2020/12/31/ess-voting-systems-a-friend-to-republicans/):

> After initially focusing on the surprisingly lopsided results of the senatorial election in Kentucky, DCReport broadened our scope to look at the electronic vote-counting software and electronic voting systems that we rely on to tally our votes. In December 2019, Democratic lawmakers sought answers from those top three voting machine vendors which "Facilitate voting for over 90% of all eligible voters in the United States." In requesting details about the ownership of ES&S, the lawmakers specifically noted, "We are particularly concerned that secretive and 'trouble-plagued companies,' owned by private equity firms and responsible for manufacturing and maintaining voting machines and other election administration equipment, 'have long skimped on security in favor of convenience,' leaving voting systems across the country 'prone to security problems'."

`/u/Whatthefucksupdennys` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/knsykv/republicans_have_a_friend_in_the_company_that/):

> Oh shit. Projection! I almost forgot about the GOPs go to strategy.

## Trump Has Spent Nearly a Quarter of His Presidency on the Golf Course

Summary of [original article](https://www.mic.com/p/trump-has-spent-nearly-a-quarter-of-his-presidency-on-the-golf-course-53386133):

> While I'm not certain whether or not Donald Trump actually enjoys being president all that much, he sure has embraced the spirit, if not the literal definition, of never working a day in his life. As the country - and the world at large - counts down the hours until we can all put 2020 in our rearview mirror, and hopefully move on to bigger and better things in 2021, Trump has spent the holiday season at his Mar-a-Lago resort, pointedly contradicting the White House's declaration that the he would "Continue to work tirelessly for the American people" by juggling "Many meetings and calls" and instead retreating to his safest of safe spaces: a golf course he owns. Incredibly, despite spending nearly every fourth day golfing, Trump actually spent more than a quarter of his term in office at one of his private properties, which means there were evidently days where the president just sort of ... hung out at home.

`/u/MasterKenshi13` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/knq61q/trump_has_spent_nearly_a_quarter_of_his/):

> One year, he’s spent almost 1 full year of his presidency golfing.

## ‘She’s ‘been campaigning with a Klansman’: Ossoff hits back at Loeffler’s criticism of Warnock

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/warnock-loeffler-georgia-osoff-runoff-b1780874.html):

> Rev Warnock also released a statement expressing skepticism at Sen Loeffler's campaign's response saying the senator "Runs a campaign based on dividing and misleading Georgians." Neither Sen Loeffler nor Rev Warnock's campaign immediately responded to The Independent's request for further comment. The Georgia runoff elections will place in Georgia on 5 January 2021, and could determine which party holds power of the senate.

`/u/NoFascist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/knr3w4/shes_been_campaigning_with_a_klansman_ossoff_hits/):

> He said it three times. Each one a bit more perfect.
