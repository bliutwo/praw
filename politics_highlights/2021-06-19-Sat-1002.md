> It’s achieved exactly what it set out to achieve. Hundreds of thousands in private for profit prisons, millions more ineligible to vote due to having a record and communities destroyed because people aren’t able to get employment. It’s was never a war on drugs, that’s just a convenient name, it’s a war on minority/marginalised communities and people who challenge the powers that be.

## Trump Commerce Boss Wilbur Ross Hoovered Up $53 Million While In Public Office | Then he slipped out of public life and into a business he set up in the Cayman Islands while reportedly still commerce secretary

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wilbur-ross-53-million-commerce-head-finance-report_n_60cd5ceae4b01af0c2706d30):

> Donald Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, earned at least $53 million from private companies while he was collecting a taxpayer salary and supposed to be looking out for the public instead of his own profits. Ross reported making somewhere between $53 million and $127 million during his four years as head of the Commerce Department. News of Ross' income while serving in the Trump administration follows a bombshell report in The Washington Post last month that an "Obscure" security office within the Commerce Department served as an aggressive "Counterintelligence unit," collecting information on hundreds of Americans, including the department's own employees.

> Honestly, I feel the term "corruption" gets thrown around too freely, with public office holders often accused of corruption with little or no evidence they have done anything illegal, unethical, or an actual corruption of policy or power.
> 
> This however, if true, is *corrupt as fuck*.

> Mandatory arbitration clauses are heinous in general. They basically lock you out of the "real" court system, and force you to use a kangaroo court that's been bought and paid for by the person you are trying to sue.  
> 
> The people that write these contracts know that perfectly well, and it's the reason mandatory arbitration clauses are so common.  Everyone deserves access to the court system for any legitimate issue.

## Mark Meadows reportedly predicted 'nobody is going to care' about George Floyd's killing

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/mark-meadows/1001717/mark-meadows-reportedly-predicted-nobody-is-going-to-care-about-george-floyds):

> Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reportedly initially dismissed the idea that George Floyd's killing would dominate the news and generate nationwide outrage in May 2020, instead thinking "Nobody" would care. The scheduled topic was the COVID-19 pandemic, but adviser Jared Kushner, who appeared "Distracted" and "Aloof," reportedly interrupted the discussion to bring up the video starting to spread of Floyd's killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Former President Donald Trump watched the video of Floyd's killing the following day, according to the book, and he reportedly "Looked repulsed" and turned away before it was finished, telling aides "This is f--ing terrible" and commenting that "These f--ing cops" can "Get out of control sometimes."

## New emails show Trump team pressured government officials to overturn election result | Former president urged Justice Department officials to go to the Supreme Court with similar claims from widely rejected spurious lawsuits

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-emails-election-voter-fraud-b1866389.html):

> In the weeks after the 2020 presidential election and his definitive loss, Donald Trump repeatedly pressured officials at the US Department of Justice to pursue baseless allegations of voter fraud and election-related conspiracy theories, newly-released emails reveal. Previously reported emails from Mr Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows also reveal his attempts to substantiate QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories and other debunked election fraud narratives, including emailing a link to a YouTube video to Justice Department officials about US election data compromised by Italian intelligence in coordination with the CIA. Emails show that Mr Rosen resisted calls to look into the Italy conspiracy theory or speak with Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's personal lawyer, who pursued a spurious legal campaign to suppress millions of Americans' votes. "These documents show that President Trump tried to corrupt our nation's chief law enforcement agency in a brazen attempt to overturn an election that he lost," Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement.

`/u/8to24` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o3f5l5/new_emails_show_trump_team_pressured_government/):

> Enough with the damn emails, LMFAO. We all saw Trump on the White House lawn telling supporters the election was stolen, to be upset about it, and go to the capital. We all heard audio of Trump's call to the GA governor demanding he overturn his own states election. Trump desperately attempted to interfere. We all know this. Emails are probably the weakest evidence.
