## Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw told supporters Trump lost to Biden. The Republican was heckled and called a RINO.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/13/dan-crenshaw-heckled-bobby-piton/):

> In Piton's video description section on YouTube, his campaign called Crenshaw a RINO, meaning a Republican in name only, a political slur used against GOP officials not considered conservative enough. The campaign lumped in Crenshaw with others Piton considers RINOs: Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, two Republican members of Congress who voted to impeach Trump because of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. On Twitter, Piton went further, saying Crenshaw - who served as a Navy SEAL and lost an eye in a bomb explosion in Afghanistan - seemed to be "Crossing over to traitor status."

## Texas' largest school district defies governor, approves mask mandate for students

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-largest-school-district-defies-governor-approves-mask-mandate-students-n1276749):

The superintendent for Houston Independent School District said this week that he planned on imposing an order that required all students, staff, and visitors to wear masks on district property and buses. The mask requirements for students are in defiance of an executive order that Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, issued in May barring school districts, as well other government entities, from mandating masks.
