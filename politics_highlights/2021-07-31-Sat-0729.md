## How Trump’s ‘World of Bullshit’ Unleashed Today’s Delta Surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-trumps-world-of-bullshit-unleashed-todays-delta-hell):

> Harry Siegel: As a vaccinated person, how concerned should I be given the new CDC guidance about getting COVID? And how concerned should I be about spreading COVID? We have a situation in the United States where we have 100 million people or so who have never had the disease, and who have never been vaccinated and who are vulnerable to getting infected by a vaccinated person who's contracted the Delta variant. In America, we're in a much more complicated new phase where we have to figure out how we're going to maximize the number of people who are actually vaccinated.

> > The third thing is that Donald Trump did a terrific job of undermining science, and undermining the credibility of statements from scientists. So that now, there’s inherent skepticism. Every misstep in terms of communications tends to exacerbate this terrible anti-science legacy left by the former president. So we have what Trump has done intentionally to undermine the credibility of science, coupled with the fact that we keep learning new data.
> 
> So Trump has vaccinated hundreds of millions against the truth, ensuring that the pandemic’s impact is extended and multiplied. Putin could not have played it better.

## 3 GOP Congressmen face ethics complaints for failing to disclose $22 million in stock trades

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/07/30/3-gop-congressmen-face-ethics-complaints-for-failing-to-disclose-22-million-in-stock-trades/):

> Three Congressional Republicans were accused of violating a federal ethics law through their prolific stock trading, according to complaints filed by a watchdog group Friday. Tommy Tuberville, Pat Fallon and Blake Moore all reportedly failed to disclose dozens of trades worth up to $22 million within the 45 days mandated by a 2012 law called the STOCK Act, which was intended to fight conflicts of interest by lawmakers. The number of ethics complaints related to Congressional stock trading has grown over the last few years - and is one of the rare areas of Washington, D.C. where bipartisanship still reigns.

> Yes, call it the coup, because it is one, but do not think it to have failed. [The Republican coup he started is still underway and on track for success. ](https://demandusdemocracy.org/articles/the-republican-plot-to-undo-american-democracy-is-on-track-for-success) 
> 
> Republicans across the country are abusing their power to rig elections in favor of their party. This model of undemocratic takeover is popular with authoritarians around the world right now  because it allows anti-democracy parties to seize power through means which are technically entirely legal. Due to this, and the fact that certain features of a democracy are left intact, resistance from citizens to these coups tends to be confused, dampened, and often too late. But it’s not too late for us, not nearly. We need to spread the word about what Republicans are doing and begin organizing a full scale movement for democracy should Republicans continue this electoral coup. We cannot afford tolerate election cheaters. They must be delegitimized and forced from power through a campaign of strategic nonviolence. These are frightening times for American democracy, but we have the opportunity to emerge from this with stronger democratic systems than ever before. But it is going to take a lot of hard work to get us there.

> > **18 USC § 610 makes it a crime “for any person to…attempt to** intimidate, threaten, **command**, or coerce, **any employee of the Federal Government…to engage in**, or not to engage in, **any political activity**”. Does former President’s misconduct violate this law? We’re looking into it.
> 
> > The notes taken by Richard Donoghue, then Rosen's deputy who was on the call, state that Trump had said: "**Just say the election was corrupt** and leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen."

> 
> Conservatives only have one way out of this and that’s to just deny reality.  Republicans knew what Trump was trying to do.

## Jan. 6 committee faces unprecedented choice of whether to call Republican lawmakers to testify

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/31/january-6-committee-witnesses/):

> Thompson said the panel will be seeking the White House telephone and visitor logs to further scrutinize which members were in touch with the White House on Jan. 6."I would say between noon and 6 p.m., any call that went to the White House, you assume had to be something that had to do with it," he said. "I don't recall a case where members of Congress were subpoenaed to an oversight hearing," said Stanley Brand, an expert on congressional ethics investigations and the former House counsel from 1976 to 1983.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Jim Jordan have been the recent subject of questions about what members could be called to appear before the select committee. Jessica Levinson, director of Loyola Law School's public service institute, said the fact that there is even a discussion about whether a member's role or relevance to an assault on Congress can be used to force them to testify reflects the breakdown in political norms since Trump was elected and the divisiveness that now accompanies even something as seemingly unifying as investigating a violent attack on the Capitol.
