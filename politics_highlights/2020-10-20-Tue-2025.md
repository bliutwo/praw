## The Trump Campaign Reportedly Blew $1 Billion on Private Jets, Trump Properties, and Don Jr.’s Shitty Book

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/trump-campaign-cash-woes):

> In reality, he was a total failure who put six companies into bankruptcy and only did well playing the part of a successful businessman on TV. Of course, Trump never told supporters that their savior nearly went broke due to a series of very bad business decisions, just like his campaign hasn't tweeted about the fact that it's strapped for cash after blowing most of its money on legal fees, Trump properties, private jet rides, and his eldest son's book. On Monday, the firm Medium Buying reported Trump was canceling ads in Wisconsin; Minnesota, which Trump had hoped to flip; and Ohio, which went for Trump in 2016 but now appears to be a tight contest. Parscale reportedly purchased "a fleet of luxury vehicles"; surrogates were flown on private jets; and it wouldn't be a Trump operation if the candidate wasn't charging his own campaign to stay at his properties to the tune of more than $7.4 million since 2017.

> My favorite part is that he spent over $1 million on ad buys in DC just so he could watch himself on TV.

Summary of [original article](https://god.dailydot.com/women-confront-lindsey-graham/?fbclid=IwAR2QrzoQ7fYzk2XMushWDHty3UL0G0Iq3QG1NTb2pD6UgW4tbPazN0naiCg):

> Two women spotted Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia on Monday and confronted him for his work pushing Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court. Graham posted video of the encounter himself and called the women "Hostile & unhinged" for daring to speak with him in public. Graham and his cronies continue to hustle up the escalator and through the airport as fast as they can, almost as though they're afraid of these two ladies asking them questions.
