## Shouldn’t Ted Cruz Be in Quarantine Right Now?

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/ted-cruz-disaster-relief-photos-criticized-after-mexico-trip.html):

> On Thursday, Senator Ted Cruz was seen in the Cancún International Airport, hopping on a flight back to Houston after his apparent plans for a little vacation - as a massive, weather-related crisis engulfed his state - reached the media. On Saturday, Cruz was seen shaking hands and loading water bottles into cars in Texas. Shortly after news of the getaway broke, Cruz offered that he had been dropping off his daughters, who wanted to go on a vacation because school had been canceled.

> Ben Shapiro said 'There's nothing he can do anyways..." In a way Ben's right, because Ted doesn't think about actually making a difference. She raised $2 mil got off her ass and went down there to soup kitchen. Any republican who talks smack on that is daft.

## ‘Where is Greg Abbott?’ Anger grows at Texas governor in deadly storm’s wake

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/where-is-greg-abbott-anger-grows-at-texas-governor/2021/02/21/86324e54-72d6-11eb-b8a9-b9467510f0fe_story.html):

> Critics have charged that Abbott and his administration failed to take the storm's threat seriously or issue sufficient emergency warnings throughout - with meteorologists giving ample warning of a serious storm that could bring record cold, cause power demand to spike, and threaten electrical infrastructure more than a week in advance. Several prominent Democrats are eyeing the race, and a group of liberal activists - some of whom worked on former congressman Beto O'Rourke's 2018 Senate campaign - started a political action committee last year called the Beat Abbott PAC."Short term, I am absolutely certain that the governor's popularity will suffer as a result of this," said Bill Hammond, a Republican lobbyist and former head of the Texas Association of Business. Matt Mackowiak, chairman of the Travis County Republican Party, said that although Abbott should have done more to communicate with Texans in the early hours of the crisis, he expects they remain comforted that Abbott is in charge, citing his judicial temperament and reputation for scrutinizing briefing books and legislative reports.

> Governor Abbott is using the Trump playbook to do nothing; ignore all problems and responsibilities; let people suffer and die; nothing matters except staying in power and living a parasitic life at the expense of taxpayers.

## Charlie Crist asks DOJ to investigate DeSantis’ pop-up vaccine sites for wealthy Florida neighborhoods

Summary of [original article](http://www.wfla.com/news/florida/charlie-crist-asks-doj-to-investigate-desantis-pop-up-vaccine-sites-for-wealthy-florida-neighborhoods):

> US Representative Charlie Crist announced Sunday he has sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson, asking that the US Department of Justice investigate concerns surrounding Governor Ron DeSantis' decision to establish vaccination sites in wealthy neighborhoods, such as Lakewood Ranch. I write with concern about reports that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is establishing coronavirus vaccine distribution and administration sites in select locations to benefit political allies and donors, over the needs of higher risk communities and existing county waitlists. In several cases, these sites seem to be targeted to wealthy communities with whom Governor DeSantis has clear political connections, allowing some to skip to the front of the line in counties with existing waitlists.

`/u/reddicyoulous` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lpaudt/charlie_crist_asks_doj_to_investigate_desantis/):

> >“Time and time again, Governor DeSantis has proven he is not up to the task of leading our state out of this pandemic as he continues to play politics with the health and well-being of vulnerable Floridians,” said Crist. “So far, over 30,000 Floridians have died and at least 1.8 million more have gotten sick, with minority communities and seniors hit the hardest. Instead of prioritizing people most at risk, the Governor has chosen – during the worst pandemic in a century – to help out his friends and donors. That is why I’m calling on the Department of Justice to investigate.”

> Well said

## State of Texas should pay for enormous energy bills after power outages, Houston mayor says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/21/texas-storm-houston-mayor-says-state-of-texas-should-pay-for-high-energy-bills.html):

> Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner on Sunday called on the state of Texas to pay for the enormous electric bills that scores of Texans reported after severe winter weather knocked out power and rose energy prices. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages power for roughly 90% of the state, was unprepared for the cold conditions and the surge in demand for power as people tried to heat their homes. After more than 3 million people in Texas lost power last week, ERCOT said it's returned to normal conditions and restored power for millions of customers.

> I am aware Houston is liberal. It wont matter since this disaster hit across all of TX. No matter how ‘red’ the person, county or city is, they will demand bailout money.
