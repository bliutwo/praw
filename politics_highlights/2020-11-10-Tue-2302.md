> Nov. 10 - Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified Tuesday that the bureau had reason to believe President Donald Trump was a threat to national security as he defended its investigation into the president and his campaign's alleged links to Russia. Appearing before the Senate judiciary committee, McCabe cited Trump's decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 after he refused to close an investigation into Trump's then-national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Graham asked McCabe who was "Responsible for ruining Carter Page's life" to which McCabe responded, "We are all responsible for the work that went into that [warrant]."
