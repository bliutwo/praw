## Republicans treated Covid like a bioweapon. Then it turned against them

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/07/republicans-treated-covid-like-bioweapon-turned-against-them):

> At the outset of the pandemic, as Seattle and New York City became hard hit, Republicans apparently imagined that the pandemic would strike Democratic states and cities first, and certainly in 2020 Black, Latinx and indigenous people were disproportionately affected. To put it clearly, Republicans enabled a campaign of mass death and disablement, thinking it would be primarily mean death and illness for those they regarded as opponents. Measuring the impact of the pandemic by its death toll leaves out other impacts that matter: millions of schoolchildren isolated and undereducated, millions of parents exhausted by double duty, millions of small businesses shuttered, millions unemployed and impoverished, their dreams crushed, millions isolated and anxious, millions grieving the dead. Medical workers who were selflessly heroic the first time around are demoralized now that the hospitalised are so often people who could have been vaccinated, could have been careful, but chose not to.

`/u/Parkimedes` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oztu49/republicans_treated_covid_like_a_bioweapon_then/):

> This hits the nail on the head. It’s clearly what was happening last year, especially when it was mainly coastal cities being hit and hit hard. Someone in a GOP leadership position decided to make a stand against dealing with the pandemic seriously for political gain of the Republican Party. And they simply taped their feet to the bicycle and now they can’t get off. There is no moment when a critical mass of republicans will be in favor of switching attitudes simultaneously. Instead they will believe whatever they have to, in order to back up their narrative, which is that democrats are the real threat not Covid.

> In order for people to believe such insanity, they will be driven insane themselves. And it’s very hard to win an argument against an insane person. Welcome to America.

## Records Show Defendant in ‘Ghost' Candidate Case Worked for Powerful GOP Operative

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/records-show-defendant-in-ghost-candidate-case-worked-for-powerful-gop-operative/2523316/):

> Prosecutors in the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office accuse former Republican state senator Frank Artiles of offering third-party candidate Alex Rodriguez nearly $45,000 to run last November to siphon votes away from the democratic candidate with the same last name. A former Florida state senator has been arrested and accused of violating state election laws related to his alleged support of a bogus candidate in a legislative race. State campaign finance records show Bainter's company is a major player in state politics.

> When the consequences for this "dirty trick" politics come so far after the election and does not cause the election to be redone then why would the GOP stop using these tactics?  
> 
> They just stole another election for another 4 years at the fist of one operative maybe... maybe facing some sort of criminal consequence?

## Secret Donors To Nonprofit Pushing Trump's “Big Lie” Election Conspiracy Revealed

Summary of [original article](https://theintercept.com/2021/08/07/election-fraud-bradley-impact-fund-donors/):

> Like the larger group, the Bradley Impact Fund has given money to groups that promote election fraud conspiracies and sought to overturn President Donald Trump's 2020 election defeat. A much larger, linked nonprofit, the Bradley Foundation was identified by a recent New Yorker article as "An extraordinary force in persuading mainstream Republicans to support radical challenges to election rules." The report described the foundation as a key promoter of the idea that election outcomes unfavorable to Trump are the result of fraud, doling out millions in grants to projects in the United States aimed at disqualifying purportedly illegitimate voters from participating in elections, according to the New Yorker, while using the issue of election integrity as a way of both undermining faith in the democratic process and manipulating election outcomes in a manner more favorable to candidates aligned with Trumpism. According to tax filings for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Bradley Impact funded some of the same organizations funded by the Bradley Foundation - groups that constitute a network of election fraud conspiracists and undertook legal efforts to overthrow the 2020 election.

> >ACCORDING TO TAX filings for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Bradley Impact funded some of the same organizations funded by the Bradley Foundation — groups that constitute a network of election fraud conspiracists and undertook legal efforts to overthrow the 2020 election. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, identified by the New Yorker as “leading the way” in attempts to nullify the 2020 election, was given more than $300,000 by Bradley Impact over the two tax years. Bradley Impact also funded at least three right-wing groups that have promoted election fraud conspiracies: Turning Point USA, Project Veritas, and the Heritage Foundation.

## Dozens of items given to Trump's State Department are reportedly missing from the agency's gift vault

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/dozens-of-items-missing-from-state-departments-gift-vault-politico-2021-8):

> Dozens of items went missing from the State Department's gift vault during the transition from the Trump to Biden administrations, Politico reported Friday. Two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told Politico foreign affairs correspondent Nahal Toosi that at least 20 types of individual pieces are missing and there the State Department's inspector general is investigating the disappearances. State Department officials are currently looking for a $5,800 bottle of Japanese whisky given to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by the Japanese government in 2019, according to public notice filings on Wednesday.

## COVID-19 is crushing red states. Why isn’t Trump turning his rallies into mass vaccination sites?

Summary of [original article](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/29/covid-19-is-crushing-red-states-why-isnt-trump-turning-his-rallies-into-mass-vaccination-sites/):

> Three states, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania are swing states that went for Biden in 2020 and the remaining eight states are Republican strongholds. In Republican states, increases in COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths could be affecting Black residents, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic, even in Republican stronghold states. In a final irony, Congressman-elect Jake Ellzey will replace Rep. Ron Wright who died of COVID. Historically, rational political calculus has been a bipartisan quality, but not in the Trumpified GOP. If Trump wants to preserve the lives of his best voters, he would turn his rallies into mass vaccination sites.

`/u/black_flag_4ever` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oztnto/covid19_is_crushing_red_states_why_isnt_trump/):

> Because he doesn’t care about them.
