## Justice Department to sue Georgia over sweeping voting restrictions

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-voting-law-lawsuit-biden-b1872859.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1624632742):

> The US Department of Justice will sue the state of Georgia over the passage of an elections law with far-reaching restrictions on voting, marking the first major challenge under President Joe Biden against a nationwide voter suppression campaign in Republican-dominated state legislatures. "Justifications proffered in support of post-election audits and restrictions on voting have relied on allegations of voting fraud in the 2020 election that have been refuted by every court, federal and state, that has considered them," Mr Garland said earlier this month. The Justice Department announcement comes just days after Senate Republicans blocked a voting rights bill that would create national standards for mail-in and early voting, automatically register eligible voters, end partisan gerrymandering, and expose "Dark money" donors in campaign fundraising, among other measures.

> This is bigger than people think. This will help set a precedence that will hopefully prevent more states from adopting voting practices like this. It's time to make election day a federal holiday or extend voting over 2-3 days.

> Former President Donald Trump wanted a heavy-handed, violent and aggressive response to civil rights protesters who took to the streets nationwide following the police killing of George Floyd last year, according to a new book. Trump reportedly told advisers that he wanted the military to "Beat the fuck" out of the mostly peaceful demonstrators, according to an excerpt from Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender's "'Frankly, We Did Win This Election': The Inside Story Of How Trump Lost" that was published by CNN on Thursday. "Just shoot them," Trump reportedly repeatedly demanded.

## Top US Gen. Mark Milley told Stephen Miller to 'shut the f---up' when he said BLM protests were turning US cities into war zones, book says

> One of America's top generals told Stephen Miller to "Shut the f-- up" after the Trump advisor suggested that protesters had turned US cities into war zones, a new book reportedly says. President Donald Trump, Miller, Attorney General Bill Barr, and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were clashing over how to respond to the unrest, the book said, according to CNN. During one debate in the Oval Office, Bender reportedly wrote, Miller said the protests reminded him of a war zone. "That's how you're supposed to handle these people," Trump told top officials, Bender reportedly wrote.

## Tucker Carlson calls Gen. Milley 'a pig' for critical race theory comments

`/u/Abraham_Ittermann` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o7lxsd/tucker_carlson_calls_gen_milley_a_pig_for/):

> Kneeling during the national anthem is "disrespectful" to our troops. But literally calling them "pigs" is totally not. And this is because conservatives are good people with valid points and most definitely not a fascistic nationalist white supremacist party built around a cult of personality centered on a self-proclaimed strongman with open disdain for democracy and equality. And there's nowhere in history where we've seen this before, so there's no reason to be alarmed by what we're seeing when what we're seeing almost perfectly parallels those circumstances that didn't happen. So this is fine and it makes sense and there's no reason to be upset.

## 'Coward' Tucker Carlson Torched For Calling Top U.S. General 'A Pig' And 'Stupid'

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_60d54170e4b00bad2be5af65):

> Fox News host Tucker Carlson slung mud at Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, on Thursday evening, calling him "a pig" and "Stupid" after the Army general defended the teaching of critical race theory in the military a day earlier. "Mark Milley is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff," the conservative personality said on "Tucker Carlson Tonight." "He didn't get that job because he's brilliant or because he's brave, or because people who know him respect him. He is not, and they definitely don't." Ted Lieu June 25, 2021 Best way to understand Tucker Carlson's abuse of General Mark Milley tonight is as confirmation of the accuracy of the stories Gen Milley told about rebuffing ex President Trump's order for a massacre in Portland, Oregon.

`/u/jayc428` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o7hay5/coward_tucker_carlson_torched_for_calling_top_us/):

> General Milley did tours in Panama, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He’s an Army Ranger who served in the 82nd Airborne, later commanded the entire 101st Airborne. He also has graduated from not one but two Ivy League colleges. He’s served the country with distinction for 41 years and he’s been awarded multiple times for meritorious service. 
> 
> Tucker Carlson got kicked out of a boarding school in Switzerland, has just a bachelors degree in history from a tiny college in Connecticut. His application to the CIA was denied. Went into journalism because his father said “They’ll take anybody”. The only thing interesting about him is his stupid name. 
> 
> General Milley > Tucker Carlson
