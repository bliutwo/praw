> The [NYT supercut video](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/style/police-protests-video.html) of the secret police showed a number of different obscure or unrecognizable patches on some troops, and some individuals even had different ID patches on their own left and right arms. 
> 
> There’s no way for a protester, or even a bystander, to know if they’re being assaulted by police, military, Erik Prince mercenaries, or right wing terrorist yahoos. Which is intentional, because for Trump to get his fascist crackdown he needs the peaceful protesters to fight back.

## Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-lose-presidential-election-joe-biden-uk-boris-johnson-2020-7):

> The UK government is privately "Desperate" for Donald Trump to lose the upcoming presidential election and be replaced by Joe Biden, according to a report by the Sunday Times. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is publicly one of Trump's closest international allies. The president reportedly slammed the phone down on Johnson in a moment of "Apoplectic" fury in January, when Johnson initially refused to scrap the UK's deal with Huawei to help develop Britain's 5G network.

> Every country except Russia, China, and NK are desperate for Biden to win. Your government is the laughing stock of the entire world.

## 'It’s my constitutional freaking right': Black Americans arm themselves in response to pandemic, protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/26/black-americans-gun-owners-380162):

> Sensationalized stereotypes about Black Americans and guns are also being used by critics of the anti-racism protests to justify a security crackdown in urban areas, many with large Black communities. The influx of interest in gun owning - and seeking membership in Black gun owner organizations - began as soon as the pandemic set in. Leaders of other Black gun ownership organizations echo this response, saying the spike owes to a range of concerns many Black Americans have.

## Roger McNamee: ‘Facebook is a threat to whatever remains of democracy in the US’

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/26/roger-mcnamee-facebook-is-a-threat-to-whatever-remains-of-democracy-in-the-us):

> Does Facebook have too much power?The scale of internet platforms such as Google and Facebook is unprecedented in the tech world and, I would argue, unprecedented since the Dutch East India Company. Is there a risk for Facebook in aligning itself closely with Trump?The trick when you're doing political lobbying is not to take up a position so extreme that if your side loses you can't come back from it. The value system of internet platforms, but especially Facebook, is a threat to whatever remains of democracy in the US. If Biden wins in 2020, do you think he'll make any attempt to reform or regulate these platforms?I wrote an open letter that was published in Wired.

`/u/CatalyticDragon` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hy4e11/roger_mcnamee_facebook_is_a_threat_to_whatever/):

> It's not Facebook it's a total lack of regulation pertaining to the willful and knowing dissemination of disinformation - otherwise known as *propaganda.* You might remember this as the stuff the Nazis used to push nationalism and vilify immigrants. 
> 
> The problem existed with Fox News well before FaceBook appeared and will continue on other platforms like OAN long after FaceBook is gone. 
> 
> Without some form of journalistic standards, truth in news media regulations, and media literacy classes in schools the US shall remain utterly ruined by this problem to the benefit of oligarchs both domestic and foreign.
