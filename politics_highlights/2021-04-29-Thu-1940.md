## Many Republican voters agree with Biden - 'trickle-down economics' has failed

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/many-republican-voters-agree-with-biden-trickle-down-economics-has-failed-2021-04-29/):

> In his speech to Congress on Wednesday night, Biden attacked trickle-down economics as an idea that has never worked. A 2020 study by the London School of Economics of 50 years of data from 18 countries showed that the only significant effect of significant tax cuts to the rich was to increase income inequality with little benefit to unemployment or economic growth. According to the Ipsos poll, 51% of adults agreed with the statement that "Trickle-down economics have never worked in America," while 26% disagreed.

> Before Reagan was elected, 'middle class' was defined as one job taking care of a family of four.  In those days $1 million was considered a giant fortune.  By the time Bush Sr. left office, 'middle class' was two jobs to keep the family going, and $1 million was what a rich guy paid for a party.

## Republicans Can Govern Without Winning a Majority. That Threatens Our Entire Democracy

Summary of [original article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/republicans-can-govern-without-winning-a-majority-that-threatens-our-entire-democracy/):

> In the United States, the deck is often stacked to favor Republicans. In the U.S. Senate, House and other institutions, Republicans can govern without winning the most votes, effectively allowing minority rule.

`/u/mf-TOM-HANK` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n18ugi/republicans_can_govern_without_winning_a_majority/):

> Ever since the 2010 redistricting, the Republicans have won seats in the House disproportionately to actual votes won.

## GOP senator says â€˜America is not a racist countryâ€™ after listing all the rampant racism he's experienced

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/tim-scott-america-not-racist-country-video/):

> In last night's GOP response to President Joe Biden's joint address to Congress, Sen. Tim Scott declared that "America is not a racist country" shortly after claiming that he'd been racially profiled and called racist slurs. "Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country," Scott continued. "'America is not a racist country,' says Tim Scott, a US senator who once revealed he was stopped by police seven times in one year," reporter Helen Kennedy tweeted.

`/u/danman2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n17s5b/gop_senator_says_america_is_not_a_racist_country/):

> Tim Scott: "We are not a racist nation. It is just a strange coincidence that in the span of 40 years, I am the only Black American to represent the Republican Party in the U.S. Senate."
> 
> EDIT: "Also the Republican Party freed the slaves and the Democrats belonged to the KKK. I do not want to discuss anything after 1960. Or how JFK/LBJ sponsored major civil rights legislation and how the 1964 Republican Presidential nominee (Barry Goldwater) was a segregationist that voted against that Civil Rights legislation. I also do not want to discuss the Southern Strategy that was used to convince disgruntled pro-segregationist southern whites to start voting Republican. I also do not want to discuss how the Republican Party's base engages in hero worship of the Confederacy and flies their flag. Or how the Republican Party consistently blocks police oversight reform that would help stop the killing of black men by police officers."

## California could be the 1st state to allow adults to add parents to health care plans

Summary of [original article](https://abc7.com/10557130/?ex_cid=TA_KABC_FB&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+New+Content+%28Feed%29&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR0vMdBRjSeMmssUzlF0FvofKN7Y9MuPWKCr9bvYUQeHq4dAC57taXVjnMw):

> SACRAMENTO, Calif. - California could become the only state to let adult children add their parents as dependents to their health insurance plans, a policy proposal aimed at increasing insurance coverage among low-income people living in the country illegally who aren't eligible for government-funded coverage. Supporters have framed the bill as a way to increase health care coverage among the state's uninsured population, which is made up mostly of people who are living in the country illegally and are not eligible for government-funded insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare. Lara's office dismissed that concern, saying "This is always an argument that is raised whenever we expand health care options." Since 2016, California's Medicaid program has covered children living in the United States illegally.

> Just fucking make universal health care happen and we will not have to deal with this type of shit.

`/u/Twoweekswithpay` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n1fgtd/number_of_children_held_in_border_patrol/):

> > The number of unaccompanied migrant children held in jail-like conditions by US Customs and Border Protection dropped nearly 84% in the span of a month, according to a White House official, underscoring the significant progress made by the administration after reaching record high custody figures.
> 
> > As of Wednesday, there were 954 children in CBP facilities, down from a peak of 5,767 on March 28, the official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the record. [...]
> 
> > The average time that kids are in CBP custody is now 28 hours, compared to 133 hours on March 28, the official said, a nearly 80% reduction in time spent in Border Patrol detention.
