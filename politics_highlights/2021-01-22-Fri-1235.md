## Bernie Sanders Is Right, and Joe Biden Is Wrong. We Still Need Medicare for All.

Summary of [original article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/01/bernie-sanders-biden-administration-medicare-for-all-covid-19):

> Democrats seem likely to push for various tweaks to the ACA that, while improving upon the status quo, still leave the health care industry's power - and mechanisms for harming patients - completely intact. We shouldn't be timid about pointing this out: for example, Democrats' plan to max out marketplace exchange premiums at 8.5 percent of income rather than 9.86 percent, as well as to eliminate the subsidy threshold so it no longer vanishes if a family's income surpasses $100,000 per year, still preserves cost-sharing so high that many patients struggle to afford care when they need it - and leaves patients stuck with often tiny provider networks, vulnerable to bill collectors and lawsuits from providers, and saddled with the administrative burden of navigating byzantine insurance companies. Short of that, the Left can rally around a new bill from Bernie Sanders and Pramila Jayapal, the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act, which would cover all necessary care for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Three grand jurors in the Breonna Taylor case filed a petition with the state House of Representatives Friday, objecting to the conduct of Attorney General Daniel Cameron and calling for his impeachment. The petition goes on to allege that Cameron "Deceived the American people and the citizens of this Commonwealth with regard to his office's handling and involvement in the Breonna Taylor investigation and the resulting legal actions. Attorney General Cameron misled the public during his hour long national press conference in stating that his office's investigation found and the grand jury agreed that [police] were justified in the return of deadly fire after having been fired upon...". The petition asks for the House to remove Cameron from office and disqualify him "From holding any office of honor, trust or profit" within Kentucky because he "Lied to the Grand Jury by excluding information and charges available to them, then lied to the public about what he had told the Grand Jury.".

> It's unfortunate that it won't happen but I fucking wish. Daniel Cameron is just biding his time til McConnell dies or retires so he can run for McConnell's seat.

## New Acting FCC Chief Jessica Rosenworcel Supports Restoring Net Neutrality

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mxja/new-acting-fcc-chief-jessica-rosenworcel-supports-restoring-net-neutrality):

> The Biden administration wasted no time promoting existing FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to be the interim boss of the nation's top telecom regulator. While the Biden FCC initially won't be able to take major steps like restoring net neutrality without a majority, Rosenworcel won't be entirely powerless. Contrary to public perception, the Trump FCC repeal of net neutrality didn't just eliminate net neutrality rules.

> >While the Biden FCC initially won’t be able to take major steps like restoring net neutrality without a majority, Rosenworcel won’t be entirely powerless. For example, she could easily withdraw the FCC’s support for the [DOJ's existing lawsuit against California](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvazkv/us-government-sues-california-for-daring-to-protect-net-neutrality) for passing state-level net neutrality rules. 
> 
> Yay to an FCC working for a broad(band) good.
> 
> And, fuck Ajit Pai. Let's erase his legacy.
