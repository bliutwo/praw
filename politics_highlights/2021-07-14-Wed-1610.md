## As a teacher, the Republican Florida law requiring students and staff to expose their political beliefs is a gross government overreach

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-school-law-sb-233-government-hypocritical-republicans-de-santis-2021-7):

> Recently, the Republican Florida Legislature passed SB 233, which mandates the State Board of Education conduct an annual survey of the "Intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity" on each campus. SB 233 will intrude in the lives of students and staff on college campuses by asking them to fill out a survey about their beliefs. SB 233 not only allows universal surveillance into classrooms but also pries into the political beliefs of students and faculty.

> >“So what I’m asking you to do is to tell your voters right that Donald Trump lost the election in 2020,” he continued. Hegseth continued to talk over him, but the smiling representative was undeterred. “Did Donald Trump lose the election in 2020?” he asked again. “Can you answer the question?”  
>   
> “I think I’m answering the questions,” Hegseth replied, stumbling over his words when he clearly meant to say that he was asking the questions as host of the show. “I don’t really feel the obligation to answer anything from you.”
> 
> I wonder if all Fox News hosts are this dumb, or if they are told to never question Donald.

## Mitt Romney calls out conservative media figures casting vaccine doubt: It's 'frankly moronic'

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/mitt-romney/1002607/mitt-romney-calls-out-conservative-media-figures-casting-vaccine-doubt-its):

> Sen. Mitt Romney had some harsh words for conservative media figures who have been casting doubt on COVID-19 vaccines over the past few months while speaking to reporters Tuesday, per The New York Times. "We don't control conservative media figures," Romney said. "After all President Trump and his supporters take credit for developing the vaccine, why the heck won't they take advantage of taking the vaccine they received plaudits for having developed?".

> 
> It was all fun and games when it was just about tax cuts, but now you better worry if you and the Mormon community might one day be on the outside looking in if the cons get their way.

## 3 Senate Democrats draft plan to end federal ban on marijuana

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ending-federal-ban-on-marijuana-senate-plan/):

> Three top Senate Democrats have a draft plan to end the federal ban on cannabis and implement a series of programs to help communities that have been harmed by the war on drugs, which have disproportionately tended to be communities of color. "It is time for Congress to end the federal marijuana prohibition and reinvest in communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs." The senators' draft proposal states the measure "Will ensure that Americans - especially Black and Brown Americans - no longer have to fear arrest or be barred from public housing or federal financial aid for higher education for using cannabis in states where it's legal." For people and communities adversely affected by the war on drugs, federal nonviolent marijuana crimes would be expunged, and those currently serving a prison sentence for a nonviolent crime would be able to petition for resentencing.

> >"You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities," Ehrlichman said. "We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."

## Top U.S. General Said Trump Preached ‘Gospel of the Führer’

Summary of [original article](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/07/i-alone-can-fix-it-mark-milley-likened-trump-to-hitler.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&utm_medium=social_acct&utm_campaign=feed-part):

> As chronicled in I Alone Can Fix It, by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, the Pentagon's top general said shortly before the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol that Trump had led the country to the brink of its own "Reichstag moment," viewing him as a potential threat to American democracy. Seven days later, Milley got a call from "An old friend" with an explicit warning that Trump and his allies were trying to "Overturn the government." Milley was confident that any attempts by Trump to hold on to power would be thwarted, because the military wouldn't go along. Still, Milley was disturbed by the sight of Trump supporters rallying to his cause in November, calling them "Brownshirts in the streets." Leonnig and Rucker wrote that Milley "Believed Trump was stoking unrest, possibly in hopes of an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and call out the military." The general likened the U.S. to Germany's fragile Weimar Republic in the early 1930s.

> You know I said the same stuff about him and people kept telling me to calm down, I’m too exaggerated, the sky isn’t falling etc. 
> 
> No this man legit idolized adolf Hitler. He and kushner tried to leave us all for dead with the virus because it was only affecting liberal states. He wanted to have the military murder us for protesting police brutality. He wanted the leaker of the bunky boy story executed. He defended and argued that Hitler did good things to our generals. Also the failed coup attempt January 6th.
> 
> No i was not exaggerating thank you very much.

> From the constitution (15th amendment):
> >The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude–
