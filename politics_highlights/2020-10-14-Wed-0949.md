## Discussion: Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing for Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett Day 3 - October 14, 2020 - Live 9:00 am ET

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb01ej/discussion_senate_judiciary_committee_hearing_for/):

> "This morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its hearings for the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The position became vacant following the death of the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September. This is President Trump's third Supreme Court nomination, following his nomination of Justice Gorsuch to replace the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, and his nomination of Justice Kavanaugh to replace Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy." Each Senator on the Judiciary Committee will have 30 minutes to question Judge Barrett. Chairman Lindsey Graham has scheduled a vote of the Judiciary Committee to follow on Friday.

> Graham again complaining that southern states don't get the same per capita contribution as NY, CA, and MA - *but those southern states refused the Medicaid expansion that came with the ACA. That's why they receive less funds!*

## Hi, I’m Matt MacWilliams! Think fascism is new in America? It’s not. Trumpism is not an anomaly in our history. AMA!

> Hello! Two questions for ya!
> 
> 1) What are your expectations should Trump get a second term in office?
> 2) Do you think that Trump’s supporters can be “de-programmed” from authoritarian tendencies or is that a fundamental part of their character?
> 3) Can fascism really be voted out? It seems like there is a disconnect between the two liberal statements that Trump is a fascist and that voting is the only legitimate form of political engagement.

## Bill Gates slams U.S. on Covid: Most governments listen to their scientists, not attack them

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/10/14/bill-gates-slams-us-on-covid-most-governments-listen-to-scientists.html):

> KEY POINTS."Our response in most respects has not been very good," billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC about the U.S. response to the coronavirus. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates criticized the U.S. response to the coronavirus, telling CNBC the nation ranks "Quite low compared to other countries" in executing testing and delivering a clear message on safe social practices such as wearing masks. "Mask compliance in the United States is quite poor. And yet the cost of the mask and the productivity lost from the mask, it's quite an intervention."

> There's a war against knowledge and education in this country. No longer, to the right, does your degree or education matter. In fact that's a hindrance to your ability. According to them education corrupts your mind and makes you less capable of handling whatever their version of the "truth" is. They will use their version of the "truth" to show that scientists, doctors, and other intelligent people are wrong and following the left is bad because the left is suddenly all evil.
> 
> If this doesn't reek of Nazi Germany's Anti-intellectualism then you aren't watching close enough.

## 'We Don't Need a Climate Denier on the Supreme Court': Outrage as Barrett Says She Has No 'Firm Views' on Climate Crisis | "If you're neutral on climate change, you're complicit in the collapse of the planetary ecosystem upon which the survival of every living thing depends."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/10/14/we-dont-need-climate-denier-supreme-court-outrage-barrett-says-she-has-no-firm-views):

> Environmentalists were appalled-if not necessarily surprised-by Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett's statement Tuesday that she does not "Have firm views" on climate change, an ostensibly neutral comment that critics said is tantamount to denial of the science. Barrett: "I'm certainly not a scientist. I have read things about climate change. I would not say I have firm views on it." We don't need a climate denier on the Supreme Court.

`/u/AngryRepublican` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb08d9/we_dont_need_a_climate_denier_on_the_supreme/):

> We should stop asking politicians if they "believe" in climate change, and instead ask if they "understand" climate change. There's no debate anymore.

## 'Hilariously Embarrassing': Women Mock Trump's Desperate Plea For Them To 'Like' Him

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/BooooHissss` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jazaez/hilariously_embarrassing_women_mock_trumps/):

> Okay, so I thought it would be at least a little coded. Maybe just out of touch enough for a laugh. No... It is actually truly embarrassing and deserves mocking.
> 
> >“I ask you to do me a favor. Suburban women: will you please like me? Please,” he begged. “Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?”
> 
> Not only is it startling desperate, the only thing coded about it is the abuser tone behind it.
> 
> "I'm just asking you to like me a little. A real small favor, just be open to liking me. I saved your damn life, you owe me, how you can not like someone who kept a house over your head. You'd be on the streets if not for me."
> 
> Edit: Slow down there people. I understand he also means keeping out the undesirables as well. I wouldn't call that coded as he openly talks about it regularly. But I also believe he would credit himself with the eviction block. It's all of these things, and it's all disgusting. But I was just using illustrative language based on personal experience.

## A tearful lesson of 2016: Polls don't matter if people don't vote

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/520792-a-tearful-lesson-of-2016-polls-dont-matter-if-people-dont-vote):

> Usually, people at VIP suites cast their eyes over each other's shoulders in search of an even more important VIP. Actual eye contact during a conversation is fleeting. Two hours later, the VIPs left our cushy suite, resembling the characters in "Night of the Living Dead.". Based on 2016, I'm reading the more sobering analyses of this election, including this week's Economist: "The race for the White House is a little closer than it looks." The magazine argues that "Differential partisan non-response" shaves points from the Biden lead: According to the Economist, "Whereas the New York Times and FiveThirtyEight.com give Mr. Biden a lead of nearly 11 percentage points nationwide, our model puts him nine points ahead. Still, even after giving the president a relative boost in the averages, our election model assigns Mr. Trump only a one-in-ten-chance of winning the election."

`/u/DrunkShimoda` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jazt9i/a_tearful_lesson_of_2016_polls_dont_matter_if/):

> In 2016, the polls predicted Clinton would beat Trump by two or three percent, and then she did.

## The Trump administration forced states to bid eBay-style for masks and ventilators, according to an explosive new documentary

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/documentary-trump-made-states-bid-ebay-style-ppe-masks-2020-10):

> The Trump administration didn't take Bowen up on his offer, even though President Donald Trump learned on January 23 that the coronavirus had the potential to spread globally. Instead, in February, the Trump administration encouraged other American mask manufacturers like 3M to sell their entire inventories of N95 masks to China, as part of its CS China COVID Procurement Service. The federal government also outbid states on several occasions, driving Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker to express frustration during a teleconference with Trump on March 19.

`/u/Whoosh747` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jb0doa/the_trump_administration_forced_states_to_bid/):

> This was in the news during March and April.  
> 
> Also, confiscated PPE that was bought and paid for, then sold in this scam.
