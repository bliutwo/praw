> Just harvested my first grow of cannabis. Can’t wait for the cure to be over so I can taste the spoils of my work and not have to go to a dispensary for a little while. Happy Friday everyone.

> The voting-machine company Dominion Voting Systems subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in its $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News. Dominion filed the lawsuit against Fox News on March 26, alleging that the network had given prominence to the election-fraud conspiracy theory to revive its ratings. In a statement in March, Fox News said: "Fox News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism." It said it would defend itself against the lawsuits in court.

> I believe we need a constitutional amendment on gerrymandering.  If the difference between the vote breakdown by party and the seats won by party is more than 10%, the districts must be redrawn to achieve a more proportional result.
> 
> This is the case across the country.  in WI, Dems win 52% of the vote and 37% of the seats.  
> 
> Frankly, I think we should move to a proportional system.  Seats should be awarded on a percentage basis.  Get rid of voting districts all together.

## Poll: More Americans Are Concerned About Voting Access Than Fraud Prevention

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012302107/poll-more-americans-are-concerned-about-voting-access-than-fraud-prevention):

> Voting Rights Poll: People More Concerned With Access Vs. Fraud Fifty-six percent are more worried that those who want to vote can, but the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll also found that most agree that voters should have to present photo ID at the polls. July 2, 2021.5:00 AM ET. A majority of Americans believe ensuring access to voting is more important than rooting out fraud, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey finds. Among Democrats, almost 9 in 10 said access was more important, but almost three-quarters of Republicans said it was making sure no one votes who isn't eligible.

`/u/wraithtek` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oc7o6f/poll_more_americans_are_concerned_about_voting/):

> Have yet to see them prove voter fraud is a widespread or significant problem.
> 
> Yet they trot it out as an excuse every time.

## US plans to make airlines refund fees if bags are delayed

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/airlines-health-coronavirus-pandemic-government-and-politics-business-9c177275146d479053f2d48adc82c27b):

> The Transportation Department will propose that airlines be required to refund fees on checked baggage if the bags aren't delivered to passengers quickly enough. Now, most U.S. airlines other than Southwest charge even for a single bag, although fees are usually waived for customers who buy high-fare tickets or carry the airline's credit card. American Airlines generated $2 billion from checked-bag fees over the past two years, followed by Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, each around $1.5 billion.

`/u/Bovey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oc8p8l/us_plans_to_make_airlines_refund_fees_if_bags_are/):

> > The proposal will require refunds if airlines fail to deliver a bag within 12 hours of the passenger’s U.S. flight touching down or within 25 hours after an international flight.
> 
> Not good enough.  I'm paying for my bag to be *on the same flight as me*.  If it doesn't show up for 12-25 hours, that's already a *major* inconvenience.

## Opinion: Don’t be fooled: This is not a moderate Supreme Court

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/01/make-no-mistake-this-is-conservative-supreme-court-it-just-sometimes-acts-slowly/):

> This Supreme Court term was significant mostly because of what the court did not do: The newly constituted 6-3 conservative supermajority did not use every case to openly and dramatically move the law rightward. In lower-profile cases, the court behaved in more obviously ideological ways - with conservatives banding together to aggressively move the law sharply to the right. In a challenge to a California public disclosure law, the court determined that states cannot require charities to report the identity of their donors to state authorities - a decision that will likely have sweeping repercussions for state and federal laws that require disclosure of campaign donations.

`/u/Homofabulous` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oc7z3i/opinion_dont_be_fooled_this_is_not_a_moderate/):

> I mean who is this for exactly? Who thinks that a conservative majority SCOTUS is moderate?
