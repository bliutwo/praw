> It wasn't just Clark. There were more people in it. As far as I see it:
> 
> * Nov 4th: Refuses to admit defeat, started with the 'frankly, we did win'
> * Dec 12th: The SCOTUS shoots down the lawsuits that reached it concerning the elections.
> * Dec 14th: Biden has enough electoral college votes from certified state results, he has finally and definitely won at this point.
> * Dec 19th: Trump tweets 'be there, it will be wild'; which seems to be one of the first mentions of the upcoming protest on the 6th by him
> * Dec 27th: Trump calls and fails to change the opinions of Rosenberg and others to turn the DOJ into his agency. Trump realizes everything so far failed, the 6th will be last chance.
> * Jan 2nd, Trump calles Raffensberger in a last attempt to have Georgia overrule its own election results.
> * Jan 3rd, Trump has last meeting with both Rosenberg and Clarke to decide what to do with Rosenberg (to replace him with Clarke, but all senior staff at the DOJ would quit)
> 
> So what we have is that after the lawsuit got shot down by SCOTUS,  in December/early January we see a multiprong attack on our democracy:
> 
> 1. State and election officials are pressured with personals call by the President to lie on his behalf
> 2. the DOJ is pressure to make bold untruthful declarations about the election (they refused)
> 3. the DOJ, FBI and CIA leadership are loyalty tested and threatened with being replaced (they and the military made clear they would quit en-masse if that happened)
> 4. the GOP loyalists in Congress put pressure on their peers to object to the vote counting on the 6th
> 5. the rhetoric leading up to the Jan 6th protest becomes more and more with fighting words, there are communications about this between organizers and the White House
> 6. the protest is more and more planned as an assault on the capitol, with tours and shared maps etc.
> 
> On nearly all of these points, the Jan 6th committee need to question Meadows and others.
> 
> My guess is that somewhere in early January, Trump with a small group of trustees make the final decision that they will send the horde towards the capitol on the 6th, as it is their last ditch chance to stay in power. It wasn't just a coup attempt. **The Jan 6th protest was a last hail mary of a weekslong campaign by the White House to overthrow the election results by illegal means after they exhausted all legal means.** It was the grand final of weeks of illegal behavior by Trump and a group of loyalist around him.
> 
> And as the article states, it is clear why Trump or his cronies where pushing for pardons for people like Meadows.

## What if the US taxed fossil fuels and gave a check to every American? Turns out, most of the public is into that idea

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/changing-america/opinion/566589-what-if-the-us-taxed-its-fossil-fuels-and-gave-a-check-to-every?amp):

> The revenue collected from the carbon fee is first used to pay for the administration of the program and the rest is distributed to every American equally as a check. Congress is currently considering the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which would add a tax on fossil fuels in order to reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030. The taxes collected would then be divided and every American will receive a check each month as a carbon cash payback.

`/u/2PLooM` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oz6654/what_if_the_us_taxed_fossil_fuels_and_gave_a/):

> How about, for starters, we stop giving the the oil industry $20 billion a year in subsidies, which they then 
> 
> 1) donate directly to political campaigns (about $100 million per election cycle; I'm sure with *no* expectation of special treatment /s)
> 
> 2) spend on lobbying politicians who they haven't already bought (again, $100's of millions of dollars every election cycle)
> 
> 3) use to spread disinformation about the reality of anthropogenic climate change (Koch brothers alone spent an estimated $145 million to spread confusion, doubt and lies).
> 
> This really is insane.  The Koch brothers, who were estimated to have more than $58 BILLION **each,** spent over $100 million just so they could make a few more bucks.  Environment be damned, human health be damned.

## MyPillow Guy Loses It as CNN Reporter Tells Him: You Have ‘Proof of Nothing’

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mike-lindell-loses-it-after-hes-told-he-has-proof-of-nothing):

> For a man who claims to have uncovered watertight evidence that the 2020 election was rigged, Mike Lindell sure gets defensive when his theories comes under any kind of questioning. Lindell presented some meaningless screenshots that he wrongly claimed showed that Chinese hackers switched Trump votes to Biden, but his "Evidence" was ridiculed when CNN asked experts to take a look. "He said it doesn't show any specific actions of any kind, election-related or not, and he said it's proof of nothing." Lindell snapped back: "Oh, so he said it's nothing, huh? Well he's wrong, you didn't hire a cyber expert." Later in the interview, Lindell lost his temper, shouting at Griffin: "You're lying!... I'm not wrong! I've checked it out! I've spent millions! You need to trust me!".

`/u/RallyPigeon` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oz9fo1/mypillow_guy_loses_it_as_cnn_reporter_tells_him/):

> We all know Mike Lindell is a liar. CNN really doesn't need to give him and his latest crazy theories airtime. Even under the guise of mocking him, which isn't a serious reason for a news channel to bring someone on anyway, they are still allowing him to circulate his garbage to a wider audience.

## DOJ notes revealed: Trump's coup was longer in the making than we thought | Jeffrey Clark was no Justice Department rogue. He was doing a dry run for a coup long in the making

`/u/EmmaLouLove` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oz9bir/doj_notes_revealed_trumps_coup_was_longer_in_the/):

> Yes, revelations from the hard press campaign by Trump and a DOJ Trump loyalist to overthrow the US election is really insane.  We must not look away from how close they came to a coup d’état.  It is still a three alarm fire.  45 must be held accountable and we must not let this criminal behavior go unanswered.  If we do, the next authoritarian President will be even more emboldened.  Democrats, there is little precious time to protect our democracy and the American vote.
