> Hey yall; thanks for doing this! My question is as follows:
> 
> There's considerable worry that the Trump campaign may manage to install new electors in key states to curtail the results of the election, and allow for a second term. It seems that Pennsylvania, so far, is outright declining to acknowledge that as a possibility, and maintaining the electors will not be changed.
> 
> What level of concern should we operate with surrounding the possibility that the Trump campaign can somehow forego the democratic process and overturn the election results, either in the courts or through their own appointments of faithless electors?

## Arizona Election Witness Confesses to Being Trump Campaign Lawyer's Business Partner in Court

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-election-witness-confesses-being-trump-campaign-lawyers-business-partner-court-1547233):

> A witness in a case brought forward by Donald Trump's campaign over election results in Arizona has admitted to being the business partner of the lawyer arguing the president's case. The development came as the court weighed allegations made by Trump's campaign, and backed by the Arizona Republican Party and Republican National Committee, that poll workers in Maricopa County routinely disregarded procedures designed to give voters a chance to correct ballot mistakes during the November 3 election. A recount isn't permitted in Arizona under the state's election laws unless the margin between competing candidates is 200 votes or less, or one-tenth of one percent of all votes cast, whichever is the smaller number.

## The crisis isn’t Trump. It’s the Republican Party.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/21562116/anne-applebaum-twilight-of-democracy-gop-trump-election-fraud-2020-biden-the-ezra-klein-show):

> We discuss why most politicians under increasingly autocratic regimes choose to collaborate with the regime, how Graham went from outspoken Trump critic to one of Trump's most vocal supporters in the US Senate, why the Republican Party ultimately took the path of Sarah Palin, what we can expect to happen if and when a much more capable demagogue emerges, and much more. Ezra Klein How do you think we would cover what Trump and the Republican Party are doing and saying right now if it were happening in another country? Ezra Klein My understanding of Graham - and I spent a bit of time with him over the years - is that in the middle of the Trump era, as he began to make this transition, his explanation was if he flattered Trump enough, he could direct Trump in important ways on things that are important to him, particularly foreign policy.

`/u/UWCG` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jtgr2j/the_crisis_isnt_trump_its_the_republican_party/):

> Of course it is. The Republican Party emboldened him. They've enabled him every step of the way. And they've been on a steady slide toward extremism for a long time, which picked up drastically during the Obama years, and has only become worse since 2016.
> 
> They all share responsibility for the national nightmare Donald has been.
