## Bill Barr on Trump's election fraud claims: "It was all bullsh*t"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/bill-barr-trump-election-8f6e5b4a-906f-4fb2-a20e-60d8f1e54b7b.html):

> Former Attorney General Bill Barr said the Justice Department always knew Trump's claims of election fraud were "Bullsh*t," according to an excerpt from journalist Jonathan Karl's upcoming book published in the The Atlantic. Why it matters: Barr's new comments come as Trump continues to propagate the lie that the 2020 election was "Rigged." Republicans in swing states now are conducting "Audits" of election ballots based on false conspiracies about the election. "You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump," Trump said, referring to himself in the 3rd person, according to Barr.

`/u/westplains1865` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o8woqv/bill_barr_on_trumps_election_fraud_claims_it_was/):

> >Barr said that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had been urging him to speak out against Trump's false claims since November but would not do so himself. McConnell did not want to upset Trump as he needed Trump to campaign in Georgia.
> “Look, we need the president in Georgia,” McConnell said, according to Barr. “And so we cannot be frontally attacking him right now. But you’re in a better position to inject some reality into this situation. You are really the only one who can do it.”
> 
> McConnell is such a gutless coward.   He was more concerned about affecting the Georgia elections than dealing with the fact Trump was whipping his gullible supporters into a rage that directly led to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.

At one point in her speech, Greene called Ocasio-Cortez "The little communist from New York City.". Marjorie Taylor Greene calls AOC a little communist and says locking her up is a good idea.

> Marjorie Taylor Greene is a former high school mean girl who got stuck that way. She's also a dolt who thinks anything she says makes sense because she's saying it.

## Majority of Gen Z Americans hold negative views of capitalism: Poll

`/u/The_Lone_Apple` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o8z4pj/majority_of_gen_z_americans_hold_negative_views/):

> Why should their or any other working class person's view of capitalism be positive? Capitalism as described by Adam Smith is supposed to have oversight and safeguards to not allow predatory businesses from using their power to crush the free market. If you own a pizzeria and two other people open up pizzerias, then eventually the free market will choose which one is best - if they survive. If not, tough luck and thanks for playing. Now in the real world, a business owner would look at the area and decide that maybe it can't sustain more than one or two of a certain business at best - like a coffee shop. 
> 
> What's gone wrong in the US is we've not enforced antitrust laws because the wealthy have bought off the politicians to weaken laws so that they can personally get rich and basically screw everyone else. That is not a recipe for a robust economy. Same goes with the labor movement. Weakened labor or pro-company laws on top of propaganda by companies to make workers think that unions "take" your money have ruined the power that labor actually has. That said, the only answer to a middle-manager saying, "Be happy you have a job," should be a swift kick in the pants.

## US billionaires don’t pay tax, and our politicians don’t seem bothered

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/24/us-billionaires-tax-returns-propublica-plutocracy):

> American billionaires don't pay taxes, and American politicians are all but ready to send Seal Team Six to assassinate the nameless bureaucrat who let ProPublica in on this fact. The billionaire tax avoidance story warranted nary a mention on the Twitter feeds of the four founders of "The Squad" aside from a retweet from AOC. And so the only elected officials who seem to have read the story ProPublica president Richard Tofel had framed as "The most important story we have ever published" were the ones who calling for the feds to ransack the ProPublica offices. The scarce press coverage of the fact that billionaires have not only paid virtually no taxes, but that they have also added to their net worths in recent years, makes the four-year media obsession with former president Donald Trump's tax returns feel like a partisan crusade that was never about a genuine commitment to ending billionaire tax avoidance, but just scoring points against Trump alone.

`/u/R0shPit` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o8z07i/us_billionaires_dont_pay_tax_and_our_politicians/):

> "*So, whereas we had been homeschooling our youngsters and ready on maintain with the unemployment division, Democrats of each declension barely say a phrase concerning the reality billionaires added $1.2tn to their fortunes over the previous yr alone*"
> 
> 
> "**Every billionaire is an inherently public determine, whose fortunes are inextricable from the material of our day by day lives**"
> 
> We be bailing out banks, printing mass money for corporations and we wonder why:
> 
> 10% control 70% of wealth.
> 
> Socialism for the tyranny of the minority. Pure capitalism for the majority.
> 
> 
> They want more police to keep the streets... how about more IRS agents to keep wall **street** in check?
