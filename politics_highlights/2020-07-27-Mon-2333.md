## The world is realizing the U.S. is no longer committed to basic standards of decency

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/canada-gives-americas-treatment-of-refugees-a-failing-grade/2020/07/27/3eabeb8e-cdfa-11ea-b0e3-d55bda07d66a_story.html):

> Justice Ann Marie McDonald ruled that Canada's practice of turning back third-country refugees who try to cross at official points of entry along the U.S.-Canada frontier - on the theory that they have already reached a safe harbor in the United States - no longer makes sense given the atrocious treatment to which they are subjected south of the border. Canada, she wrote, can no longer turn a blind eye to the reality that the United States denies decent and dignified treatment to asylum seekers. After arriving in Canada and undergoing security and medical screening, they have been allowed to work and receive basic benefits such as medical care as they await adjudication of their asylum claims.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jason-rapert-coronavirus-hoax-face-mask-arkansas-asa-hutchinson-a9640156.html):

> An Arkansas senator who shared an article that described the coronavirus pandemic as a "Hoax" has contracted Covid-19. Republican senator Jason Rapert, who unsuccessfully introduced a bill to ban gay marriage in the US in 2017, was hospitalised with coronavirus and pneumonia on 24 July. Although the senator has been pictured wearing a mask previously, he has also been critical of Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson's executive order that made wearing a face covering mandatory in the state when people are outside and when social distancing is not possible.

## Trump Needed to Be Told Republicans Were Getting Sick to Take Action on Coronavirus, Report Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-needed-to-be-told-republicans-were-getting-sick-to-take-action-on-coronavirus-report-says?via=newsletter&source=BI-CS-All):

> Donald Trump's senior advisers have begun presenting coronavirus data to the president in terms of which electorally important states could be most affected by the virus next and where GOP-leaning areas were being significantly affected in order to sway him into taking stronger action on the virus, The Washington Post reports. In recent weeks, top White House advisers have been presenting Trump "With maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among 'our people' in Republican states," according to a senior administration official quoted by the Post. This new messaging seems to have worked, according to advisers, though the president is still placing the blame for the highly contagious disease's spread and the delayed action elsewhere.

## Omar, Sanders, Merkley, Markey, Barragán Introduce Bill to End Corporate Handouts to the Fossil Fuel Industry

Summary of [original article](https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/omar-sanders-merkley-markey-barrag-n-introduce-bill-end-corporate-handouts):

> "Build A Movement 2020 is a cross-partisan alliance of Americans who call for the passage of the End Polluter Welfare Act as soon as possible. We must would abolish fossil fuel subsidies by ending tax breaks and special financing so that fossil fuel corporations pay their fair share and stop ripping off the American public," said Dr. Paul Zeitz, Executive Director, Build A Movement 2020. "Progressive Democrats of America wholeheartedly supports the End Polluter Welfare Act. We applaud Representative Omar, Representative Barragan, Senator Sanders and Senator Markey for standing up against Fossil Fuel corporations, demanding an end to tens-of-billions of dollars in subsidies to oil, gas, and coal companies, and protecting the interests of the American people and the planet," said Alan Minsky, Progressive Democrats of America. "For too long, fossil fuel companies have subjected our communities to unacceptable pollution, and our tax dollars have paid them to do it. We applaud Senator Sanders and Representative Omar's proposed legislation, which works to put an end to taxpayer-funded handouts for corporate polluters," said Kelly Martin, Director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign.

`/u/-Zenny-` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hz3n3q/omar_sanders_merkley_markey_barragán_introduce/):

> > “It’s past time we end the billions of taxpayer subsidies to fossil-fuel companies,” said Rep. Omar. “Our focus right now needs to be on getting the American people through this difficult, unprecedented time, not providing giveaways to polluters. Taxpayers provide $15 billion in direct federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry every year. That ends with this bill. I’m proud to be leading the fight for a greener future with my colleagues.”
> 
> 
> > “At a time when we are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic decline, it is absurd to provide billions of taxpayer subsidies that pad fossil-fuel companies’ already-enormous profits,” said Senator Sanders. “Big Oil made more than $2 trillion in profits over the last two decades. We need more safe, healthy, good paying jobs—not more corporate polluter giveaways.”
> 
> Thank you Representative Omar and Senator Sanders for having the courage to do what many of your colleagues are too afraid to do. We need to continue to take on the fossil fuel industry no matter how many wealthy donors tell the party not to.

## President Trump suggested that Twitter's trending topics are 'illegal' because they make him look bad

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-twitter-trending-topics-are-illegal-and-unfair-2020-7):

> President Donald Trump reignited his feud with Twitter on Monday, suggesting that the website's trending topics section is "Illegal" because the topics and content that appear there make him look bad. "So disgusting to watch Twitter's so-called 'Trending', where sooo many trends are about me, and never a good one. They look for anything they can find, make it as bad as possible, and blow it up, trying to make it trend. Really ridiculous, illegal, and, of course, very unfair!" Trump tweeted. Trump didn't mention a specific trend or cite any evidence to support his claim that Twitter was intentionally biasing its trends against him, nor did he say which laws he believed the company is violating. Twitter's website says that "Trends are determined by an algorithm and, by default, are tailored for you based on who you follow, your interests, and your location." Users can also view topics that are trending by location instead of those personalized for them, according to the site.

> You know what else makes you look bad? 150,000 dead Americans in the last 4 months, while you throw ridiculous tantrums on Twitter.
