## Trump blatantly boosts his own hotel in the relief bill, and Republicans play dumb

> SENATE REPUBLICANS feigned bewilderment the other day at why the White House insisted on including $1.75 billion to rebuild the FBI's downtown Washington headquarters in the latest pandemic relief bill. As everyone in Congress knows, the Trump Organization's financial interests are heavily entangled in the prospects for the current FBI site. Still, GOP senators played dumb when asked why funding for a new FBI headquarters would be a priority for the White House in a bill meant for economic relief from the pandemic's ravages.

## Mail Delays Fuel Concern Trump Is Undercutting Postal System Ahead of Voting

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage):

> Arthur B. Sackler, who runs the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a group representing the biggest bulk mailers, said the changes were concerning even though his organization did not take a position on voting by mail. Mr. Trump - who himself has repeatedly voted by mail in recent elections - has set in motion changes at the Postal Service that could make the problem worse. A 2018 report by the Treasury Department recommended an overhaul of the Postal Service, which the report said accumulated losses of $69 billion from 2007 to 2018.But the administration's critics say the changes being put in place by Mr. DeJoy are part of a political agenda to move toward privatization of the Postal Service.

> 'Concern'. Seriously? He's outright stated a dozen, dozen points surrounding this issue which make it pretty fucking unequivocal that this is exactly his goal. He and the GOP are doing everything in their power to undermine democratic institutions and processes in the U.S. and yet you *still* have news media being tentative (cowardly) with their reporting.
