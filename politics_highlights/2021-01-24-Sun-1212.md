## Romney on Trump impeachment: 'If we're going to have unity,' there must be 'accountability'

Summary of [original article](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/romney-trump-impeachment-trial-fox-news-sunday):

> Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, expressed support for the upcoming impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, telling "Fox News Sunday" that a trial is needed to achieve "Truth and justice." Romney, who voted to convict Trump at his first impeachment, cited Trump's effort to convince Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's election result, as well as his call for a march on the U.S. Capitol at a Jan. 6 rally immediately preceding the violent riot. TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL DELAYED UNTIL WEEK OF FEB. 8, SCHUMER SAYS. "Well, we're certainly going to have a trial. I wish that weren't necessary, but the president's conduct with regards to the call to Secretary of State Raffensperger in Georgia as well as the incitation towards the insurrection that led to the attack on the Capitol call for a trial," Romney said.

> Unity doesn't mean we all agree on policies.  Unity means we all agree to come to the negotiating table to hash out our differences and hopefully arrive at a compromising bill which most can support.

## Congress must face the enemy within | Members of Congress who endangered their colleagues, or who violated their oaths of office and fed the insurrection with their lies, must be held accountable for the Jan. 6 attack.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/24/opinion/congress-must-face-enemy-within/):

> "There are many members of the United States Congress right now who could not tell you where that office is," he told MSNBC. "How did they know where that office was? Something's wrong here." Attention has centered on Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who was seen days before the invasion by two Democratic legislators with a "Large" group in the tunnel that connects the Cannon House Office Building to the Capitol - though she insists that she was only leading family members on tours. Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas continued to lead their shameful effort even after the rioting that left five people, including a Capitol police officer, dead. They both openly raised campaign contributions off their despicable conduct, giving new meaning to the term blood money.

`/u/BubbleBronx` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l40c3c/congress_must_face_the_enemy_within_members_of/):

> Trump and his base, with the full support of the Republican Party, planned and executed a coup to overthrow the Government and kill representatives.
> 
> It’s time to stop trying to ‘reach across the aisle’ and to see them as what they are - a fascist movement. They are dangerous and cannot be compromised with. Their goals are nefarious and they will not stop unless there is accountability for their crimes and sedition, if democracy is to survive.
