## We’re Arizona Republic reporters Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ronald J. Hansen. We produced a podcast about SB 1070, which codified racial profiling in Arizona’s policing 10 years ago and helped make Arizona a presidential battleground today. Ask us anything.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hwl594/were_arizona_republic_reporters_yvonne_wingett/):

> We recently launched "Rediscovering: SB 1070," a podcast that examines how Senate Bill 1070 - AKA the "Show me your papers" law - came to be. Arizona passed SB 1070 in 2010 in response to the federal logjam on immigration. Ten years later, we're taking a look at the forces that led to SB 1070 and its immediate fallout.

> How much did Martha McSally's [liberal hack](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/01/16/martha-mcsally-calls-manu-raju-liberal-hack-parnas-evidence-bash-bts-vpx.cnn) publicity stunt during Trump's impeachment affect her chances for November? Was it a smart move or not a smart move, given the makeup of Arizona's general election electorate?

## Stephen Miller rejects claim grandmother died of COVID — Stephen Miller, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, is insisting his grandmother did not die of the coronavirus, despite a death certificate that states otherwise.

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/stephen-miller-rejects-claim-grandmother-died-of-covid-636188):

> Stephen Miller, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, is insisting his grandmother did not die of the coronavirus, despite a death certificate that states otherwise. Miller's maternal uncle, David Glosser, who has criticized Miller in the past for crafting Trump's restrictive immigration policies, took to Facebook to commemorate the death of his mother, Ruth Glosser, who died at 97 in Southern California, Mother Jones reported Thursday. "His grandmother did not pass away from COVID. She was diagnosed with COVID in March and passed away in July, so that timeline does not add up at all. His grandmother died peacefully in her sleep from old age. I would hope that you would choose not to go down this road."Mother Jones presented the White House with her death certificate, which listed "Respiratory arrest" and COVID-19 as "a condition leading" to the cause of death.

> Now we can literally say this weasel would gaslight his own dead grandmother to suck Trump's dick, and we'll be right.

## Fauci says he has been assigned personal security after receiving 'serious threats' to his family

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-given-personal-security-after-threats-family-2020-7):

> Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert on the White House coronavirus task force, says he and his family have been assigned personal security after receiving "Serious threats." Speaking on CNN's "The Axe Files" podcast, Fauci said the threats were of a different magnitude from those he received while working on the federal government's response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s. As measures designed to slow the virus - such as mask-wearing and lockdowns - have become points of partisan conflict, Fauci has also come under attack.

> All thanks to Trump.  What other president in US history attacks his own medical experts that work for him?  We have [4.1 million cases of coronavirus and 147K dead Americans from it](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) because this president doesn't listen to his own scientists and instead, he attacks them. SMH.

## Federal Agents Shoot Portland Reporter Hours After Judge Issues Restraining Order to Protect Journalists During Protests

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/federal-agents-shoot-portland-reporter-hours-after-judge-issues-restraining-order-to-protect-journalists-during-protests/):

> A federal judge in Oregon on Thursday afternoon issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting federal officers deployed in Portland from using physical force against news reporters and legal observers documenting the ongoing protests and riots in that city. Just hours after the ruling, video emerged showing federal troops firing teargas projectiles at - and ultimately hitting - a local journalist with Oregon Public Broadcasting who was recording the ongoing conflict. Simon further explained that federal officers will not be liable for violating the order if journalists are "Incidentally exposed" to crowd-control devices after the federal agents have issued "An otherwise lawful dispersal order."

## Trump Is Flailing, and the Country Is Paying the Price

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/china-consulate-executive-orders-trump/):

> Speaking of "Lawless": Trump reportedly urged the US ambassador to the United Kingdom to lobby the Brits to move the British Open golf tournament to one of Trump's Scottish golf courses. Now, with the election just around the corner, Yoo is busy ingratiating himself with the current administration: He argues that the Supreme Court's recent DACA ruling-in which justices said the administration would have needed to go through the Administrative Procedure Act to revoke the program-actually means that Trump can sign a bunch of big-picture, probably illegal executive orders, because the Supreme Court will mandate a multiyear process to overturn them. It's absurd because the Supreme Court has already ruled that the Census cannot include a question about immigration status, making it impossible for Census-takers to know whether respondents are undocumented-but the memo is a harbinger of what's coming down the road. Trump is going to push every legal boundary he can to fire up his base between now and November.

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hwzl3v/trump_is_flailing_and_the_country_is_paying_the/):

> Over 146,000 deaths and counting because Trump has failed at every turn during this pandemic. 
> 
> Millions of people still out of work and unable to make ends meet yet corporations got their bail outs.
