## Trump seems depressed and is doing little work apart from pursuing his election fraud claims, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/depressed-trump-avoiding-work-not-related-to-election-fraud-nyt-2020-12):

> President Donald Trump seems occasionally "Depressed" and is avoiding official duties as he fixates on his claims that the election was stolen from him, for which he has not produced any compelling evidence, reported The New York Times Saturday. According to the report, the president is "Ignoring the health and economic crises afflicting the nation" and is clearing his public schedule of meetings not related to his bid to overturn the election result. At his first rally in Georgia since his election loss a month ago, Trump on Saturday focussed on his election fraud claims, which have been rejected by GOP election officials in the state.
