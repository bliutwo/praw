> I've worked on political campaigns at the local, state, and federal level, and coauthored several papers on statistics and public policy-most recently on election prediction and election security. I'm also the co-chair of the American Political Science Association's Election Assistance Taskforce, a non-partisan cohort of political scientists that's focused on encouraging participation and providing a broader understanding for issues related to voting.

> It looks like Donald Trump’s next play will be to try and manipulate the electoral college by preventing or delaying the certification of results and working to have his electors appointed in states that he lost. *(he’s trying to create the legal situation and political climate needed to legitimize this situation)* 
> 
> It is said that GOP state legislatures may be able to use their power to aid Trump in this effort, and the GOP has already proven that traditions, precedents, and norms are not sacred to them in the slightest. 
> 
> How likely is this scenario to pan out for Donald Trump and what are the hurdles he faces in this strategy?

## Trump Supporter Admits Voter Fraud, Says She Voted Twice For President in Viral Video

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-supporter-voter-fraud-president-viral-video-1546876):

> A President Donald Trump supporter admitted to voter fraud in a viral video, as she says she tried to vote for Trump twice in the 2016 election. In May 2020, they questioned a Trump supporter about voter fraud, who then admitted to committing it herself in the 2016 election, in a video that has been viewed more than 630,000 times on Twitter, 80,000 on Instagram, and 190,000 times on TikTok at the time of writing. In a reply to an Instagram comment that sarcastically said: "Yeah... It's not fake at all. Those people are not acting," The Good Liars responded: "You got us! She is NOT a real woman named Terri [Lynn] Rote who was convicted of voter fraud in Iowa for voting for Donald Trump twice in 2016. I can't believe you figured it out!".

## USPS ‘Whistleblower’ Told Agents Project Veritas Penned His Ballot-Tampering Claim

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/usps-staffer-richard-hopkins-told-agents-project-veritas-penned-his-ballot-tampering-claim?ref=home):

> A two-hour audio recording released by Project Veritas on Wednesday shows Richard Hopkins being interviewed by federal investigators over his claim, first publicized by Project Veritas, that he had overheard a postmaster instructing workers in Erie, Pennsylvania, to backdate mail-in votes to meet the Election Day deadline. The audio had been touted by the conservative group as proof that Hopkins was manipulated by investigators but still stood by his allegations, despite House Democrats saying earlier this week that the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General told them Hopkins admitted to fabricating the claims. Hopkins told investigators not only that his affidavit was written by Project Veritas but that he wasn't even entirely sure of what the group had included in it because he was in "So much shock I wasn't paying that much attention to what they were telling me." A spokesman for Project Veritas acknowledged having a hand in the affidavit but insisted that the "Affidavit was drafted with Mr. Hopkins' input and requested revisions," according to the Post.Read it at The Washington Post.

## Trump Won Florida After Running a False Ad Tying Biden to Venezuelan Socialists

Summary of [original article](http://feeds.propublica.org/link/9499/14062947/trump-won-florida-after-running-a-false-ad-tying-biden-to-venezuelan-socialists):

> In Florida, where President Donald Trump gained crucial support among Latino voters, his campaign ran a YouTube ad in Spanish making the explosive - and false - claim that Venezuela's ruling clique was backing Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Then the text on the screen reiterates that "The Chavistas" - the political party that controls Venezuela - "Want Joe Biden to win." The video concludes with a statement that it was paid by the Trump campaign and Trump saying that he approved the message. A tweet from President Trump called Biden a "PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS." Trump ads on Facebook called Biden a "Socialist" and pictured him with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom refer to themselves as democratic socialists.

## Barr isn’t just humoring Trump. He’s weaponizing law enforcement.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/12/barr-memo-trump-campaign/?outputType=amp):

> Barr states in the memo that he has already authorized election investigations. The Barr memo contains three revealing elements, each of which lowers the threshold for instituting an improper political investigation. Barr, in explaining his disagreement with then-FBI Director James B. Comey's 2016 conduct, testified during his confirmation hearing that federal law enforcement authorities should not take actions that could sway an election, since the incumbent party has its hands on the "Levers of the law enforcement apparatus." Now he has done just that, and in a systemic and deliberate way that is far worse than the rogue behavior Comey undertook.

## Donald Trump Has Suffered a Defeat of Historic Proportions

Summary of [original article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-lost-denial-pompeo/):

> So here's a reference point for the Republican Party leaders who are now joining Donald Trump in a go-down-with-the-ship refusal to concede the 2020 presidential election: Joe Biden is currently winning that election by a higher percentage of the national popular vote than Reagan did in his historic victory over President Jimmy Carter. Biden has won the presidency with a higher percentage of the vote than Trump in 2016, George W. Bush in 2004 or 2000, Bill Clinton in 1996 or 1992, Reagan in 1980, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Richard Nixon in 1968, John Kennedy in 1960, or Harry Truman in 1948. Since Biden's electors are likely to stick with him when the college's votes are announced on December 14, the Democrat will win with a slightly higher number of electoral votes than were counted for Trump in 2016-when a pair of Republican "Faithless" electors in Texas backed former Texas US Representative Ron Paul and former Ohio governor John Kasich.
