> You know; I'm starting to think that putting forward absolutely zero evidence and constantly saying that "it's on the way" isn't the correct way to prove massive election fraud.

Summary of [original article](https://nypost.com/2020/11/28/trump-paid-3m-in-wisconsin-recount-sees-biden-gain-132-votes/):

> President Trump spent $3 million for recounts in two Wisconsin counties after the election - but so far the end result is 132 more votes for Joe Biden. Trump requested recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties - which are largely Democratic - in hopes of clawing back a victory in the state. The Dane recount is continuing; so far, it's tipped 68 votes in Trump's favor, with the recount there expected to wrap up on Sunday.

## Former security officials warn Donald Trump won't keep state secrets

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/donald-trump-security-intelligence-briefings-b1763195.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1606569650):

> American security experts are concerned that Donald Trump will be unable to keep state secrets when he leaves the White House, and should be barred from receiving future intelligence briefings, according to reports. Mr Preiss, who briefed former president George H.W. Bush as a CIA agent, was among a number of security experts who raised concerns to NBC News. According to NBC News, former presidents are given briefings before they travel overseas, or when the current president wants to consult them, but Mr Trump has not believed to have done so, with former president Barack Obama.

`/u/george_nelson` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2nq45/former_security_officials_warn_donald_trump_wont/):

> Trump will absolutely sell any secrets if given the opportunity.  But he didn't read the briefings, rarely attended presentations, doesn't remember what was said, and will fuck it up when he tries to tell it.

## Trump Biographer Hits President Where It Hurts: Can’t Even Succeed At Being A Loser

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5fc2202bc5b6e4b1ea4b8eec):

> A biographer of Donald Trump turned one of the president's favorite insults - "Loser" - against him and described Trump's refusal to accept defeat in the 2020 election as "Buffoonery." "He's so incompetent that he cannot even succeed at being a loser," he said. D'Antonio also suggested that Trump is "Quite capable" of not attending President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, saying the outgoing president might "Very well declare a 2024 run before Inauguration Day and thereby try to deprive Biden of the attention that he deserves."

`/u/Stigmetal110` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2lvxi/trump_biographer_hits_president_where_it_hurts/):

## ‘Republicans Remain Opposed to Any Policies That Would Reduce Fossil-Fuel Use’

Summary of [original article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/republicans-climate-change-biden-science-greenhouse-gas.html):

> For more than a decade, the GOP has stood alone among major right-of-center parties in industrialized democracies worldwide in its refusal to endorse climate science. What kind of innovation do Republicans want? Halfway through the Examiner story, we arrive at the bottom line: "Republicans remain opposed to any policies that would reduce fossil-fuel use." A recent Wall Street Journal editorial explains that any policy to curtail climate change poses an inherent threat to American security.

`/u/teenwitchsbrother` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k2nhid/republicans_remain_opposed_to_any_policies_that/):

> Republican voters hate their grandchildren.
