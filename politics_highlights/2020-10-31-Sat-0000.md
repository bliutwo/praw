## I’m Greg Giroux, a senior political reporter for Bloomberg Government. AMA about Tuesday's elections for Congress!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jl16ut/im_greg_giroux_a_senior_political_reporter_for/):

> I report for Bloomberg Government on the 2020 U.S. House and Senate elections from Washington, D.C. I also co-host BGOV's Downballot Counts podcast, write profiles of members of Congress, and analyze congressional voting behavior and money in politics. I've been with Bloomberg for more than 10 years, and before that I worked as a political reporter at CQ. Election Day on Tuesday is just around the corner! The presidential race is getting the lion's share of attention, but there are many other consequential elections including for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, and state legislatures. So what would you like to know? Will the Democrats sweep by winning control of the presidency and the Senate and keeping their majority in the House? Can Republicans keep their Senate majority? Which Senate and House races appear to be the most competitive? Is there a Senate or House election you want to know more about?

> It seems the Democrat majority in the House is liable to remain, if not increase somewhat.  My concern is with the Senate, though...
> 
> As an independent, I have always disliked any one party having a supermajority (House, Senate, White House).  This election is an outlier, though, and I find myself wanting one pretty fervently.  From the reading I've done, the fate of the Senate is far from-certain.  
> 
> 
> I suppose I could do more reading, but I'm curious as to your analysis about this.  How likely are McConnel's Republicans to maintain their narrow majority?  Which states' races will determine this?  
>

> Thanks in advance, Greg.

## Nancy Pelosi: All Trump SCOTUS Justices Should Recuse From Election Decisions

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-supreme-court-justices-recuse-elections_n_5f9c72ddc5b6cfec2f6d89bd):

> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that all three Supreme Court justices appointed by President Donald Trump should recuse themselves from cases tied to potential election disputes because they have already demonstrated that they want to make it harder for people to vote and have a conflict of interest because Trump nominated them. While the court tied 4-4 in that decision, which means the state can still count ballots received after Election Day, Pelosi pointed out that the justices said they wanted to revisit the matter. The president himself has suggested he's counting on the court to have his back when he makes false claims of election fraud ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

## Texas GOP senator didn't "graduate" from Oxford University law program, as claimed in prior campaign

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/10/30/texas-gop-senator-didnt-graduate-from-oxford-university-law-program-as-claimed-in-prior-campaign/):

> Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tx., who currently finds himself in an unusually competitive race against Democratic opponent MJ Hegar, previously falsely represented himself as a graduate of Oxford University in England in the run-up to his successful election to the Texas Supreme Court, press and public records show. During his campaign for attorney general of Texas eight years later, Cornyn repeatedly attacked Republican rival Barry Williamson for padding his resume "Just like Lena Guerrero did" - a reference to a Texas Democrat who two years prior lost a race for state office to Williamson after it was revealed that she had lied about having a college diploma. A 2020 freedom of information request to Oxford University reviewed by Salon returned no record of Cornyn graduating from or attending a regular or continuing studies program offered through the school.

## Noam Chomsky Believes Trump Is “the Worst Criminal in Human History”

Summary of [original article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/noam-chomsky-believes-trump-is-the-worst-criminal-in-human-history):

> What we're talking about has to do with the most urgent things you can imagine-human survival, the fate of my grandchildren, all sorts of things. For one thing, I'm absolutely bombarded with requests for talks and interviews. There's a lot of people who really are doing very serious things.

`/u/Foxedup` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jl5qyf/noam_chomsky_believes_trump_is_the_worst_criminal/):

> For those not reading the article, the quote above is basically thatt:
> 
> According to Chomsky, Hitler and Stalin killed to maintain power, but it was a select group to maintain that power, not their goal to kill everyone.
> 
> Trump as a politician is willfully removing all environmental regulations he can, while completely understanding it will lead to global climate collapse in the near future after he's gone. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Recall Trump at the first debate when responding to whether or not he believes in climate change as a threat, answered affirmatively that he believes human green house gasses are contributing to global climate change. Then recall the follow up question, why is he removing regulations on fossil fuels? Answer:  “Because it was driving energy prices through the sky,”

## New polling reinforces a key Biden advantage: People like him more

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/30/new-polling-reinforces-key-biden-advantage-people-like-him-more/):

> Among those who viewed both President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden unfavorably in Quinnipiac University's polling, for example, Biden led by 33 points last December. I'd ask their always-helpful team for the breakdown among voters who viewed both Biden and Trump unfavorably only to learn, time and again, that there weren't enough people in that category to be statistically significant. We've also included the Biden-Trump margin indicated with a horizontal dashed line and FiveThirtyEight's national polling margin between Biden and Trump indicated with a vertical dashed line.

`/u/Agolf_Lincler` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jl7p19/new_polling_reinforces_a_key_biden_advantage/):

> I mean to be fair, its not much of a contest between these two. One is that kindly, kinda cool in a "square" way old dude you've seen around. The other is a loud mouthed, spoiled rich daddy's boy that won't ever shut up and smells funny.
