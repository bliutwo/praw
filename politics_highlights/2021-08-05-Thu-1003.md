> And this is the fatal flaw in Biden's plan to "out-organize and outvote" the opposition.. if people's right to vote is taken away, and if state legislatures can just simply overrule local election boards, turning out even hundreds of thousands more votes isn't enough

> DENVER - A federal magistrate on Wednesday levied penalties against two Colorado attorneys for filing a class-action lawsuit that alleged the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump. In the end, Trump and his allies lost more than 50 of the election lawsuits. The lawyers in the Colorado case, Gary D. Fielder and Ernest J. Walker, were not connected with other Trump lawyers - including Sidney Powell, who is one of multiple Trump-backing attorneys who face possible sanctions for an unsuccessful lawsuit challenging the election results in Michigan.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-comms-manager-helped-cuomo-respond-lindsey-boylan-report-2021-8):

> A top Facebook communications manager helped New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo respond to his first sexual-harassment allegation by contacting the press about the accuser's personnel file, a Tuesday report from the New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The New York Daily News reported last August that she was leaving the governor's office to join Facebook as a communications manager. The report questioned why Lever, Chris Cuomo, and others that were not "Officially retained in any capacity by the Executive Chamber" were "Regularly provided with confidential and often privileged information about state operations and helped make decisions that impacted State business and employees."
