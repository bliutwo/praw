## Goodbye, Stephen Miller

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/stephen-miller-family-separation-goodbye-trump-administration.html):

> Who Stephen Miller is doesn't matter, in other words. Because while Stephen Miller was in the White House, thousands of children were forcibly marked with the trauma of being caged away from their parents, and hundreds may never see their parents again. Stephen Miller's foulness is an idea that has been given shape and breath by Stephen Miller the person.

> And Jared. And Ivanka. And DJ. And Eric. And Kayleigh. And Barr. And Meadows. And Pence. And......

## Mute Trump : For four years, you had to read what this guy tweeted. Now you don’t.

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/trump-twitter-tweets-mute-biden-wins.html):

> Even assuming an orderly transfer of power, Donald Trump will still be president for 74 days-days in which he is no longer accountable to the will of the electorate, nor bound to anything but his own destructive desires. If for some reason you still follow Trump on Twitter, or even if you just follow people prone to signal-boosting his messages, it's time to rid yourself of those negative influences in your life. Let Trump whine about the unfairness of the election, the rigged system, the ungrateful Republican politicians who started edging silently away the minute they smelled Trump's blood in the water.

`/u/vangoghsnephew` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jpu2ua/mute_trump_for_four_years_you_had_to_read_what/):

> Actually, I've just unblocked him after 4 years specifically to witness an absolute meltdown.

## Biden to announce COVID-19 task force Monday

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/biden-to-announce-covid-19-task-force-monday-23b353bd-863b-4e0f-bb64-c6da4a5758b2.html):

> Joe Biden plans Monday to name a 12-member task force to combat and contain the spread of the coronavirus, sources tell Axios. Why it matters: By announcing a COVID task force even before unveiling his senior White House staff or a single cabinet appointment, Biden is signaling that addressing the coronavirus will be the immediate priority for his transition, and then his potential administration. Some members of the group have been advising Biden throughout the campaign, both the public policy challenges, as well as adopting health protocols for the campaign itself to prevent the spread of the virus in Biden's inner circle.
