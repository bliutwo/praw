## Sidney Powell’s Hidden ‘Kraken’ Witness Is a Pro-Trump Podcaster Once Sued for Fraud: WaPo

> The secret source behind Sidney Powell's "Kraken" lawsuits is a pro-Trump podcaster whom North Dakota sued for fraud, The Washington Post reports. Powell, whom Trump considered naming a Special Counsel on voter fraud, had filed an affidavit alleging election fraud based on the testimony of a secret source she claimed was a former intelligence contractor. The affidavit matches a November 2019 blog post published by Terpsichore Maras-Lindeman, and the blogger told the Post she wrote the court filing itself.

## Trump's promise to "work tirelessly" on Christmas means golfing with buddies and ignoring COVID relief

Summary of [original article](https://www.mic.com/p/trumps-promise-to-work-tirelessly-on-christmas-means-golfing-with-buddies-ignoring-covid-relief-52773333):

> These are not normal circumstances, and despite the White House's declaration that "During the Holiday season, President Trump will continue to work tirelessly for the American people" the president is instead spending his time relaxing with pals - even as perhaps the most significant legislation of the year sits waiting for his signature. At around 10 a.m. on Christmas morning, President Trump hit the links, marking the second time in as many days that he's gone golfing at his Florida resort instead of handling the "Many meetings and calls" promised on his official White House schedule for the day. Joining Trump was critic-turned-enabler Sen. Lindsey Graham, who just days earlier joined the president in demanding that the tenuously negotiated COVID relief bill be increased to include $2,000 direct payment checks, rather than the agreed upon $600. Indeed, both the President seems so committed to raising the direct payment amount that he is pointedly ignoring the existing COVID relief bill that his own White House helped negotiate, and which simply needs his signature to rush paltry-but-better-than-nothing $600 checks to the public.

## Trump reportedly baffled that Mike Pence can't simply declare him president again

> So here's why Trump thinks Pence can declare him president again (per article):
> "With his options in the courts dwindling, Trump has now reportedly set his sights on January 6, when Congress meets to certify the Electoral College vote ... Trump is so ignorant of the constitutionally prescribed process for presidential elections that he is reportedly "confused" when aides try to explain why Pence can't simply hand him an Electoral College victory on January 6. Pence, for his part, has apparently joined in with the president's advisors in trying to convince Trump that actually, no, he can't just decide who gets to be the next president, even though he does technically oversee the process."

## Sanders Rips GOP for Happily Endorsing Trump's Assault on Democracy But Refusing to Back His Call for $2,000 Checks | "Pathetic," said the Vermont senator.

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/25/sanders-rips-gop-happily-endorsing-trumps-assault-democracy-refusing-back-his-call):

> More than half of the House Republican caucus readily supported President Donald Trump in his last-ditch-and ultimately failed-attempt to overturn the November election through the Supreme Court earlier this month, but the president's endorsement this week of $2,000 relief checks for desperate Americans was a bridge too far for the GOP. Sen. Bernie Sanders noted that fact with disgust Thursday, shortly after House Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to pass $2,000 direct payments by unanimous consent. "Republicans in Washington are happy to cheer on Trump's bogus conspiracy theories on non-existent election fraud, but refuse to support him when it comes to providing a $2,000 direct payment to working-class Americans facing economic desperation." -Sen. Bernie Sanders. "In May, we voted to send you $1,200 stimulus checks. Republicans rejected that too. The Republican Party does not give a damn about you."

## Trump’s border wall was a complete waste of time and money

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-border-wall-was-a-complete-waste-of-time-and-money/2020/12/24/444c165e-4564-11eb-b0e4-0f182923a025_story.html):

> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S border wall has reached an inflection point. Even as more miles of wall are completed, the number of unauthorized migrants apprehended after crossing the border has spiked in recent months to the highest level in years. For taxpayers, to whom Mr. Trump promised that Mexico would foot the bill - it hasn't paid a dime - the wall has been a raw deal.

> Guarantee that his buddies at GFC (the Grifting Fencing Company) don’t think it was a waste of time or money. They were paid quite handsomely for the mile of fence they put up, which they surely returned much of which in kind by staying at Trump properties for $125,000 a night.
