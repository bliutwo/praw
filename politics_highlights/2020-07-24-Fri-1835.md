## The $600 Unemployment Benefits Are Expiring This Weekend Because Senate Republicans Didn’t Do Anything

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/congress-lets-600-unemployment-money-expire):

> One saving grace was that shortly after she lost her job at a local university, Congress passed the CARES Act, providing $600 per week in federal unemployment insurance aid on top of state benefits. Over 30 million people are drawing unemployment and will be left with state benefits only, which tend to be less than half of the federal amount. "We're days away from a crisis if these federal unemployment benefits aren't renewed," said Casey Wilkinson, executive director of Piedmont Rising.

## Trump's press secretary aired a propaganda-like video of Portland protests that was so disturbing even Fox News cut away from it

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-cut-away-from-disturbing-portland-video-wh-briefing-2020-7):

> Fox News quickly cut away before returning to the briefing for the Q&A portion. Fox News host Harris Faulkner addressed the decision to cut away twice but did not specify if the violence or profanity was the principal reason for turning away from the briefing. "We were not expecting that video, and our management here at Fox News has decided we will cut away at this time," Faulkner said right after the network cut away.

`/u/Ahefp` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hx8zbw/pelosi_schumer_joint_statement_on_mitch_mcconnell/):

> “This weekend, millions of Americans will lose their Unemployment Insurance, will be at risk of being evicted from their homes, and could be laid off by state and local government, and there is only one reason: Republicans have been dithering for months while America’s crisis deepens.
> 
> “As our country marks the grave milestone of four million infections, we call upon Leader McConnell to get serious about the needs of working families, stop the unnecessary delays and produce a proposal so that we can sit down and reach an agreement that puts workers and families first.  More than two months ago, the House of Representatives passed the Heroes Act: supporting our heroes who risk their lives to save lives and risk losing jobs, crushing the virus with the testing, tracing and treatment to reopen safely and putting money in Americans’ pockets. 
> 
> “We had expected to be working throughout this weekend to find common ground on the next COVID response package.  It is simply unacceptable that Republicans have had this entire time to reach consensus among themselves and continue to flail.  Time is of the essence and lives are being lost.”

## A Dam Breaks As Whites Abandon the GOP — According to new polling, Joe Biden is close to erasing Trump’s advantage with Caucasian voters.

Summary of [original article](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/07/24/a-dam-breaks-as-whites-abandon-the-gop/):

> Joe Biden is now close to erasing the Republicans' traditional advantage with white voters, but he's underperforming with Black and Hispanic people compared to Hillary Clinton. The same can be said for publishing people who argue for the inherent superiority of whites. Trump's excesses have jolted enough white people to not only lose him support, but to lose support for many of the structurally racist things that have gone unexamined outside of leftist circles.

> The #1 issue has got to be the coronavirus and I can't understand why Trump would think denying reality is the way to go. He literally just had to declare war on it and then follow the professionals and people would have lapped it up.

## Twenty-One State Attorneys General File Suit to Stop 'Illegal' Effort by Trump to Skew the Census for Political Gain

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/07/24/twenty-one-state-attorneys-general-file-suit-stop-illegal-effort-trump-skew-census):

> New York state Attorney General Letitia James on Friday spearheaded a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over his attempt to "Illegally" tip the representation in the U.S. House of Representatives by excluding the counting of undocumented immigrants in the 2020 census. According to a statement from James' office, the suit-filed by a coalition of states, cities, and counties and backed by 21 attorneys general nationwide-"Seeks to stop the Trump Administration from politicizing the census and violating basic constitutional commands, and instead aims to ensure the administration counts the 'whole number of persons' residing in the country for apportionment, as the U.S. Constitution unambiguously requires." In announcing Friday's lawsuit-which names Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Census Bureau, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Census Director Steven Dillingham-James said the president's effort to upend the census by targeting immigrant communities and excluding the undocumented from being counted "Is the latest in a long list of anti-immigrant actions and statements he has made since the beginning of his first campaign."

## A Texas hospital is so overrun with coronavirus cases that officials say it will send the patients least likely to survive home to die

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-starr-county-hospital-forced-choose-who-sent-home-die-2020-7):

> A hospital in Starr County, Texas, is so overrun with coronavirus cases that officials there said it would choose which patients to use its resources on and send those most likely to die back home to their families. Vasquez added that a committee would decide which patients were most likely to die at Starr County Memorial Hospital - the only hospital in the county - and would send them home. "Unfortunately, Starr County Memorial Hospital has limited resources and our doctors are going to have to decide who receives treatment, and who is sent home to die by their loved ones," he said.
