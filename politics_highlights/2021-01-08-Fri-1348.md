## Trump, Rudy Giuliani and Don Jr. may be charged over Capitol siege, DC AG says

Summary of [original article](https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/dc-ag-trump-giuliani-don-jr-may-be-charged-over-capitol-siege/):

> WASHINGTON - President Trump, son Donald Trump Jr. and Rudy Giuliani may all be investigated and charged for their potential roles in inciting a violent mob that stormed the US Capitol, Washington, DC's top prosecutor hinted Friday. "Donald Trump Jr., Giuliani, even the president of the United States, were calling on their supporters and hate groups to go to the Capitol and in the words of Rudy Giuliani 'exercise combat justice,'" he went on. The violent episode has caused an enormous fallout in the Trump administration, with several cabinet members resigning in the wake of the Capitol violence and calls mounting for Trump to be removed via the 25th Amendment and/or a second impeachment.

## Pelosi wants ‘unhinged’ Trump to be stripped of nuclear codes

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/pelosi-trump-riot-war-nuclear-weapons-b1784580.html):

> The bold move was announced by her office on Friday in a letter to House Democrats under a section titled "Preventing an Unhinged President from Using the Nuclear Codes". "The situation of this unhinged president could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy." "Nearly 50 years ago, after years of enabling their rogue president, Republicans in Congress finally told President Nixon that it was time to go. Today, following the president's dangerous and seditious acts, Republicans in Congress need to follow that example and call on Trump to depart his office - immediately. If the president does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action," the speaker added.

## Call Upon Departmental New York Disciplinary Committee To Disbar Rudy Giuliani

Summary of [original article](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/call-upon-departmental-new-york-disciplinary-committee-to-disbar-rudy-giuliani/):

> Even before urging that a mob engage in "Combat" during a coup attempt, Rudy Giuliani was an embarrassment to the legal profession and was clearly incompetent as an attorney. I'm looking at Giuliani's Attorney Detail Report on the New York State Unified Court System website right now, and at the moment, he has no record of public discipline. Giuliani's given business address is 445 Park Ave., Floor 18, in Manhattan, making the Departmental Disciplinary Committee for the First Department the appropriate committee to address any complaints you may have to.

## They Were Out for Blood. The men who carried zip ties as they stormed the Capitol weren’t clowning around.

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/was-there-a-plan-for-hostages-or-killings-at-the-capitol.html?via=rss_socialflow_twitter):

> A bunch of cosplaying self-styled patriots show up, overwhelm the incomprehensibly unprepared Capitol Police, and then throw a frat party in the rotunda. These are the same guys who, when the windows of the Capitol were broken and entry secured, went in first with what I'd call military-ish precision. Today, we're hearing more about the violence that accompanied the buffoonery: the Capitol Police officer killed with a fire extinguisher, the AP photographer dragged away by goons, the New York Times photographer thrown to the floor who feared for her life.

`/u/kyahalhai08` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kt6zoq/they_were_out_for_blood_the_men_who_carried_zip/):

> > The guys were carrying  flex cuffs, the plastic double restraints often used by police in mass  arrest situations. They walked through the Senate chamber with a sense  of purpose. They were not dressed in silly costumes but kitted out in  full paramilitary regalia: helmets, armor, camo, holsters with sidearms.  At least one had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails. 
> 
> this is why we cannot allow anyone to downplay what happened. this was a terrorist attack, pure and simple, and it's a miracle it wasn't more successful.

## David Perdue concedes to Jon Ossoff, ending Georgia Senate runoffs

Summary of [original article](https://www.ajc.com/politics/david-perdue-concedes-to-jon-ossoff-ending-georgia-senate-runoffs/JLHHQVA6FZC7TPT3VJVCH4GZWM/):

> With Ossoff victory, Democrats cement Georgia as swing stateMore than 4.4 million people voted in the runoffs, which attracted intense national attention because of the high stakes of the races. Democrats sweep Georgia's runoffs, flip control of U.S. SenateBut he was undone by Ossoff in the nine-week runoff. From the outset, Ossoff focused his campaign on the anti-corruption work of his investigative journalism firm, and his criticism of Perdue dovetailed into reports of the Republican's well-timed stock trades.
