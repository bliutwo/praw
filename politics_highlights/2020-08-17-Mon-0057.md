## Political analysts say Kanye West may have committed election fraud

Summary of [original article](https://www.mic.com/p/political-analysts-say-kanye-west-may-have-committed-election-fraud-31136888):

> "Then yesterday, August 6, I got a call telling me what I actually signed was papers to get Kanye West on the ballot," Pernell wrote in her affidavit. All these allegations of suspect tactics employed to get West on the ballot could constitute election fraud, according to political experts. "If the affidavits are true crimes were committed by the West campaign," attorney Michael Maistelman, who gathered the affidavits for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

## US Postal workers reveal how 'ugly' their jobs have become under new leadership

`/u/AmbivalentAsshole` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ib4msx/us_postal_workers_reveal_how_ugly_their_jobs_have/):

> Postal workers do not get paid nearly enough for what they do. 
> 
> > Paid on an hourly wage at the post office, Servin relied on the overtime hours — often working around 60 hours a week — to support his wife and 4-year-old daughter. He said he needed those hours to cover rent, health insurance, and monthly car payments.
> 
> Both my parents were postal workers until they retired (mom was a postmaster in a small town working days, dad was a higher up at a hub working nights), and combined at basically a 18/20hr income per day, 5/7days week, we *barely* made it into the middle class. Just enough to *not* qualify for shit, and just too little to be able to afford what that next class would bring. Couple that with the fact that our medical insurance was *just* enough to cover the basics, but God forbid something bad happened growing up. My sister got the braces in the family, I didn't. Stuff like that. 
> 
> My mother literally worked until a doctor forced her to stop - she worked for 6 years with COPD keeping that office going, even had newspaper articles written about her and got local awards and recognition and shit, and then 2 years after she retired they *fucked* her retirement payments. Cut them by over 50%. I wasn't let in on the exact details, but seeing your mother hooked up to oxygen struggling not to cry over the fact that her *federal* employer financially *screwed* her when she basically worked herself to death for them, leaves you pretty goddamn bitter about it. 
> 
> Fuck how the postal workers are treated - they deserve much better pay and treatment. Fuck what they're doing to rig this election - it's hurting honest, hardworking people the most.

## We Need to Throw More Criminal Businesspeople in Jail

Summary of [original article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/08/donald-trump-doj-white-collar-crime-jail):

> After the 2008 financial crisis, the total lack of criminal accountability for those who crashed the economy was one of the chief complaints about the Obama Justice Department. Now in 2020 it is clear that corporate criminals are hard at work looting this country, and in the Trump Justice Department, they don't even need the get-out-of-jail-free card of being too big to jail. Writing in the New Republic, former financial fraud prosecutor Ankush Khardori listed the problems he has seen in the Trump Justice Department: "Relative disinterest in real-world fraud; an obliviousness to the sophistication of criminals who many see as nuisances but who are in fact wreaking widespread havoc; and high-level ineptitude by previously low-level prosecutors who somehow managed to rise quickly in recent years. Together, these trends point to the precarious state of our white-collar criminal enforcement program under the Trump administration."

## Bernie Sanders: 'I certainly did not sign' petition to get Kanye West on Wisconsin ballot

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/16/bernie-sanders-didnt-sign-get-kanye-west-wis-ballot/5594540002/):

> Sen. Bernie Sanders denied signing a petition to get Kanye West included on the presidential ballot in Wisconsin after reports that his name was among several contested signatures gathered by the musician's unorthodox campaign. West has already missed the deadline to make the ballot in many states, making it impossible for him to secure the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win in November. Republicans have been active in trying to get West added to the ballot and an attorney working for the Trump campaign helped West's campaign file his nomination papers in Wisconsin.

`/u/friz_lite` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ib076t/bernie_sanders_i_certainly_did_not_sign_petition/):

> IE Proof he committed election fraud. Throw his ass in jail, cowards.
