Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jr1dv4/the_what_happened_in_your_localdownballot/):

> Hi there, /r/politics! This week is a special edition of the "What happened in your state last week?" thread, focused entirely on what happened in your local elections. We all know the result of the Presidential Elections, this thread is not intended to rehash the 78 discussion threads we've had about that one. If someone from your state missed some results that you find important, feel free to comment with further results.

> My district elected a Qanon supporter who owns a restaurant called Shooters where staff carry a gun. She just got her GED this year. Not all of Colorado is progressive and liberal like most might think.

## Stop romanticizing divided government. If McConnell is majority leader, there will be no progress.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stop-romanticizing-divided-government-if-mcconnell-is-majority-leader-there-will-be-no-progress/2020/11/09/1d911d22-22c6-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html):

> It's the current Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell - to whom Senate custom gives nearly unilateral power to block most initiatives from ever getting a vote, compromises or efforts toward common ground be damned. Voters seem to like the idea of divided government on the premise that it incentivizes such shared victories. At least if McConnell continues running the show, as he almost certainly would if those Georgia seats remain Republican.

> This is why those two Georgia Senate runoffs in January are more important than ever. Godspeed, Stacey Abrams and Georgia voters

## For the good of the nation, let's not normalize any Trump flunkies with primetime TV cameos. Sean Spicer on "Dancing With the Stars" was the gateway, and look where we are now. Resist hiring Kayleigh McEnany

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/09/tv-trump-staff-kayleigh-mcenany-dancing-with-the-stars-sean-spicer/):

> Knowing what we know about how TV works, they're very likely to extend such as invitation to one of Trump's surrogates, perhaps in the name of moving past our differences or speeding along that healing process Joe Biden keeps talking about. Television normalized Trump in myriad ways during the years prior to his run for President and during the entirety of his campaign. "President Trump has continually condemned white supremacists and all forms of hate," the press secretary said ... as if only a few days earlier Trump did not tell the Proud Boys to "Stand back and stand by" in a nationally televised debate.
