## Bernie Sanders Says U.S. Can Cancel All Student Debt if It Can Give the Top 1% $1 Trillion in Tax Breaks

> It's never been about whether or not it's possible, it has always been about whether or not they're actually willing to do it.
> 
> Free healthcare for all is a thing in many countries. Free college is a thing. Parental leave, paid vacation. Countless things missing in most of the US are a thing in many other countries.
> 
> There is absolutely no reason why the US couldn't do the same for its people. It just comes down to whether or not the government is actually willing to provide for the people instead of the top 1%.
> 
> **Edit:** To clarify, I understand all the "free" stuff comes out of taxes. But the point stands because the tax increase required to cover these expenses is not that large. And as Bernie points out, if the US government can find ways to essentially gift a trillion dollars to the 1% in the form of tax cuts, they can also afford to cancel student debt without raising taxes.
> 
> And in regards to healthcare, the fact that health insurance exists in the US and is used not only for covering health care, but also paying for the salaries and office rent and benefits for all those countless thousands of insurance company workers, means that it's actually more expensive than universal healthcare would be, which would send your money almost directly to hospitals. No insurance company middle-men taking a huge cut. So you could still get the exact same health care, but also make sure you fellow man doesn't go bankrupt for life when they're hit by a car during that 1 month they were between jobs and without being able to afford insurance.

## Mueller prosecutor says Trump should be investigated and face charges after leaving office

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-investigation-crimes-mueller-andrew-weissman-b1762286.html):

> Mr Weissmann wrote: "As painful and hard as it may be for the country, I believe the next attorney general should investigate Mr Trump and, if warranted, prosecute him for potential federal crimes." The ex-prosecutor argued that while the Mueller investigation could not prove Russian ties to the US president or the 2016 US election, Mr Trump had not been exonerated by the report. At the time, president Trump was not charged with an obstruction of justice by Mr Mueller's team, who cited a 1973 Office of Legal Counsel memo that said a sitting president could not be indicted.

> > The ex-prosecutor argued that while the Mueller investigation could not prove Russian ties to the US president or the 2016 US election, **Mr Trump had not been exonerated by the report**. And in addition, **the team uncovered "ample evidence" that the president had obstructed justice** throughout the inquiry by threatening to dismiss Mr Mueller, among other actions. 
> 
> No, it wasn't a witch hunt and did not totally exonerate him. Don't get distracted, the whole motivation for challenging the election, pardons, chaos, etc. is all about saving his ass from prosecution once he no longer has immunity as president.

## Donor Sues Pro-Trump Group for $2.5 Million for Failing to Prove Voter Fraud

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/donor-sues-pro-trump-group-2-5-million-failing-prove-voter-fraud-1550457):

> A North Carolina money manager is suing a pro-Trump group for $2.5 million after the group failed to show evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election or provide him with updates on their efforts. Eshelman wired the group $2 million on November 5 and then sent them a further $500,000 the following week but True the Vote did not provide him with updates on their activities. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud or irregularities during the 2020 election despite the Trump campaign's ongoing and largely unsuccessful litigation efforts.

`/u/Not-original` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k1dsa2/donor_sues_protrump_group_for_25_million_for/):

> What I found interesting in the article was that after the donor complained, the "stop the steal" group offer him back 1 million dollars if he promised not to sue.  
> 
> It's almost like they knew all the time that there was no "steal" and this was just a fundraising opportunity.

## Black Lives Matter raising half a million for Democrats in Georgia Senate runoffs

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/black-lives-matter-fundraise-democrats-georgia-senate-elections-1550514):

> Black Lives Matter plans to raise $500,000 to help the campaigns of Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff as they look to overturn the Republican Senate majority in Georgia's runoff elections in January. In an email to voters seen by Fox News, the Black Lives Matter PAC said the outcome of Georgia's Senate races would have a direct impact on efforts to reform the criminal justice system, electoral processes and access to health care. "We know how important this election is going to be in determining what decisions will be made in the Senate for the next few years," the Black Lives Matter email, seen by Fox News, reportedly read. "Decisions that will impact us directly, like access to quality and affordable health care, reforming the criminal justice system, all the way to major electoral reform like passing the BREATHE Act.".
