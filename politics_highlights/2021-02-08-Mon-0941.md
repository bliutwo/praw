Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lfg7ej/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

## Ilhan Omar Warns Progressives Will Revolt If Dems 'Poison' Relief Bill by Curbing Eligibility for $1,400 Checks | "Democrats with a slim majority in the Congress can't pass this bill without progressives and must resist suggestions that will ultimately tank this relief bill.

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/02/08/ilhan-omar-warns-progressives-will-revolt-if-dems-poison-relief-bill-curbing):

> Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota warned Sunday that conservative Democrats' ongoing effort to further restrict eligibility for the new round of $1,400 direct payments risks shedding progressive support for a final coronavirus relief package-votes that the party, clinging to narrow majorities in the House and Senate, can't afford to lose. "Cutting the income cap will poison this bill. It already lacks Republicans support and will lose progressive support." -Rep. Ilhan Omar.Omar was referring to ongoing talks among Senate Democrats over whether to lower the annual income cutoff for the new round of relief checks with the stated goal of ensuring the payments are more closely "Targeted" to those in need. "There are some Dems who want to lower the income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals, and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples. In other words, working-class people who got checks from Trump would not get them from Biden. Brilliant!" Sen. Bernie Sanders-who along with Omar and others has been pushing for recurring relief payments for nearly a year-tweeted sardonically on Saturday night.

> The argument against curbing eligibility doesn’t need to be any more difficult than this: If this $1400 is supposed to follow the $600 to complete the $2k, then don’t cut it away from anyone who got the $600.
