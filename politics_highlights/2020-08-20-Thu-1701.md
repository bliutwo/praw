## Megathread: Former Trump Campaign Manager Steve Bannon Indicted & Arrested on Fraud Charges

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idcsk7/megathread_former_trump_campaign_manager_steve/):

> Post titles must be the exact headline from the article. Articles must be written in English An article must be primarily written in English for us to be able to moderate it and enforce our rules in a fair and unbiased manner. The ALL CAPS and 'Breaking' rule is applied even when the actual title of the article is in all caps or contains the word 'Breaking'.

> Good morning all. Every once in awhile we have a story that the userbase is probably interested in, and results in a large number of submissions, but many of the submitted stories are not on-topic under our rule. A lot of stories are not about politics, but may be politics-adjacent. Former political figures like Bannon (and Cain, recently) pose some of the largest difficulties in the on-topic rule because the rule is about current politics. For a much more extreme example, if a decade from now Kanye puts out an album, is that inherently on-topic because he was once a presidential candidate?
> 
> This story was difficult because several submissions did include a focus on current politics, with discussions about the relation to the Trump campaign (and therefore were on-topic), but most articles only discussed Bannon and the other figures involved with little context.
> 
> After some discussion, and reviewing the on-topic submissions that were flooding the frontpage, we determined a megathread was appropriate in this situation. We are using this situation and other recent politics-adjacent situations to review our on-topic rule and determine what changes may be necessary, though some difficult close calls are inevitable with any topicality rule.

## USPS arrested Steve Bannon. Yes, the post office can arrest people.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/20/21377305/postal-service-steve-bannon-arrest):

> The US Postal Service is out to deliver justice against former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. It's not immediately clear why the USPIS got involved since neither of the charges levied against Bannon - conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud - appear to be directly related to the mail, and the USPIS declined to comment on their investigation of Bannon, which is ongoing. The inspector in charge of the New York division of postal inspectors, Philip Bartlett, said in a statement that Bannon's indictment should send a message to other fraudsters: "No one is above the law."

> Fun fact: There are 86 government agencies with the power to arrest people!

## Opinion: I’m a gun totin’ Texas Republican, and I’m voting for Biden to preserve the Union

Summary of [original article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-republican-joe-biden-voting-election-2020-15495992.php):

> Recent polls show shows former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump neck and neck in the Lone Star State, including a University of Texas at Tyler poll with Biden ahead by 5 points. If there are any Texas Republicans out there who still feel like you need an excuse or permission to vote for Biden this fall, allow me to ease your way. I'm a gun totin' Texas property owner who called himself a Republican until 2016 when that title lost all meaning.

> At some point you have to put country over party. After the Senate Intelligence report it’s obvious that Trump is Putin’s puppet.

## "It's a Cover-Up": White House Accused of Hiding Mnuchin Role in Recruiting Postmaster General DeJoy | Documents obtained by a watchdog group reveal that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin met with the Postal Service Board of Governors in February "to discuss the search for a new postmaster general."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/20/its-cover-white-house-accused-hiding-mnuchin-role-recruiting-postmaster-general):

> Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday accused the Trump White House of covering up the role Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin played in recruiting Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major Republican donor with no prior experience working for the U.S. Postal Service. "This administration has repeatedly pointed to the role of Russell Reynolds to defend the selection of a Republican mega-donor with no prior postal experience as postmaster general while at the same time blocking the ability of Congress to obtain briefings from the firm and concealing the role of Secretary Mnuchin and the White House in its search process," the New York Democrat wrote. Schumer demanded that the Board of Governors-which is completely controlled by Trump appointees-immediately release Russell Reynolds from any nondisclosure agreement barring the firm from providing details about its postmaster general search and provide a full "Explanation of the role of President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin in the search process for a new postmaster and the selection of Mr. DeJoy."

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idejrn/its_a_coverup_white_house_accused_of_hiding/):

> >	"It's clear that Mnuchin had a candidate for postmaster general in mind, who was personally invested in USPS competitors," Sherman and Honl-Stuenkel continued. "The Washington Post reports that Louis DeJoy, the eventual pick, was recruited by Mnuchin."
> 
> The whole administration is corrupt. 
> 
> I think it’s time to check Mnuchin’s investments and see why he would want a Postmaster General that was invested in USPS competitors.

## USPS Warns Employees Not to Speak to Press

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7qypz/usps-warns-employees-not-to-speak-to-press):

> Memos are trickling down the United States Postal Service bureaucracy warning employees that they should not speak to the press and any customer asking lots of questions may be a journalist sneakily trying to get information out of them. The memos outline what employees should do if contacted by the media, and are titled "Guidelines for Handling Local Media Inquiries." Motherboard obtained two separate memos from postal employees in two districts. Typically, well-run organizations try and fix the problems the employees are talking about instead. If you're an employee with the USPS and know something the public ought to know, my email is aaron.

`/u/hildebrand_rarity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idhlzq/usps_warns_employees_not_to_speak_to_press/):

> They are sabotaging the Postal Service and now are telling their employees to not speak out about it. 
> 
> What kind of authoritarian state have we found ourselves in?
