## The Capitol Attack Is Looking More and More Like a Right-Wing Plot

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/01/the-capitol-attack-is-looking-more-and-more-like-a-right-wing-plot):

> Militia members reportedly strategized their attack on the Capitol both before it happened and as it played out, with designs on making "Citizens' arrests" of lawmakers. Not only had Tarrio, who Reuters reported Wednesday was previously an informant for law enforcement, heavily promoted the so-called "Stop the Steal" rally that preceded the siege; he also directed members on Parler to go "Incognito" at the event rather than wearing Proud Boys identification, and to work in "Smaller teams." And while he tried to minimize the role his group played in the attack in an interview with the Times, he spent the day of the insurrection cheering it on, praising the "Revolutionaries" on Parler and encouraging them to "Do what must be done." An exhaustive Wall Street Journal analysis found that the Proud Boys appeared to have coordinated and instigated major parts of the deadly attack. In a conference call to reporters Tuesday, federal law enforcement said there would be more arrests and charges against those involved, including for sedition, but declined to say if any elected officials were under legal scrutiny-or if the former president, his son Donald Trump Jr., or Rudy Giuliani could face charges for inciting the attack.

## Federal judges are retiring now that Joe Biden will pick their replacements.

Summary of [original article](http://www.huffpost.com/entry/federal-judges-retire-joe-biden_n_600f3759c5b676ad837652a8?rz):

> For at least one federal judge, it appeared that President Joe Biden couldn't be sworn in fast enough. While judges may, of course, have personal reasons for retiring or semi-retiring at the beginning of Biden's presidency, it's safe to say, for the most part, that the timing of these judges' departures isn't coincidental: They wanted Biden to pick their replacements, not Trump. "I think that Trump was so nasty to federal judges and so counter to the rule of law that he repelled many federal judges. I think for strong Democrats in particular, I could see judges saying, 'No, I'm not going to let him replace me.'".

> Here’s hoping Justice Breyer jumps on that bandwagon soon.

## Report: Biden Freezes F-35 Sale to UAE, Munitions Sales to Saudi Arabia

Summary of [original article](https://www.haaretz.com/amp/us-news/.premium-report-biden-freezes-f-35-sale-to-uae-munitions-sales-to-saudi-arabia-1.9488780?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&__twitter_impression=true&s=09):

> WASHINGTON - The Biden administration has reportedly temporarily frozen U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates as it reviews billions of dollars in weapons transactions approved by the Trump administration. According to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, citing U.S. officials, the United States is specifically reviewing the sale of Lockheed Martin F-35 jets to the UAE and munitions to Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during his confirmation hearings last week that the Biden administration would "Take a hard look" at the UAE sale.

> >"We have real concerns [about] the policies that our Saudi partners have pursued and, accordingly, the president-elect has said we will review the entirety of the relationship to make sure that, as it stands, it is advancing the interests [and is] respectful of the values that we bring to that partnership," Blinken said.

> That, sir, is an understatement.

## Elizabeth Warren and AOC slam Wall Streeters criticizing the GameStop rally for treating the stock market like a 'casino'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-warren-aoc-slam-wall-street-market-like-a-casino-2021-1):

> Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts slammed hedge funds and investors who were criticizing the traders driving up GameStop stock, saying they've treated the stock market "Like their own personal casino" and calling for stricter regulations. "For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price." While some commentators have said the rush to buy GameStop is just a way to "Meme-ify" a stock or a populist revolt against the big Wall Street firms and investors who run the markets, others, like Insider's Linette Lopez, said the GameStop surge could be a more nefarious scam or grift on the Redditors led by more experienced options traders.

`/u/Twoweekswithpay` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l6f5ft/elizabeth_warren_and_aoc_slam_wall_streeters/):

> > Elizabeth Warren: "With stocks soaring while millions are out of work and struggling to pay their bills, it's not news that the stock market doesn't reflect our actual economy." Warren said on Twitter. "For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price."
> 
> > Warren added: "It's long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do."  
> 
> > AOC: "Gotta admit it's really something to see Wall Streeters with a long history of treating our economy as a casino complain about a message board of posters also treating the market as a casino."
> 
> Hedge fund guys acting like GOP politicians: *’rules for thee, but not for me.’* Looks like the ‘Free Market’ isn’t so grand when it turns the tables on your rigged game. 🤨

## Democrat proposes move to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-congress-jimmy-gomez-b1793860.html):

> California congressman Jimmy Gomez moved on Wednesday to expel the hard-right representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress, after a number of past violent comments she endorsed on social media about Democratic officials came to light. "As if it weren't enough to amplify conspiracy theories that the September 11 attacks were an inside job and the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was staged, a string of recent media reports has now confirmed that Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had previously supported social media posts calling for political violence against the Speaker of the House, members of Congress, and former President Barack Obama," Mr Gomez, who represents parts of Los Angeles, said in a news release. Ms Greene began her term in Congress this year, but has already developed a reputation for supporting outrageous conspiracy theories like QAnon and making racist comments.
