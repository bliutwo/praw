## Top Dem Warns: Trump Will Invoke 'Some Kind Of Emergency' Action To Stay In Office

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clyburn-trump-emergency-election_n_5f26e0ddc5b6a34284bc1ef2):

> House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn on Sunday said he believes President Donald Trump won't leave the White House willingly should he lose the election in November and warned that the president might invoke an "Emergency" action to remain in office. Trump is "Deliberately orchestrating suppression and using the post office as a tool to do it," she said. Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller on Sunday downplayed Trump's suggestion of delaying the election.

## Morgues Are Overflowing in Mississippi and Coroners Are Terrified

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/amid-a-mississippi-coronavirus-surge-morgues-are-overflowing-and-coroners-are-scared):

> On April 3, as COVID-19 deaths in Mississippi hovered in the low double-digits, the state's chief medical examiner, Mark LeVaughn, fired off a letter to Meredith and the state's 80 other coroners. Over the last few weeks, Mississippi has emerged as something of a worst-case scenario in the country's coronavirus landscape: an already poor, sick, medically under-resourced state where both infections and deaths are rising faster than almost anywhere. The Mississippi Department of Health said in a statement that coroners can request test kits through their county Emergency Management Association, though multiple coroners canvassed by The Daily Beast said the supplies did not always arrive.

`/u/r1chard3` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2ft3f/morgues_are_overflowing_in_mississippi_and/):

> Just like New York in April. If only there had been some national coordination to spend the last three months getting ready.

## ‘This Push to Open Schools Is Guaranteed to Fail’ | It is time to stop pretending. Our children are staying home.

`/u/burn0uts0n` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2hft3/this_push_to_open_schools_is_guaranteed_to_fail/):

> I can tell ya from someone inside the schooling system, they have no idea what to do.  We have sat all summer long with no idea of what would be needed to do and now less then 3 weeks before school is to start, we are coming up with all sorts of half baked ideas to make the place safe.  Some ideas seem like good ones, others, just theater.  
> 
> If the time had been used productively at the start, we could have had a better idea of what to do.  If the government systems in place would actually hand down real guidelines instead of recommendations, that would be a big change in the way it’s “working” now.  
> 
> For what it’s worth, I’m glad I don’t have kids to deal with this mess but on the same hand, I’m fearful of how this will all go down.  I truly worry about the younger students that don’t care or think any of this is real and this bringing the threat of getting me sick more real.  I see a lot of head butting happening this season.

## Maryland’s highest court affirms that police can’t use the smell of marijuana to search and arrest a person

`/u/Hardest_Fart` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2eksq/marylands_highest_court_affirms_that_police_cant/):

> About fucking time.  Now they should go back and expunge anyone convicted where "I smell weed" was the probable cause.
> 
> I remember when I was a teen and had "I smell weed" used on me because I was out late with friends.  Those POS cops tore my vehicle apart, probably did about $1000 worth of damage, and found nothing.  Then, they told me that it wasn't their problem when I wanted them to help me put my vehicle back together.
> 
> Bullshit like that is why I never give cops the benefit of the doubt.

## Formerly incarcerated woman runs to be 1st Black woman in Congress from Tennessee

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/incarcerated-woman-runs-1st-black-woman-congress-tennessee/story?id=72031002):

> Along with supporting criminal justice reform and the Black Lives Matter movement, the 42-year-old Haynes is also passionate about issues such as providing access to affordable housing, raising the minimum wage and reducing student loan debt. Her historic run comes as a record number of Black women are running for Congress across the U.S. In 2019, a record number of Black women were serving in state legislative offices, according to The Center of American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Haynes' advice for young Black girls hoping to follow in her footsteps is to remember that you have the ability to make the impossible possible.

`/u/GhettoChemist` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2gmoc/formerly_incarcerated_woman_runs_to_be_1st_black/):

> She went to prison for marijuana. You know, that stuff now sold for profit that Republican and former House Majority leader John Boehner lobbies for in DC.
