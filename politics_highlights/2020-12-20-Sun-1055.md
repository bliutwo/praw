Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-meadows-tried-hide-threat-covid-19-public-report-says-2020-12):

> Mark Meadows attempted to keep the White House coronavirus outbreak a secret, even threatening to fire doctors if they leaked any information about it to the public, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. The White House chief of staff went above and beyond to hide information of the outbreak as the virus started to spread rapidly among his team in the fall, several officials told the Post. An unnamed official told the Post that Meadows told them that they were "Under no obligation to tell the press or the public that Joe Schmo who works in the White House has tested positive."

`/u/techblackops` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kgu736/trumps_chief_of_staff_mark_meadows_attempted_to/):

> I used to go to church with Mark Meadows and his family. After the last four years I no longer go to church, and am embarrassed that I was ever associated with Christian "evangelicals" like this prick. Mark Meadows was a chode back then and is an even bigger asshole now.

## In 2021, We Need To Fix America’s Internet - We Pay Twice As Much As Europe For High Speeds, Assuming We Can Even Get Them

`/u/Heavy-Valor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kgw006/in_2021_we_need_to_fix_americas_internet_we_pay/):

> Yes, definitely.  However, the Internet providers view the Internet as a "commodity" or utility, whose value or cost goes up over time.  Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T would fight any proposal in the FCC and legislation in Congress that would make the Internet a basic need, like food, clothing, and shelter.  Those companies have so much money to hand out to our representatives through their lobbyists that nothing will happen unfortunately.  As more and more people are canceling their cable TV subscriptions, the fight over Internet access will get really ugly.

> We had sanctions on Russia over Crimea, Trump removed them for no reason.
> 
> We need to put those back, and then more because of this attack, not to mention the publicly known interference on the 2016 election. At a minimum we need to get back to where we were, then look at what happened since 2016 and place punishment for those acts as well.
> 
> At an absolute minimum.
