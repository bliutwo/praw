## Operation Santa Is a Horror Story About American Poverty — Children have written requesting money for their parents, a bed to sleep in, and a better wheelchair to help them get around. There’s nothing feel-good about it.

Summary of [original article](https://newrepublic.com/article/160701/operation-santa-christmas-horror-story-american-poverty):

> Last year, Matt Bruenig of the People's Policy Project released "The Family Fun Pack," a comprehensive family welfare plan that would dramatically supplement the immense costs of raising a family in the United States: material supplies and paid parental leave are paired with free pre-K, childcare, health care, and a $300 monthly allowance. "The easiest solution to the problems posed by family life under capitalism is to levy broad-based taxes and then use the revenues from those taxes to fund a set of benefits that provide resources to families with children," Bruenig wrote. "Expanding SNAP benefits will do a lot in terms of also reducing child poverty because the way that SNAP is structured, it does not reach those families with the lowest incomes," Trisi said.

> My husband one day asked me what my favorite Christmas gift was growing up and I told him an electric blanket. My father kept the house so cold but I was allowed to turn on the blanket 15-30 minutes before going to bed so my bed would be warm at night. I feel like I was fortunate where we always had food and I received a couple new outfits a year. My stockings were always filled with school supplies and fresh fruit.

## $8 billion was spent on political ads during 2020. The election proved that money was mostly wasted.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-confirmed-free-media-is-better-than-political-ads-2020-12):

> In the Kennedy era of the 1960s or the Reagan era of the 1980s, political television ads swayed millions of votes. If the 2016 election started the conversation about whether traditional paid media is worth the money, then the 2020 election could very well have finished it. Even if TV ads gave them a crucial extra percentage point in key battleground states, can anyone really claim that $600 million in media was the best way to secure those votes? Is it possible there was a cheaper way? Or a free way?

`/u/BillyNutBuster` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kkiq40/8_billion_was_spent_on_political_ads_during_2020/):

> It is good to see that money has limits in politics. We are definitely hitting the point where there have been significant diminishing returns on political spending at the very least. The last several cycles, candidates who have raised and spent insane amounts of money have lost. That includes presidential elections. Not all of them, certainly, but it seems simply buying an election isnt as easy as thought.

## Mike Pence Cannot Block the Certification of Joe Biden’s Victory When the Senate Formally Counts Electoral College Votes on Jan. 6th

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/mike-pence-cannot-block-the-certification-of-joe-bidens-victory-when-the-senate-formally-counts-electoral-college-votes-on-jan-6th/):

> Chief among the latest exercises in futility is Trump imploring Vice President Mike Pence to prevent ratification of Joe Biden's victory when the Senate counts the Electoral College votes next month. The Electoral Count Act of 1887-which describes the process for counting Electoral College votes-stipulates that Pence open "All the certificates and papers purporting to be certificates of the electoral votes, which certificates and papers shall be opened, presented, and acted upon in the alphabetical order of the States." "Bottom line: There is no secret legal maneuver left to stop a Biden presidency. Pence & [Mitch] McConnell understand these rules & are in an awkward political position of their own sad making. Any drama before or on Jan 6 will be merely a pathetic show of Trump loyalty/cowardice," Shugerman concluded.

> I don’t think he was going to try to anyway. I thought I’d read that he was trying to distance himself from the trump shenanigans.

## Millions of Americans lose jobless benefits as Trump refuses to sign aid bill

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/millions-of-americans-lose-jobless-benefits-as-trump-refuses-to-sign-aid-bill-idUSKBN29003U):

> Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he said this week he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in badly needed coronavirus relief, including extending special unemployment benefits expiring on Dec. 26, and $1.4 trillion for normal government spending. Since then he has complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid, while its one-time $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans were too small. Democratic U.S. Representative Don Beyer told CNN that Trump can still save the day if he signed the bill Saturday.

> It's crazy how the whims of a few people can bring a country of 300million to a halt, let hundreds of thousands of people die during a pandemic let millions starve and lose their homes but still almost win an election

> Just curious. Does President Trump understand that if the election result is overturned in Congress, Nancy Pelosi will be sworn in as President?
