## White House backs bill to expand voting rights, curb gerrymandering

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/541028-white-house-backs-bill-to-expand-voting-rights-curb-gerrymandering):

> The White House on Monday formally threw its backing behind a massive voting rights bill that seeks to shore up voting rights and limit gerrymandering ahead of the 2021 redistricting cycle. "In the wake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy, a never before seen effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people, and a newly aggressive attack on voting rights taking place right now all across the country, this landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect the right to vote and the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen American democracy," the White House said in a statement of administrative policy. The bill would expand opportunities to vote by mail, require states to establish electronic voter registration, and would make Election Day a federal holiday.

## Trump took $10bn from hospital funds to pay for Warp Speed instead of asking Congress for cash

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-warp-speed-covid-funding-b1810688.html):

> The Trump Administration removed $10bn from a pot of money aimed to help hospitals and other healthcare providers endure the pandemic and put the money towards the Operation Warp Speed effort instead. The Department of Health and Human Services seem to have made a money move that allowed them to spend taxpayer funds without notifying Congress, and got permission from the top lawyer at the health department to go ahead with the plan, STAT reported. Operation Warp Speed was started by the Trump administration and not by Congress, so they used money that was already available, but in the late summer of 2020, Operation Warp Speed was running out of money. House Appropriations Committee Chair Democrat Rosa DeLauro told STAT: "It is unfortunate the Trump administration preferred to divert billions of dollars from the Provider Relief Fund instead of submitting a request to Congress for the necessary funds."

## Thereâ€™s No Evidence of Fake Trump Supporters or Antifa Among Capitol Rioters, FBI Director Tells Senate

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-siege/theres-no-evidence-of-fake-trump-supporters-or-antifa-among-capitol-rioters-fbi-director-tells-senate/):

> Demolishing a myth circulating in the political right following the U.S. Capitol insurrection, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate on Tuesday morning that two months of investigation has uncovered no signs that rioters falsely posing as former President Donald Trump's supporters were behind the violence. Pressed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, Wray added that he also found no evidence of involvement by antifa, an amorphous collective of left-wing and anti-fascist movements vilified by Trump and conservatives. Wray's testimony comports with that of his law enforcement partners at the U.S. Capitol police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, and the sergeants-at-arms for both branches of Congress, who uniformly told the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month that the violence at the Capitol was coordinated, included white supremacists and could have been much worse.
