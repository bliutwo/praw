## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 28

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oiu6wd/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> I'm not sure how the GOP didn't see that one coming, considering that the whole reason the special session was necessary was because they walked out before.
> 
> Still, it's a welcome development and it buys some desperately needed time. However, if the federal government doesn't do something, it'll all be for nothing.

## Republicans push to ban "discrimination" against unvaccinated people

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/republicans-coronavirus-vaccines-discrimination-law-states-533503fb-fa83-43d0-bd51-2d614483d241.html):

> State Republican lawmakers around the country are pushing bills - at least one of which has become law - that would give unvaccinated people the same protections as those surrounding race, gender and religion. Some state lawmakers are trying to make it illegal for employers, governments or private businesses to treat unvaccinated people any differently than vaccinated people, using the same language found in federal civil rights law. Yes, but: Legislation similar to Montana's has been introduced all over the country and would ban discrimination against unvaccinated people.

> While they promote discrimination against almost everyone else.

## Opinion: The latest CPAC lunacy shows why Democrats must get tougher

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/07/12/cpac-culture-war-democrats-strategy/):

> Which means Democrats must stop responding defensively to culture-war attacks, and come up with new ways to put Republicans on defense over it. In 2010, protesters confronted Democratic lawmakers with vile slurs and Republicans told endless lies about "Death panels." In 2014, the GOP went all-in on the lie that Obama would allow terrorists to import Ebola across our border. Ask yourself this: Why is it that Democrats spend far more time denying lies - that they want to indoctrinate your children with white shame and send jackbooted government thugs to kick down your doors and force vaccines on you - than Republicans spend denying any of those charges against them, which are true?

## NRA should be investigated for possible fraud, says Schumer

Summary of [original article](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-chuck-schumer-nra-bankruptcy-20210711-5hrj5gcupjhljhicazbf3rppiu-story.html):

> NRA should be investigated for potential fraud, says Schumer - New York Daily News The National Rifle Association may have committed fraud by trying to declare bankruptcy earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday, pointing to the gun group's heavy spending on advertisements. Now Schumer is calling on the Justice Department to investigate whether the NRA's bankruptcy claim amounted to fraud or other offenses. "The NRA said they were 'bankrupt' to escape the New York attorney general's jurisdiction," the New York Democrat said in a statement, "But it has been spending millions on ads, mailers, texts, TV and more to stop common-sense gun reforms like universal background checks and to hamper the just as gun violence spikes in cities across the country and here in New York.".
