> I want to thank Donald Trump for getting me so interested in politics. Before he began running, I was a casual observer. I was a registered Democrat, I voted, but didnt really pay attention.
> 
> Now? I not only know what the GSA is, I know the dates every state certifies their election, when the electoral college votes, how the electoral college works, why we should get rid of it, who Vladimir Putin is and why he’s a bad guy, what the senate and House of Representatives do, the entirety of the Watergate scandal, why it’s really dumb that Republicans calls themselves the party of Lincoln, why Mitch McConnell is the biggest douche in the universe, how easily fascism can rise and why we should fear it, and tons of other things.

> Then 8 years as Vice President, under our first African American president. He was also the first major Pres or VP to speak out for gay marriage (he said it even before Obama). Keep in mind, VP is a largely thankless job and is essentially a resume builder to be president.

## Jaime Harrison launches new PAC to help Democrats in Georgia runoffs as he eyes DNC chair

Summary of [original article](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/jaime-harrison-launches-new-pac-to-help-democrats-in-georgia-runoffs-as-he-eyes-dnc/article_87349c7e-2dbe-11eb-834d-174dfc9ff8ee.html):

> In his first post-election interview with The Post and Courier since losing the Senate race, Harrison said he wanted to create the PAC to build on the enthusiasm he was able to generate from Democrats across the country en route to becoming the best-funded U.S. Senate candidate in American history. The PAC is named after a story Harrison often told on the campaign trail about a South Carolinian he spoke to in a previous election cycle who had seen Republicans and Democrats repeatedly knock on his door to ask for his vote over the years only to consistently fail to pave the dirt road in front of his house, the one issue he cared about most. Beyond the Georgia runoffs, Harrison said the PAC will engage in the off-year 2021 races in Virginia and broadly assist other Democratic candidates and parties in southern, rural states.

`/u/sumo_kitty` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k03olk/jaime_harrison_launches_new_pac_to_help_democrats/):

> If democrats had half a brain they would have Stacy Abrams lead the DNC. She appeals to the base and she is very effective at getting people to come out and vote.

## Yes, the Biden administration should hold Trump accountable

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/24/yes-biden-administration-should-hold-trump-accountable/):

> As White House tapes revealed, Nixon falsely assured some of his co-conspirators that, "When the president does it, it isn't illegal." Trump has publicly advanced an even more sweeping claim: In resisting grand jury subpoenas issued by New York state authorities for his tax records, Trump declared that a president enjoys "Absolute immunity" from even being investigated for possible crimes. The problem I saw with Ford's pardon of Nixon also applies to giving Trump a pass: Doing so would effectively treat a president, even if a former president, as above the law. Although Biden is unlikely to issue a formal pardon to his predecessor, even deliberately ignoring Trump's crimes would similarly signal that a president is not subject to equal justice under the law.

`/u/SupremeWizardry` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/k06l7z/yes_the_biden_administration_should_hold_trump/):

> Install a proper AG, remove the unqualified loyalists from other parts of the DOJ. Let them spearhead this, I'd rather not see Biden commenting directly.
> 
> I want him and his family to answer for the crimes committed, but not at the risk of making Joe look vengeful early in his term.
