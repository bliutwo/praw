## I am the Ashlee Wright from The Satanic Temple’s Religious Reproductive Rights campaign here to answer your questions about TST’s Satanic abortion ritual. AMA!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/igg7ms/i_am_the_ashlee_wright_from_the_satanic_temples/):

> The Satanic Temple has announced that its Satanic abortion ritual exempts TST members from enduring medically unnecessary and unscientific regulations when seeking to terminate their pregnancy. Because these procedures contravene Satanists' religious convictions, those who perform the religious abortion ritual-which involves the recitation of two of our tenets and a personal affirmation that is ceremoniously intertwined with the abortion-are exempt from these prerequisite procedures and can receive first-trimester abortions on demand. To watch our announcement video and to learn more about the Satanic abortion ritual, its procedure, and specific legal exemptions, visit: https://announcement.

> Even worse, he utterly refused to take responsibility for the actions he's taken, preferring to blame them on persons or causes unknown. What a shady ass liar. And so disrespectful of Congress, which means disrespectful of Americans, you and me.

## How the Satanic Temple Could Bring Abortion Rights to the Supreme Court | By using the same religious liberty argument as Hobby Lobby, The Satanic Temple is trying to have its members exempted from state abortion laws

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/satanic-temple-abortion-rights-supreme-court-1048833/):

> For years now, The Satanic Temple has fought to expand religious liberty notions that the conservative Supreme Court has applied to Christians to apply to its members as well. The Satanic Temple has made these claims in multiple state and federal court cases on behalf of members who were pregnant and sought an abortion at the time the lawsuits were filed. There's reason to doubt whether the Court will apply these principles neutrally, but if it does, The Satanic Temple may eventually win.

`/u/EHorstmann` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/igbofj/how_the_satanic_temple_could_bring_abortion/):

> Conservatives: no no no! We didn’t mean for religious freedom to extend to *everyone*! Just us!

## Don't cry for Kellyanne Conway: Like the whole corrupt Trump enterprise, she must pay. When this nightmare ends, some Democrats will want to "move on." Forget it — criminals like Conway must be judged

> More than anything, this election is about restoring law and order. While it may be tradition to forgive lesser crimes in an effort to heal, our justice system has been so brazenly flouted by this administration that justice ought to be served.

## The rabbi who is neighbor to Mark and Patricia McCloskey speaks out: ‘They are bullies’

Summary of [original article](https://forward.com/news/national/453183/the-rabbi-who-is-neighbor-to-mark-and-patricia-mccloskey-speaks-out-they/):

> When Rabbi Susan Talve heard that Patricia and Mark McCloskey would be among the speakers addressing the Republican National Convention, she decided she could no longer stay quiet. "Certain people on Portland Place, for political reasons, wanted to make it a gay issue," Mark McCloskey told The Post-Dispatch. The rabbi who is neighbor to Mark and Patricia McCloskey speaks out: 'They are bullies'.

`/u/death_by_chocolate` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/igbejr/the_rabbi_who_is_neighbor_to_mark_and_patricia/):

> Well of course they are bullies--bullies with money and law degrees. And guns. Don't ever think that when Trump or the RNC yaks about 'freedoms' that are in danger of 'being lost' that the are talking about anything other than the freedom that these two utilize: the freedom to threaten, to intimidate, or to compel at gunpoint anyone who fails to kiss the ring. Why? Because fuck you that's why.

## Joe Biden gave his convention speech live. Rush Limbaugh’s claim that it ‘had to be taped’ is wrong

Summary of [original article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/24/rush-limbaugh/joe-biden-gave-his-convention-speech-live-rush-lim/):

> Former Vice President Joe Biden capped off the virtual Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20 with a nearly 25-minute speech delivered live to a room of reporters, camera crews, campaign staffers and Secret Service agents at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. In the days since, radio host Rush Limbaugh and other conservative media personalities have falsely claimed that Biden's speech was pre-taped and edited to remove any mess-ups. Joe Biden is shown from above as he speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20, 2020, at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. Some supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee watched the speech from their cars as it was displayed on a screen in a nearby parking lot. Limbaugh said Biden's convention speech "Had to be taped in segments, and the segments had to be edited together."

> Wait, you mean to tell me rush Limbaugh lied to push a political agenda? Go on and tell another one!!
