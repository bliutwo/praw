> 
> Edit: Nope, not accepting that we can't fix it. We are going to fix ourselves, dammit. This is not the end of us, but it could be if we don't work on the problems that we've identified. Stop assigning blame, and work on solutions. We've done it before, we can do it again. All we're doing now is fighting each other.

> It’s a big deal for healthcare providers. Every time I find a new job I have to look at their non compete clause and make sure it doesn’t include the entire city I’m moving too so if I leave the job I don’t also have to move to a different city. It’s really dumb.

## Liz Cheney’s role on Jan. 6 committee grows after GOP pulls participation

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/liz-cheney-s-role-jan-6-committee-grows-after-gop-n1274920):

> WASHINGTON - In May, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was stripped of her role as the third-ranking Republican in the House by fellow party members who said they had tired of her frequent and vocal opposition to former President Donald Trump's false claims of massive election fraud, as well as her vote to impeach him for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. When House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., pulled his own Republican appointees this week, Cheney's role as the sole GOP member has only grown, Democratic aides and lawmakers told NBC News.She may not be alone for long - Pelosi said Sunday she will try to add another Trump critic, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., to the panel in an effort to bulk up Republican participation - but her role will still be distinct. In one meeting with the committee members, Pelosi raised a glass of water, saying, "Let us salute Liz Cheney for her courage."

## Arizona GOP lawmaker booed off stage at Trump 'Protect Our Elections' rally

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-gop-lawmaker-booed-off-stage-trump-protect-our-elections-rally-1612845):

> Arizona State Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita was booed off stage at a rally featuring former President Donald Trump. Ugenti-Rita, a Republican, was immediately met with a chorus of loud boos after taking the stage at a "Protect Our Elections" rally hosted by Turning Point Action in Phoenix on Saturday. Trump appeared on stage later in the evening, where he repeated baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and prompted boos for his former vice president, Mike Pence, after attacking him for not stopping the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.

`/u/Lesley82` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/orayeh/arizona_gop_lawmaker_booed_off_stage_at_trump/):

> Whenever I feel a little bad for the very few Republican elected officials who have been weakly fighting against the Trump cult, I remember that the party has been anti-democracy for at least 30 years and they knew that when they signed up.
