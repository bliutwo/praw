## Filling Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat would be a disastrous Republican move — If Republicans force a Trump nominee onto the Supreme Court and Democrats sweep the election, bygones won't be bygones. There will be retribution.

## Nancy Pelosi refuses to rule out second impeachment of Trump to delay Supreme Court battle

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/nancy-pelosi-refuses-rule-out-second-impeachment-trump-delay-supreme-court-battle-b507574.html):

> Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday did not dismiss the idea that House Democrats might impeach Donald Trump again in order to force the Senate to hold a trial in removing him from office in order to delay a battle over the president's coming nomination to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. The move would be an unprecedented one for Ms Pelosi and Democrats, but in the extreme year that is 2020 and with America's politics so divided, just about no one in Washington is ruling out anything as Republicans try to install a 6-3 conservative lean on the highest court in the land and Democrats scramble to try delaying a vote until after Election Day - or even into next year. Democrats are pressing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to follow the path he set in 2016, when he blocked then-President Barack Obama's final high court nominee, Merrick Garland, arguing voters should speak first about who they wanted as president.

> Go get him. America needs a win.

## Trump supporters staged a rally at a Virginia polling center during early voting, intimidating voters, election officials say

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/virginia-trump-supporters-intimidated-voters-disrupt-early-voting-2020-9):

> Supporters of President Donald Trump staged a rally during early voting at a polling station in Virginia on Saturday, in a stunt that an election official said had intimidated voters and disrupted voting. According to footage of the incident posted online by filmmaker Anthony Tilghman, a group of supporters holding up pro-Trump banners staged the protest near the polling station entrance in Fairfax, on the second day of early voting in the state. A county election official, Gary Scott, said that the protest was about 100 feet from the building entrance where voters cast their ballot early.

`/u/SingularityWalker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/iwe209/trump_supporters_staged_a_rally_at_a_virginia/):

> Yet the police did nothing to stop this illegal activity and remove these people who are defined as having been involved in a terrorist activity of voter intimidation.
> 
> The United States as a democracy is dying and the police are literally helping the terrorists with their selective, biased, racist inequitable enforcement of the law.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mocks-msnbc-anchor-shot-rubber-bullet-a-beautiful-sight-2020-9):

> President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Minnesota Saturday gloated over MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi being hit by a rubber bullet fired by police at a recent anti-racism protest. The president spoke to supporters about the anti-racism protests that swept America over the summer, and the occasionally violent and indiscriminate police tactics used to suppress them that Trump has endorsed. During the speech, Trump recalled an incident during anti-racism protests in Minneapolis in May in which police fired at MSNBC's Velshi and his camera crew were fired on by law enforcement.
