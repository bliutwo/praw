Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/26/mike-pompeo-under-investigation-corrupt-and-likely-unlawful-rnc-speech-jerusalem):

> Shortly before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's prerecorded speech from Jerusalem aired during the Republican National Convention Tuesday night, the House of Representatives launched an investigation into the top American diplomat's "Likely unprecedented" and potentially unlawful decision to address the partisan event while overseas on taxpayer-funded government business. As Common Dreams reported earlier this week, news that Pompeo would deliver a convention speech while on an official trip to Israel was met with alarm by legal experts and commentators, who condemned the move as unethical and "An outrageous exploitation of religion" in the service of President Donald Trump's reelection efforts. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at the RNC from a work trip in Jerusalem, after warning State Dept.

> >	"Congress has a responsibility to stand up for the rule of law and hold them accountable for this corrupt behavior," said Castro. "It's absolutely unacceptable that a sitting U.S. Secretary of State, America's top diplomat, would use official taxpayer-funded business to participate in a political party convention, particularly after the State Department published guidance that explicitly prohibits such activity."

> Laws donâ€™t matter to this administration, they have made that clear.

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/26/former-one-america-news-correspondent-emily-miller-gets-senior-fda-post/):

> Emily Miller, a gun-rights advocate and former senior correspondent for the right-wing One America News Network, has been appointed as assistant commissioner for media relations at the embattled Food and Drug Administration, Miller confirmed in a tweet. On the day Miller took over as FDA spokesperson, the agency issued an unusually-worded press release describing the FDA's emergency authorization of convalescent plasma in COVID patients as "Another achievement" in the Trump administration's fight against the coronavirus. Two months earlier, in reference to averaged trend lines in charts posted by former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Miller asked, "What's the dotted line through the death chart?".

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mail-disruption-under-trump-aligned-postmaster-unconstitutional-ny-attorney-general-2020-08-25?mod=home-page):

> NEW YORK - New York's attorney general added Tuesday to the growing pile of lawsuits seeking to halt disruptions to the U.S. Postal Service ahead of November's presidential election, saying several communities in her state have gone some days without mail. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy recently announced that he was suspending new operational changes to mail service amid complaints that they had led to delivery slowdowns. Some New York communities saw mail delivery skipped on at least three days in July and August; boxes of mail slated for delivery on Aug. 7 were still sitting in a Bronx postal facility a week later; and 173 Express Mail packages sent to the Buffalo area went undelivered from Aug. 10-12, the lawsuit said.
