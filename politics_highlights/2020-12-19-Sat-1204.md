## Warren reintroduces bill to bar lawmakers from trading stocks

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/530968-warren-reintroduces-bill-to-bar-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks):

> Sen. announced Friday she's reintroducing a bill to prohibit lawmakers from trading stocks as Democrats look to make the issue a key aspect of Georgia's two Senate runoffs. Democrats have accused the two senators, who are locked in competitive runoffs to keep their seats, of using private information gleaned from congressional briefings to buy and sell stocks during the pandemic. "After nearly four years of the most corrupt president in American history and with U.S. senators brazenly trading stocks to profit off a raging pandemic, the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act is more urgent than ever in order to rein in corruption, strengthen ethics, end lobbying as we know it, improve the integrity of our judiciary, reform campaign finance laws and finally ensure that we put people over profits and communities over corporations," Warren and Jayapal said in a joint statement.

`/u/kingofturtles` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kg8jzx/warren_reintroduces_bill_to_bar_lawmakers_from/):

> But if lawmakers can't trade stocks, how else will they make money by capitalizing on their position?  Surely they can't be expected to do such a big job with only... $174k/year.  (/s in case it wasn't clear)

## AOC says the GOP 'just doesn't care' about struggling Americans as stimulus talks get pushed into the weekend

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/aoc-gop-just-doesnt-care-impact-covid-19-stimulus-talks-2020-12):

> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed the GOP's handling of coronavirus stimulus talks on Thursday, saying that it feels like the Republican Senate majority " just doesn't care" about the impact it could have on ordinary Americans. Ocasio-Cortez, whose New York City district was particularly hard hit by the virus, also claimed that Republicans are "More passionate about corporate liability protections and essentially corporate immunity and they don't want to authorize unemployment or stimulus checks." The New York congresswoman has been very vocal about the ongoing stimulus talks, saying earlier this week that there's a sense of "Urgency" because she thinks Republicans could block Democratic efforts for a larger stimulus package if the Democrats fail to control the Senate.

`/u/aesdlyvesactnttc` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kg7omf/aoc_says_the_gop_just_doesnt_care_about/):

> To anyone that feels that a stimulus check isn't due then I invite you to drive by a foodbank today and look at the line. Look at the people who are in line. Most of them are still technically employed but have seen their hours cut, their costs for work go up, and their lives generally thrown into turmoil.
> 
> People that are unemployed are suffering but to think they are the only ones is to stick your head in the sand and ignore the obvious.

## Republicans strategize for next elections: 'Their plan is to make it harder for voters to participate'

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/19/republicans-strategize-future-elections-harder-to-vote?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other):

> "There will be some states where it is very clear that the existing power structure is worried about their voters. And part of their job security plan is to make it harder for their voters to participate," said Myrna Pérez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. In Georgia, a state where record numbers of voters cast their ballots by mail, Republicans who control the state legislature have said they want to pass a slew of new restrictions focused on mail-in voting. After the 2008 presidential election, Republicans took control of state legislatures in 2010 and were more likely to pass voting restrictions in places where there were high minority populations or high turnout among minority voters.
