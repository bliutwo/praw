## McConnell Admits to Sabotaging COVID Relief Talks to Rush Barrett Confirmation

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/mcconnell-admits-to-sabotaging-covid-relief-talks-to-rush-barrett-confirmation/):

> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his Republican colleagues Tuesday that he has privately been urging the Trump White House not to strike a coronavirus relief deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before the November 3 election, warning that an agreement could interfere with his chamber's plan to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court early next week. With a comprehensive relief package in doubt in large part due to his own obstruction, McConnell on Tuesday held a procedural vote on a plan to extend an additional $260 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says his COVID relief bill does not include another round of stimulus checks for Americans.

> I think this will answer Biden's question on "how they do it." Breaking the rules to force it through as fast as possible should guarantee changes to the SC should the dems win the presidency and the senate.

## 56 percent in new poll say Trump does not deserve reelection

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/522206-56-percent-in-new-poll-say-trump-does-not-deserve-reelection):

> Fifty-six percent of voters told Gallup that the president does not deserve a second term, compared to just 43 percent who said that he is worthy of another four years in the Oval Office. The percentage of those who say that Trump deserves reelection has dropped 7 points since January, Gallup noted, and comes as the survey giant found that 55 percent of Americans say they disapprove of the president's overall job performance. ADVERTISEMENT. Just 43 percent of Americans said in a poll released Wednesday that they support the president's overall performance, with a 90-point gap between Republicans and Democrats, 94 to 4 percent, in that category.

> Let's see what the article says.
> 
> "The court accepted every fact of the case but determined that Wooten shouldn’t even stand trial. They essentially ruled that Wooten was immune from the consequences of his actions because “the only right [Day] can assert would be the right of an out-of-breath arrestee to not have his hands cuffed behind his back after he complains of difficulty breathing.” However, the judges woefully admitted that they could “find no Seventh Circuit precedent clearly establishing such a right.”
