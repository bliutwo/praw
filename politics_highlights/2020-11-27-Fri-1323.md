## Trump’s First Instinct Was to Threaten Overhaul of Internet Law as #DiaperDon Trended

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/opinion/trumps-first-instinct-was-to-threaten-overhaul-of-internet-law-as-diaperdon-trended/):

> For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! For months, Trump and his supporters have made repeal of Section 230 a major talking point. Whatever logic may exist as to a hypothetical repeal or amendment of Section 230, the president's assertion that the change must be done in the interest of "National security" is baffling.

> I can't stop laughing at this. Guy wakes up in the middle of the night to have his normal midnight fast food dump and logs on Twitter. Sees #diaperdon trending and gets so furious. Like extremely angry. No way he's getting back to sleep now. He's the president and they still mock him. How did one man become so impotent? And he does what all impotent men do, scream and rage and make empty threats. God January can't come soon enough.

## Trump declares Twitter national security threat after #DiaperDon trends following meltdown

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-twitter-diaperdon-election-press-conference-b1762682.html):

> Donald Trump has angrily declared Twitter a national security threat after #DiaperDon went viral following a news conference in which he repeatedly complained about perceived injustices. Mr Trump did not say which trending topic upset him, but following Thursday's press briefing, which saw him furiously assail a reporter from behind a surprisingly small desk, the hashtag #DiaperDon surged towards the top of Twitter's trending list in the US and UK. "For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!" Mr Trump added, in reference to part of a 1996 law which protects websites from lawsuits over content posted by users. "We made #DiaperDon the number one trend in the US," the group tweeted, adding: "Trump had a meltdown and wanted to declare Twitter trends a national security threat."

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/27/perdue-traded-hundreds-of-thousands-worth-of-bank-stocks-while-on-senate-banking-committee/):

> David Perdue, one of two multimillionaire Georgia Republican senators facing insider-trading scrutiny ahead of runoff elections in January, traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank stock while passing pro-bank legislation on the Senate Banking Committee, financial disclosures show. The latest stock news also creates a new context for assessing Perdue's personal involvement in prior trades, such as millions of dollars in transactions while he served on the Banking Committee. The forms do show that between 2017 and 2020, while he sat on the Banking Committee, Perdue traded at a minimum hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions.
