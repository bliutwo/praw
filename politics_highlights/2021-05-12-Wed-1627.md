> Why do Republican Senators have doubts about election results in democratic leaning counties and not throughout the state in general? Isn’t this suspicious behavior on their part? What are their doubts really?

## Biden officials testify that white supremacists are greatest domestic security threat

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/553161-biden-officials-testify-that-white-supremacists-are-greatest):

> The Biden administration's top law enforcement officials on Wednesday pledged to dedicate their resources to combat domestic violent extremists amid questions over whether the agencies are equipped to monitor such threats in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Both Garland and Mayorkas testified that white supremacist groups pose the most serious domestic national security threat in the U.S., reinforcing what analysts have long concluded about far-right organizations. ADVERTISEMENT. "Domestic violent extremists pose an elevated threat in 2021 and in the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat we face comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race," Garland told lawmakers at the top of the hearing.

## Joe Manchin is wrong — D.C. statehood is constitutional

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/553035-joe-manchin-is-wrong-dc-statehood-is-constitutional):

> ADVERTISEMENT. Yet nothing in the Constitution's text forbids admitting D.C. to statehood. Opponents of D.C. statehood are thus left insisting that the Founders' concerns are "Still valid." What, in other words, would James Madison do? In deciding on statehood, Congress split up territories, shifted their boundaries, or withheld them from statehood for decades.

`/u/BlotchComics` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nat5q3/joe_manchin_is_wrong_dc_statehood_is/):

> No shit. Just ask all of the other states that were added without amendments.
