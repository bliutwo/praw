> Her mannerisms when it comes to voting and mocking the government as a whole. She sees this as a game that doesn't affect her. She is playing with sims and threw us all into a pool with no ladder and she sits and laughs as we drown because she doesn't care. Once her career is over she will move onto corporate work and keep being a millionaire.

## Trump Ally Allegedly Told Arizona Official 'We Need You To Stop the Counting': Report

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-ally-allegedly-told-arizona-official-we-need-you-stop-counting-report-1606611):

> The head of Arizona's Republican Party, an ally of former President Donald Trump, reportedly demanded that officials stop counting votes while the ex-president was losing the state to President Joe Biden last year. Newly released records show that at some point during the election's aftermath, Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward texted former Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman and demanded, "We need you to stop the counting," according to The Associated Press. Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington told The New York Times that "It's no surprise Maricopa County election officials had no desire to look into significant irregularities during the election."

> No way, the guy who wrote a book about “never ever ever admit you lost or were defeated, spin everything into a win” and called it the art of the deal, like being born rich is a skill….. tried to cheat to win?! And when he lost projected that onto the people that beat him?!
> 
> Honestly what dejoy was trying to do at the post office is super messed up. It all is.

## Michigan's push to end gerrymandering offers 'hope' for the divided nation, advocates say

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michigan-s-push-end-gerrymandering-offers-hope-divided-nation-advocates-n1272989):

> A commission charged with redrawing Michigan's political boundaries was preparing to make crucial decisions that could affect the future of the state - and even the nation. Gerrymandering in Michigan 10 years ago, after the last census, was so effective for the Republican Party that the GOP has maintained a majority in both legislative houses for the last decade, though Democrats have won a majority of votes in some elections, including 2018 when they swept four statewide offices and earned more votes in legislative races overall. Tori Sachs, the executive director of the conservative Michigan Freedom Fund, whose former director filed a lawsuit last year to stop the commission, said in a statement that the focus on communities of interest seems like just another form of gerrymandering.

`/u/ThirtyThreeInTwenty1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ocuq6s/michigans_push_to_end_gerrymandering_offers_hope/):

> >A Methodist pastor requested a district that would consider the needs of religious voters, keeping churchgoers together.
> 
> This is basically Michigan when you get west of Lansing and north of Flint. A bunch of people trying to figure out how they can keep their religion in our political system.

## Texas Lt. Gov. Says State History Museum No Place for History

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/07/texas-lieutenant-govenor-dan-patrick-cancel-culture-alamo-bullock-history-museum-tomlinson-burrough-stanford/?ref=upstract.com&curator=upstract.com&utm_source=upstract.com):

> On Thursday evening, two Texas writers, Chris Tomlinson and Bryan Burrough, were supposed to give a talk at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin about Forget the Alamo, a new book they co-authored with Jason Stanford. When the museum first opened, as University of Texas historian Monica Muñoz Martinez recounted in her book, The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas, it was criticized by historians for the way it repackaged the sanitized pseudo-history of Anglo Texas. The institution had improved enough that it played host to a fairly remarkable exhibit-"Life and Death on the Border, 1910-1920." The installation, which Martinez helped plan as part of a group of historians and activists called "Refusing to Forget," told the story of state violence inflicted on people of Mexican descent in Texas in the early 20th century-a contrast to the hagiography with which state organs have talked about the Texas Rangers in the past.

> Please don't tell the Texas GOP that the hero Sam Houston was against the state joining the confederacy and was impeached and removed from office.
> 
> On April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:
> 
> "Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South."

> >"January 6 represents the framers' nightmare," Rosen told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on "The Takeout" podcast this week. "This is a nonpartisan statement. It's a statement of fact to say that **what they most feared was armed mobs interrupting the peaceable engines of government**."
> 
> McCarthy's messaging: It was perfectly innocent and we don't need to investigate. Also, if anyone investigates, they will be punished.
