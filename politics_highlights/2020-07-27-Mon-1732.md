> There's gonna be a meeting this Wednesday to see if the superintendent of the fifth largest school district in the country is going to get fired for lying to the Legislature.   In short: One of the bills that was under consideration during the special session allowed the CCSD to take any surplus money from individual schools and use it to fill its budget gap.  Superintendent told the school board and the Legislature that the language came from the Governor and Nevada Department of Education, when in reality it came from him.  Sisolak and the State Superintendent called him out for lying about it, and here we are.

## There Is Nothing Conservative About What Trump Is Doing in Portland | Unconstitutional police activity is not conservative. It’s authoritarian.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/portland-conservative/614626/):

> There is nothing conservative about unconstitutional police activity, and there is nothing conservative about unilateral federal intervention in state affairs. If repairing the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they protect was difficult before, the president's unilateral intervention into local affairs has made it impossible. Tom Ridge, who served as the first homeland-security secretary, under President George W. Bush, echoed that concern: DHS "Was not established to be the president's personal militia." One of us, Paul Rosenzweig, served as the deputy assistant secretary for policy at DHS during the George W. Bush administration.

`/u/x86_64Ubuntu` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hyvycw/there_is_nothing_conservative_about_what_trump_is/):

> It’s amazing how with every Republican president there is always a “rehab session” about how what they did and what they were elected for isn’t “conservative “

> Hundreds of family planning clinics have lost federal funding because of new rules enacted by President Donald Trump's administration, but presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is pledging to bring the money back. The former vice president said Monday he will restore funding to Planned Parenthood as part of his "Agenda for Women" proposal. "As President, Biden will reissue guidance specifying that states cannot refuse Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other providers and reverse the Trump Administration's rule preventing these organizations from obtaining Title X funds."

## Trump's fascist crackdown is a political stunt — Democrats should impeach him again

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/07/27/trumps-fascist-crackdown-is-a-political-stunt--democrats-should-impeach-him-again/):

> In an article published Friday, the Washington Post reported that "Trump's campaign officials say that the president wants to amplify his law-and-order message" and that Portland was chosen not because of any real threat to anyone's safety in the city, but because Trump and his aides felt it was the best "Theater for his fight." Trump has shown far more interest in this campaign stunt - one that involves tear-gassing, beating and terrorizing real people for the purposes of campaign advertising - than he ever has in the fight against the coronavirus. Back in December, Trump was caught red-handed in the act of trying to cheat in the 2020 elections by using his office's powers to blackmail the president of Ukraine to aid a smear campaign against Trump's Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.

## Tom Cotton — a small, fragile white man who wants your vote in November — thinks slavery was a 'necessary evil'

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tom-cotton-slavery-1619-project-necessary-evil-twitter-a9640521.html):

> Tom Cotton has proven himself to be a man of no morals at all. Which is to say nothing of the fact that people will vote for Tom Cotton in November. The life of a Black human being, inscribed in a history book, does not matter, because that human being built something that belongs to Tom Cotton, and Tom Cotton is afraid of losing his foothold in America.

`/u/thepartypantser` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hyuj5h/tom_cotton_a_small_fragile_white_man_who_wants/):

> I am just going to keep posting this on every thread on Tom Cotton.
> 
> Tom Cotton said:
> 
> >America is a great and noble country founded on the proposition that all mankind is created equal. We have always struggled to live up to that promise, but no country has ever done more to achieve it.”
> 
> On why DC residents do not deserve representation in congress Tom Cotton also said:
> 
> >"Wyoming is smaller than Washington by population, but it has three times as many workers in mining, logging and construction, and 10 times as many workers in manufacturing. In other words, Wyoming is a well-rounded working-class state. A new state of Washington would not be"
> 
> Sounds like all people aren't quite equal in his eyes.
> 
> I guess that some of us are still striving for equality, but you have given up now haven't you Tom?
