> There's gonna be a meeting this Wednesday to see if the superintendent of the fifth largest school district in the country is going to get fired for lying to the Legislature.   In short: One of the bills that was under consideration during the special session allowed the CCSD to take any surplus money from individual schools and use it to fill its budget gap.  Superintendent told the school board and the Legislature that the language came from the Governor and Nevada Department of Education, when in reality it came from him.  Sisolak and the State Superintendent called him out for lying about it, and here we are.

## Trump Needed to Be Told Republicans Were Getting Sick to Take Action on Coronavirus, Report Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-needed-to-be-told-republicans-were-getting-sick-to-take-action-on-coronavirus-report-says?via=newsletter&source=BI-CS-All):

> Donald Trump's senior advisers have begun presenting coronavirus data to the president in terms of which electorally important states could be most affected by the virus next and where GOP-leaning areas were being significantly affected in order to sway him into taking stronger action on the virus, The Washington Post reports. In recent weeks, top White House advisers have been presenting Trump "With maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among 'our people' in Republican states," according to a senior administration official quoted by the Post. This new messaging seems to have worked, according to advisers, though the president is still placing the blame for the highly contagious disease's spread and the delayed action elsewhere.

`/u/xracrossx` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hz1o1x/trump_needed_to_be_told_republicans_were_getting/):

> Sounds to me like the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
