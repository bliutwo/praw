## Biden to ABC's David Muir on raising taxes: 'No new taxes' for anyone making less than $400,000

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-abcs-david-muir-raising-taxes-taxes-making/story?id=72554803):

> "It's smart to tax businesses that are in fact making excessive amounts of money and paying no taxes," Biden told Muir. "The money was supposed to go to help small businesses. You have one in six small businesses that have already closed. You're finding a situation that over 60% of the money - only 40% of money for small businesses went to small businesses." "There will be no raising taxes" on the "90% of the businesses out there are mom and pop businesses - that employ less than 50 people," Biden responded.

## Comey claims Senate Russia report "blows up" Barr's narrative about FBI probe

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/comey-senate-russia-fbi-barr-e302892d-8181-4f19-be8a-e4814f4f145d.html):

> Former FBI director James Comey argued on Sunday that the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on 2016 Russian interference "Blows up" President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr's claims that the FBI's Russia investigation was unjustified and a "Hoax." The big picture: Barr has tapped veteran prosecutor John Durham to conduct a sweeping investigation into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, which Trump and his allies have long claimed was a political hit job engineered by Comey and other Obama-era officials. Between the lines: The Senate report was also critical of the FBI and its failures to alert the Democratic National Committee of the full threat of the Russian interference effort.

> I'm not sure why more people aren't talking about the work of fiction that Barr put out. He's the fucker that gave Trump the cover he needed. Beyond what the report said thats the fucking scandal.
