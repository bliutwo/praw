## We’re Arizona Republic reporters Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ronald J. Hansen. We produced a podcast about SB 1070, which codified racial profiling in Arizona’s policing 10 years ago and helped make Arizona a presidential battleground today. Ask us anything.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hwl594/were_arizona_republic_reporters_yvonne_wingett/):

> We recently launched "Rediscovering: SB 1070," a podcast that examines how Senate Bill 1070 - AKA the "Show me your papers" law - came to be. Arizona passed SB 1070 in 2010 in response to the federal logjam on immigration. Ten years later, we're taking a look at the forces that led to SB 1070 and its immediate fallout.

Was it a smart move or not a smart move, given the makeup of Arizona's general election electorate?

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/federal-agents-shoot-portland-reporter-hours-after-judge-issues-restraining-order-to-protect-journalists-during-protests/):

> A federal judge in Oregon on Thursday afternoon issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting federal officers deployed in Portland from using physical force against news reporters and legal observers documenting the ongoing protests and riots in that city. Just hours after the ruling, video emerged showing federal troops firing teargas projectiles at - and ultimately hitting - a local journalist with Oregon Public Broadcasting who was recording the ongoing conflict. Simon further explained that federal officers will not be liable for violating the order if journalists are "Incidentally exposed" to crowd-control devices after the federal agents have issued "An otherwise lawful dispersal order."
