> As a civil officer, he can be impeached by the House of Representatives for high crimes. He's certainly committed and assisted a few. Even if the Senate doesn't convict, we still need to uphold the Constitution and its designs to limit tyranny.

## Mike Bloomberg to spend at least $100 million in Florida to benefit Joe Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bloomberg-money-florida-biden/2020/09/12/af51bb50-f511-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html):

> Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to spend at least $100 million in Florida to help elect Democrat Joe Biden, a massive late-stage infusion of cash that could reshape the presidential contest in a costly toss-up state central to President Trump's reelection hopes. Bloomberg made the decision to focus his final election spending on Florida last week, after news reports that Trump had considered spending as much as $100 million of his own money in the final weeks of the campaign, Bloomberg's advisers said. This person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, estimated that it would take $15 million to $20 million to significantly move Biden's numbers among Latinos, and $60 million to $70 million to get on television across the state over the next 51 days and have a real impact.

> >Bloomberg’s aim is to prompt enough early voting that a pro-Biden result would be evident soon after the polls close. Florida, unlike other swing states, reports almost all early ballots shortly after voting ends.

## CNN kicks Trump adviser off air after he refuses to address Woodward revelations

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cnn-jake-tapper-trump-adviser-peter-navarro-kick-woodward-b434297.html):

> CNN host Jake Tapper abruptly ended his interview with economist Peter Navarro on Sunday after the White House adviser repeatedly failed to answer a question about Donald Trump misleading the public about the deadliness of Covid-19 earlier this year. When Mr Tapper asked Mr Navarro to address the audio recording of Mr Trump's private comments to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in February about how "Deadly" the coronavirus pandemic was - even as he was publicly likening it to the common flu - Mr Navarro swerved into a long rundown of the Trump administration's actions on the health crisis. Mr Trump admitted to Mr Woodward in a recorded conversation on 19 March that it was part of his coronavirus strategy to publicly "Play it down" to avoid a "Panic" among the people.

`/u/Tamagene` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/irzggp/cnn_kicks_trump_adviser_off_air_after_he_refuses/):

> “And I would just like to remind the American people watching that the United States has less than 5 per cent of the world's population, and the United States has more than 20 per cent of the world's coronavirus deaths. That is a fact." -Tapper

Trump on a purported antifa sympathizer who allegedly killed someone in Portland being killed by federal forces: "This guy was a violent criminal, and the US Marshals killed him. And I'll tell you something - that's the way it has to be. There has to be retribution." pic.

> Fucking hold up, indicting Steve Bannon for defrauding investors for a phony "Build the Wall" scheme is fucking election interference? Guiliani is a Russian asset. Simple as that.

> The cops and any significant sized openly pro-Trump militias like Patriot Prayer are all on the same side, and I'd go as far as to say there's been some coordination going on, probably more to come.
