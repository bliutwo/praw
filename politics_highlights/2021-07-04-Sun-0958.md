> The defendants were rushing to delete evidence of their crimes caught on video, which sounds even more dopey when you remember that it was the only time in history where it was socially acceptable to wear a mask.

## Letters to the Editor: Will bishops deny Communion to pro-gun politicians? How are they 'pro-life'?

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-04/bishops-may-deny-communion-biden):

> To the editor: The proposal by some U.S. Catholic bishops to deny President Biden Communion is ludicrous. To the editor: In the "Analysis" on the American Catholic bishops considering denying Biden Communion because of his strong support for abortion rights, your reporter writes: "The same bishops largely turned a blind eye to former President Trump's flouting of religious values because they favored his willingness to pursue a conservative social agenda." The same bishops would already deny former President Trump Communion because he's a Protestant and not a Catholic.

`/u/louiseaveryb` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/odi79t/letters_to_the_editor_will_bishops_deny_communion/):

> You don't even have to look that far to find the hypocrisy in what the church is doing. Not long ago, the Pope himself issued a statement that the death penalty is counter to the Church's teachings. In the eyes of the Church, abortion and the death penalty are equally wrong. 
> 
> Yet, the American bishops only seem interested in punishing those who support abortion, but are strangely silent on those who support the death penalty.
> 
> I wonder why?

> Then come up with a federal plan, like beefing up loan forgiveness to 100% and providing yearly cash bonuses paid out in federal tax returns. It has become clear that a number of states are run by people who understand that an educated electorate would ride their asses out on a rail, so they’ll underfund schools and pay starvation wages to teachers.

## St. Louis Newspaper Bashes GOP, Josh Hawley For 'Contempt' Of Democracy | "Plenty of words come to mind to describe ... actions by one of America’s two major political parties," the editorial reads. "'Patriotic' is nowhere among them.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/josh-hawley-capitol-insurrection-democracy-contempt-st-louis_n_60e13699e4b0e01b6b1eeef7):

> In honor of the Fourth of July, a leading Missouri newspaper went after the enemies of American democracy  namely, many Republican lawmakers, led by the state's very own GOP Sen. Josh Hawley. "Americans of all political stripes should be able to agree that elections must be accessible and fair, that the legitimacy of those elections must be respected regardless of outcome - and that violence is never an acceptable response from citizens who don't like a particular election result," noted an editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The contempt for democracy was also exposed in Republicans' failure to "Hold Trump accountable for what was arguably the most impeachable thing any sitting president has ever done," and by GOP lawmakers blocking an investigation into the Jan. 6 violence, the Post-Dispatch editorial pointed out.

## Gender wage gap narrowed to 1% in Biden White House

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/07/02/women-earn-99-cents-every-dollar-earned-men-biden-white-house/7845891002/):

> WASHINGTON - Women working in the White House under President Joe Biden earn 99 cents for every $1 earned by male employees, according to an annual report released by the Executive Office of the President, a gap significantly narrower than under bothprevious administrations and the national average. Nationally, women currently earn an average of 80 cents for every dollar a man earns. The average salary for a woman in the Biden administration is $93,752 and $94,639 for a man, a difference of about 1%, the White House reported.

`/u/HammerStark` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/odib6u/gender_wage_gap_narrowed_to_1_in_biden_white_house/):

> 1% is the mathematical equivalent to full parity. This should be celebrated, not called ‘not enough.’ This is the problem with the modern left’s attitude, nothing is enough, because they don’t understand the concept of compromise, like small children it’s, ‘if it isn’t exactly what we want, it’s not enough.’
