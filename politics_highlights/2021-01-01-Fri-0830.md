## Trickle-down economics is dead. It’s time to tax the rich harder

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/20/trickle-down-economics-is-dead-its-time-to-tax-the-rich-harder):

> It studied fiscal policies in 18 countries over 50 years and concluded that tax cuts for the rich have never trickled down and only really benefit those individuals who are directly affected. He said Britain's highest earners had generated so much extra income, encouraged by the tax benefit, that they had paid £8bn in extra tax to the exchequer. What Osborne failed to say was that tax payments were held back in the year before his policy came into effect and then paid the following year at the lower rate.

## Trump hotel in DC massively hikes prices for Biden inauguration dates

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-hotel-biden-inauguration-price-hike-b1781186.html):

> The hotel recently unblocked the dates after months of keeping 16-20 January 2021 unavailable to bookings, presumably in anticipation of Mr Trump's inauguration. On other days in January, the average room charge for the hotel is priced at $436. Trump International is not the only hotel in Washington to raise prices in hopes of heightened demand around the inauguration. The Trump Organisation announced plans to sell the Washington, DC hotel earlier this year, although a report by the Washington Post quoted sources saying that the plan had been stalled due to a collapse of the market.

> 
> Watch for the Trump idiots to brag about how small Biden’s crowd is.

## Trump Blames Everyone but Himself for His Defeat

Summary of [original article](https://reason.com/2020/12/30/trump-blames-everyone-but-himself-for-his-defeat/):

> Nearly all of the 60 or so post-election lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign, whether they alleged actual voting fraud or were limited to challenging election procedures, have been rejected by state or federal judges, including Trump appointees. After the Court unanimously declined to hear two lawsuits challenging the election results in swing states, Trump said the justices-including the three he picked-"Chickened out," revealing themselves as "Totally incompetent and weak." Trump, who says he actually won by "a magnificent landslide," still claims he has "Absolute PROOF" of "Massive Election Fraud" that for some reason he has failed to produce in court. The only person Trump has not blamed for his defeat is the one who apparently alienated enough voters to secure Biden's victory.

`/u/jp_books` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kobs3c/trump_blames_everyone_but_himself_for_his_defeat/):

> He would have been reelected in a landslide, massaged his massive ego, and made a bajillion dollars legally if he had said "I have the smartest doctors in the world and I will get us through this. I won'tlet the small sacrifices we make scar us. Show your patriotism by wearing a MAGA mask available on my website for only 88 dollars."

## Kelly Loeffler's extensive ties to the energy sector suggest major conflict of interest. Loeffler was named to Georgia Power board of directors two months before she had to leave for the Senate

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/01/01/kelly-loefflers-extensive-ties-to-the-energy-sector-suggest-major-conflict-of-interest/):

> Paul Bowers, company president and CEO, said the board had picked Loeffler not only because of her knowledge about energy markets and European carbon trading markets, in which Georgia Power deals heavily, but her knowledge of cryptocurrency - Loeffler was at the time CEO of Bakkt, the aforementioned joint venture between ICE, Microsoft and Starbucks. "This insight into the global energy market and her unique digital experience will provide an extremely valuable perspective as we evolve as an energy industry and as a business to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and state," Bowers said in a press release at the time. Loeffler does not sit on the Senate Energy Committee, but as mentioned above she sits on the Agriculture Committee, whose oversight includes issues regarding rural energy development.

## Joe Biden to have new Secret Service team amid concern about Trump loyalty

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/31/joe-biden-secret-service-team-trump-loyalty):

> Joe Biden is expected to receive Secret Service protection with a new team that is more familiar to him and replacing some agents amid concerns that they may be politically allied with Donald Trump. Several "Senior" Secret Service agents are poised to return to the president-elect's protection team and Biden knows these agents well because they guarded him and his family during his time as vice-president, according to the article, echoed in a report by CNN, citing a law enforcement source. While former vice-presidents are given a security detail for six months after leaving office, he formally requested Secret Service protection after protesters rushed on to the stage at a campaign rally, CNN said.
