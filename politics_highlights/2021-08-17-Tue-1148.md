## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 33

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p5mpaj/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Land Of Lincoln checking in with 2 bits of news. IL became the first state to require high schools to teach media literacy, aka how to find misinformation, and will most likely be packaged within the already-required computer literacy course. Also, IL schools are now prohibited from issuing rules regarding hairstyles historically associated with race and ethnicity.

## Seditious Presidents Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Run Again, Argues Fox News’ Juan Williams — And the “facts say Trump tried to stage a coup,” declared the Fox News’ analyst.

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/juan-williams-sedition-trump-election_n_611b30f9e4b0648197684f9c):

> American presidents who try to strong-arm democracy to hang onto power should not be allowed to run again, Fox News' liberal-leaning pundit Juan Williams argued Monday in an impassioned attack on Donald Trump. Williams, in a column in The Hill, wrote that he's convinced Trump plans to run again - evidenced by his $100 million war chest. Garland has the "Power to stop Trump from running again," Williams asserted.

> Is there another example in American history where the executive branch launched an attack on the other branches of government? Seems unprecedented and disqualifying.

## Full List of 16 Republicans Who Voted Against Visas for Afghans Who Helped U.S. Troops

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-16-republicans-voted-against-visas-afghans-who-helped-u-s-troops-1620043):

> With the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan and troops deployed to help evacuate U.S. personnel and Afghans who assisted coalition forces, attention has turned on the visa system for those who helped U.S. forces. On July 22, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to provide 8,000 more visas under the SIV program for Afghan interpreters, contractors and other U.S. allies who may be vulnerable as the Taliban seizes the country. Representative Massie told Newsweek on Tuesday: "The program to extend visas to those who helped our military already exists and I support that program. The vote on the new measure was to greatly expand the number of visas and to include categories of people who did not help us in the war, while simultaneously reducing the vetting of these immigrants."

## Lay off Joe Biden: He didn’t “lose” Afghanistan — we are finally leaving it alone. We spent 20 messed-up years in Afghanistan flexing our muscles and money, and now we are making a messy exit

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/08/17/lay-off-joe-biden-he-didnt-lose-afghanistan--we-are-finally-leaving-it-alone/):

> Do you really think our pull-out from Afghanistan would have looked any different under the man who handled the coronavirus pandemic so well that he cashiered 400,000 American lives? He claimed over and over that he was going to end the "Forever wars" and get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan once and for all. Republicans have been waiting to hang "Losing" the Afghanistan war around the neck of Joe Biden since he announced back in April that we would withdraw the troops remaining in that country by the end of this month. We began losing Afghanistan the day we "Took" Kabul from the Taliban and said we had driven al-Qaida terrorists out of the country.

`/u/MLBisMeMatt` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p61pwa/lay_off_joe_biden_he_didnt_lose_afghanistan_we/):

> Hopefully the lesson here is to stop going to war against concepts: wars on terror, drugs, and communism.
> 
> We’re 0/3 when fighting ideals

## Biden argues U.S. troops shouldn't fight in war that 'Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves'

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/afghanistan/1003796/biden-argues-us-troops-shouldnt-fight-in-war-that-afghan-forces-are-not-willing):

> President Biden on Monday defended his Afghanistan exit strategy in a speech, arguing that American troops shouldn't fight and die in a war that the U.S.-trained Afghan military "Is not willing to fight for itself." He was referring to the fact that Afghanistan's security forces appeared to put up little resistence against the Taliban's offensive last week. Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested the Afghan security forces' "Inability" to hold off the insurgents was a primary reason as to why Afghanistan fell so much more quickly than anticipated. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that while the U.S. may have spent a lot of money building up Afghanistan's defense, they could not give the forces "The will" to fight.

> Something we should have been asking ourselves twenty years ago.
