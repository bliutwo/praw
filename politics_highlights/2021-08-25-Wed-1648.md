## DeSantis's Poll Numbers Plummet as Florida Deals With Terrifying COVID Numbers

Summary of [original article](https://truthout.org/articles/desantiss-poll-numbers-plummet-as-florida-deals-with-terrifying-covid-numbers/):

> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is seeing his approval ratings plunge after enacting and seeking to enforce stringent measures that prevent schools in his state from taking actions that would prevent the spread of coronavirus. The dissatisfaction felt by Florida voters has put DeSantis at a disadvantage against his potential political opponents, as he is up for reelection in 2022. In a hypothetical matchup against former governor and current U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, DeSantis would lose the governorship, earning just over 43 percent of the vote versus Crist, who would get close to 57 percent, the poll found.

## Man who plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sentenced to over 6 years in prison

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/man-who-plotted-kidnap-michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer-sentenced-over-n1277582):

> A Michigan man who admitted taking part in an extremist group's plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in retaliation for Covid restrictions was sentenced Wednesday to over six years in prison. U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker sentenced Garbin to 75 months in prison, followed by three years of probation, and a $2,500 fine. Government lawyers said Garbin cooperated extensively with their investigation, providing "a wide-ranging insider's view of the conspiracy," which they said evolved from planning to attack legislators at the State Capitol to rehearsing a plot to kidnap Whitmer from her lakeside summer home last fall.

## Matt Gaetz Failed to Properly Disclose His Abysmal Book Sales

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/matt-gaetz-failed-to-properly-disclose-his-abysmal-book-sales):

> Amid a Justice Department investigation into alleged sex crimes and a related House Ethics probe, beleaguered congressman Rep. Matt Gaetz appears to have committed at least one much smaller but more straightforward federal violation: failure to disclose how much money he made from a book he published last September. The Gaetz spokesperson did not answer follow-ups about the nature of the documents and why Gaetz did not have them when he filed his original disclosure several days ahead of deadline. "It appears Congressman Gaetz has failed to disclose his interests in the book and any income he received from the book as required by federal law," Morgan said after reviewing Gaetz's disclosures.

## Kayleigh McEnany mocked for claiming there was no ‘crisis after crisis’ under Trump: ‘The multiverse is real’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kayleigh-mcenany-trump-biden-crisis-b1908519.html):

> Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has been widely ridiculed after claiming "You didn't see crisis after crisis" when Donald Trump was president. Speaking in an interview with Fox News, for whom Ms McEnany co-hosts the show Outnumbered, the former press secretary suggested that Mr Trump had not stacked up crisis situations like the ones currently seen under President Joe Biden. "Hurricane Maria, Children Caged at the border, Heather Heyer, Charleston, Helsinki, George Floyd, BLM, tear gassed people, fences at WH, north Korea...." another added, while numerous Twitter users said they no longer woke up checking social media to see what new crisis had been started by the president's wild tweeting habit.
