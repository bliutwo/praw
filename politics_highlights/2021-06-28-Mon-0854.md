## Documents show Ivanka Trump didn't testify accurately in inauguration scandal case

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/06/documents-show-ivanka-trump-didnt-testify-accurately-in-inauguration-scandal-case/):

> As Racine put it, the lawsuit maintains "That the Inaugural Committee, a nonprofit corporation, coordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel The Committee also improperly used non-profit funds to throw a private party for the Trump family costing several hundred thousand dollars." In short, the attorney general accused the Trump gang of major grifting, and he is seeking to recover the money paid to the Trump Hotel so those funds can be used for real charitable purposes. "Please take into consideration," she warned, that the PIC's spending would eventually be audited and this deal with the Trump Hotel would "Become public knowledge." Winston Wolkoff is now a lead cooperating witness in Racine's lawsuit against the Trump Organization and the PIC. Mother Jones sent lawyers for Ivanka Trump and the Trump Organization a list of questions about her deposition testimony and its accuracy. In her own deposition in the inauguration scandal case, Winston Wolkoff testified that she was worried "It would look [that] members of the Trump family or the Trump Organization or the Trump Hotel financially profited from the inauguration." During that deposition, she was asked whether it seemed "Improper" to her that Ivanka Trump was "Involved at times in decision-making about some of the events that were part of the inaugural festivities." She replied, "I think it was questionedIt was out of the ordinary."

`/u/bemenaker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o9iu3b/trump_is_a_loser_president_and_his_supporters/):

> Republicans cannot publicly admit that Trump fairly lost. They are using his loss as an excuse to pass all these voter suppression laws. That's their real goal here. This has nothing to do with Trump, and everything to do with stealing power in the future.

## GOP Tries to Drag the Military into the Culture War

Summary of [original article](https://thebulwark.com/gop-tries-to-drag-the-military-into-the-culture-war/):

> In many cases, this would be officers' first encounter with these ideas, since, as Rosa Brooks writes, the military has in recent decades "Become more southern, less urban, and more politically conservative than American society as a whole." The military itself is also institutionally conservative. The U.S. military has done a tremendous job of staying out of divisive, partisan issues, and politicians have largely kept the military out of their partisan fights for decades. Now the GOP is taking the culture war to the military.

`/u/restore_democracy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o9i7ur/gop_tries_to_drag_the_military_into_the_culture/):

> So first the party of “blue lives matter” abandons the Capitol police, and then in spite of the “support our troops” rhetoric they attack the military?
