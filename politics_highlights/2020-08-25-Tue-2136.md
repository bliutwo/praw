## I am the Ashlee Wright from The Satanic Templeâ€™s Religious Reproductive Rights campaign here to answer your questions about TSTâ€™s Satanic abortion ritual. AMA!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/igg7ms/i_am_the_ashlee_wright_from_the_satanic_temples/):

> The Satanic Temple has announced that its Satanic abortion ritual exempts TST members from enduring medically unnecessary and unscientific regulations when seeking to terminate their pregnancy. Because these procedures contravene Satanists' religious convictions, those who perform the religious abortion ritual-which involves the recitation of two of our tenets and a personal affirmation that is ceremoniously intertwined with the abortion-are exempt from these prerequisite procedures and can receive first-trimester abortions on demand. To watch our announcement video and to learn more about the Satanic abortion ritual, its procedure, and specific legal exemptions, visit: https://announcement.

> I see what you're doing here -- using the Supreme Court's expansion of religious "exemptions" from civil rights laws to argue that a similar religious "exemption" from abortion restrictions must exist as well. Basically turning the Court's arguable over-deference to religion against them. From a legal perspective, this should be an interesting case to follow.
> 
> Are you working with any civil rights organizations or anything like that to formulate the legal strategy here?

## Trump Crony, Postmaster General DeJoy, Lies Under Oath to Congress

Summary of [original article](https://peoplesworld.org/article/trump-crony-postmaster-general-dejoy-lies-under-oath-to-congress/):

> U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testifies before a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on slowdowns ahead of the November elections on Capitol Hill, Aug. 24. During a day-long, often contentious House Oversight Committee hearing, it was clear many of the panel's majority Democrats didn't believe him, even though DeJoy testified under oath. As might be expected, DeJoy, a former logistics company CEO, also denied discussing postal service issues with GOP President Donald Trump after becoming Postmaster General.

> The desensitization to it all is part of the nefarious plot. The absolute inundation of negativity with no substantial response short circuits our outrage to the point where we quietly resign ourselves to venting on the internet, our metaphorical "going to the Winchester, having a pint, and waiting for all of this to blow over"
> 
> But it's becoming a bit scary in that it just doesn't seem to be blowing over. The town's overrun with zombies, and resignation and apathy are a road to collective demise.
> 
> So I'm just saying, when you all are down, I'm down. We don't have to sit here and feign shock for every new scandal.

## Biden campaign says China's treatment of Uighur Muslims is "genocide"

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/biden-campaign-china-uighur-genocide-3ad857a7-abfe-4b16-813d-7f074a8a04ba.html?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=1100):

> The Biden campaign said in a statement Tuesday that the Chinese government's oppression of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the northwest region of Xinjiang is "Genocide," and that Joe Biden "Stands against it in the strongest terms." The Trump campaign and Biden campaign have repeatedly clashed over who is "Tougher" than China. "The unspeakable oppression that Uighurs and other ethnic minorities have suffered at the hands of China's authoritarian government is genocide and Joe Biden stands against it in the strongest terms. If the Trump administration does indeed choose to call this out for what it is, as Joe Biden already did, the pressing question is what will Donald Trump do to take action. He must also apologize for condoning this horrifying treatment of Uighurs."
