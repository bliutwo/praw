> Hey yall; thanks for doing this! My question is as follows:
> 
> There's considerable worry that the Trump campaign may manage to install new electors in key states to curtail the results of the election, and allow for a second term. It seems that Pennsylvania, so far, is outright declining to acknowledge that as a possibility, and maintaining the electors will not be changed.
> 
> What level of concern should we operate with surrounding the possibility that the Trump campaign can somehow forego the democratic process and overturn the election results, either in the courts or through their own appointments of faithless electors?

> Honestly fundraising is a necessary evil , but it's time that the Democratic party start putting their cards on the table and state what they want to do for the country. 
> 
> Tell the American public and particularly Georgia voters what you plan to do with the four years if you're given Senate majority and can break the deadlock. 
> 
> Tell them about job creation grants, tell them you want to bring a public option cost reducing medical insurance to market with the ultimate goal of revamping the healthcare system in the country. Tell them you want to dismantle the predatory lending market that targets minority communities. Tell them you want to revamp the education system, from the primary grades to post-secondary opportunities, increase prosperity for all willing to put in the hard work.

> 
> If the Democratic party continues to embrace the centrist bipartisan approach it will be an extreme uphill battle into 22 and 24. If it wasn't for the pandemic and the massive draw towards absentee ballot there may not have been party representation to take this win from Donald Trump.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-speaks-on-fallen-troops-while-trump-rants-about-fox-2020-11):

> Hours after news of the crash broke, Trump was furiously retweeting people criticizing Fox News. In the wake of the crash, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, who replaced Mark Esper after he was fired by the president on Monday, issued a statement on the tragic crash.

The latest MFO statement reports five US troops were killed in the crash.

## Trump-Appointed Judge Throws Out Trump Campaign’s Inadequate Lawsuit Against CNN

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/awkward/trump-appointed-judge-throws-out-trump-campaigns-inadequate-lawsuit-against-cnn/):

> A Donald Trump-appointed federal judge on Thursday dismissed a libel lawsuit filed by the president's re-election campaign, which alleged that CNN intentionally published false statements about the administration's solicitation of election assistance from foreign governments. "The Statement itself contains no such qualifying language-it simply asserts that the Trump campaign assessed potential risks against potential benefits and decided to leave the possibility of help from Russia on the table," the judge said. While Brown dismissed the current complaint, he did give the Trump campaign the opportunity to file an amended complaint that sufficiently alleges the statements were made with actual malice.
