## /r/Politics is looking for more moderators!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pka7da/rpolitics_is_looking_for_more_moderators/):

> Because it can be a challenge to address reports on comments and submissions in addition to everything else we have going on such as AMAs, discussion threads and megathreads, we are looking for new moderators who are willing to help us out. Enforcing the subreddit rules is not about removing opinions you disagree with, and we take impartiality seriously in evaluating and retaining new moderators. While we do recruit moderators who are not regular participants on r/politics, our preference is for users who have interacted here before.

## Abortion Bounty Hunters in Texas Are Not "Whistleblowers"—They're Cruel Vigilantes

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/09/07/abortion-bounty-hunters-texas-are-not-whistleblowers-theyre-cruel-vigilantes):

> One of the many preposterous claims coming from supporters of the vicious new Texas law against abortion is that bounty hunters - standing to gain a $10,000 reward from the state-will somehow be "whistleblowers. " The largest anti-abortion group in Texas is trying to attach the virtuous "whistleblower" label to predators who'll file lawsuits against abortion providers and anyone who "aids or abets" a woman getting an abortion. It's fitting-and revealing-that the professed "whistleblowing" website thrown up by the big Texas Right to Life organization was welcomed by an internet provider that specializes in hosting services for extreme far-right groups.

## Treasury: Top 1 percent responsible for $163 billion in unpaid taxes

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/571316-treasury-top-1-percent-responsible-for-163-billion-in-unpaid-taxes):

> The U.S. loses roughly $163 billion each year in taxes owed and unpaid by the richest Americans, the Treasury Department estimated in a Wednesday blog post defending 's tax plan. In a post calling for stronger enforcement of tax laws, the department calculated that the top 1 percent of Americans by annual income are responsible for roughly 28 percent of all lost tax revenue. The Treasury Department estimated that the gap between paid and owed taxes was about $600 billion in 2019, and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig has suggested that it could be as high as $1 trillion annually.
