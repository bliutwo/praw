Summary of [original article](https://www.fox6now.com/news/health-department-shuts-down-pro-trump-rally-in-milwaukee):

> A violation of the city's public health guidelines amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the health department showed up. "The health department reached out to Serb Hall yesterday to make sure they knew the rules. For political events, the max capacity is 100 people. For a licensed barn restaurant, people must be sitting down and wearing masks." Health officials said two health inspectors were sent to follow up and it appeared "All regulations were being violated." One health inspector was pushed but not injured.

## Michigan judge says GOP election challengers skipped training session, didn't fully understand process

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/949895/michigan-judge-says-gop-election-challengers-skipped-training-session-didnt-fully-understand-process):

> A Michigan judge has shot down an attempt to delay the certification of 2020 election results in Detroit, Michigan, after determining that challengers lacked a "Full understanding" of the process and their claims weren't credible. Kenny said that while the plaintiffs relied "On numerous affidavits from election challengers who paint a picture of sinister fraudulent activities occurring" at the TCF Center in Detroit, the challengers didn't attend a training session on Oct. 29, and as a result, they "Did not have a full understanding of the TCF absent ballot tabulation process," per Bloomberg. A Michigan judge has denied the Trump campaign's motion to cease certification of the vote in Detroit, noting that if the election challengers had attended orientation, they would know that what they were witnessing was routine.

> Of course. All the people at the Million Moron March, Mike Pence, Kayleigh McEnany and of course Donald Trump should know that already. America has become so backwards if they really believe that theyll win even after Biden has proven to have won. Theres no way Trump will get 37 electors on his side, and if he somehow does the blowback will be devastating.

> If they truly want to make America Great Again, then they should rejoin us in reality before things get bad.

## The Best Thing About a Trump Loss Is Stephen Miller Leaving the White House: Just about everyone—conservatives, progressives, libertarians—should be glad to say goodbye to this cruel approach to immigration policy.

Summary of [original article](https://reason.com/2020/11/14/the-best-thing-about-a-trump-loss-is-stephen-miller-leaving-the-white-house/):

> Miller went on to become a special adviser to President Donald Trump and one of the primary tailors of the administration's immigration policies. A farewell to Miller's approach, apparently guided by his disdain for migrants as human beings, is arguably the biggest upside to the end of the Trump administration. Miller is the man who reportedly said he "Would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil." Though Trump promised during his campaign to protect DACA recipients, he weaponized their precarious status for political capital; when the courts declined to strike down.

## ‘Million MAGA March’ Falls 900,000 or So Short of a Full Deck

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/million-maga-march-falls-900000-or-so-short-of-a-full-dec):

> They came to town to collectively demand the disenfranchisement of more than 78 million Americans, Joe Biden voters, and to reaffirm that "Legal votes" can only be cast by white folks outside of miscegenated cities. The disparate groups of demonstrators called the protest by various names, including "Stop the Steal," "March for Trump" and the "Million MAGA March"-the latter of which was cribbed from the 1995 "Million Man March," because these people can't go a day without stealing from Black folks. There were far less than a million people there, though the White House way overinflated the numbers on hand for Trump, just as they did four years ago at this administration's inauguration.

`/u/osaucyone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/juawuy/million_maga_march_falls_900000_or_so_short_of_a/):

> 988,400 actually.
