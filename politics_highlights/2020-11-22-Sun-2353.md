## Trump Yet to Answer One Press Question Since Election As GOP Pressure for His Concession to Biden Grows

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-yet-answer-one-press-question-since-election-gop-pressure-his-concession-biden-grows-1549366):

> Republican pressure for President Donald Trump to concede to President-elect Joe Biden grew this weekend as he continued his unprecedented run of staying silent with the press. Since most major media outlets called the election for Biden 15 days ago, Trump has tweeted claims of widespread voter fraud and a stolen election on nearly a daily basis. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan urged Trump to concede instead of golfing after Trump called him a RINO on Twitter Sunday.

## Trump dumps Sydney Powell, lawyer who promised to "blow up" Georgia, as legal strategy unravels

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-dumps-sydney-powell-lawyer-who-promised-blow-georgia-legal-strategy-unravels-1549369):

> President Donald Trump's legal team distanced themselves from Sidney Powell, a lawyer who threatened to "Blow up" Georgia, as the campaign's post-election lawsuits suffered further defeat over the weekend. "Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own. She is not a member of the Trump Legal Team. She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity," Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a joint Sunday statement. Powell has appeared with Giuliani and members of the campaign's legal team at several press events over the past month, including one last Thursday.

Summary of [original article](https://www.startribune.com/native-americans-showed-up-to-vote-and-had-an-impact/573156711/):

> A similar pattern played out in precincts on or around Native American reservations across northern Minnesota - blips of deep blue in the middle of red Trump country. In other battleground states, Native American voters turned out in record numbers, including Arizona, where Biden leads Trump by 11,000 votes. There were bright spots for Native candidates: a record-breaking six Native American and Native Hawaiian candidates were elected to Congress this cycle.

Today they decided to retroactively cut ties.

> Edit2: for anyone still confused, Newsmax is even further right than Fox News and it’s one of the two networks the trump faithful have been migrating to lately since they believe Fox News is now too liberal (no I am not joking)
