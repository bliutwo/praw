Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/cnn-trump-speech-jim-acosta-b1765693.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1607006766):

> Donald Trump delivered a surprise speech on Wednesday that reporters and American networks condemned, and some would not show audiences, because it included baseless attacks on the election process. CNN news anchor Erin Burnett also declined to show Mr Trump's speech because to do so would "Amplify things that are factually untrue, and the president knows to be factually untrue," she said. Mr Trump, who has denied the election result, alleged votes were "Stolen", and failed to overturn results through the courts, had labelled the speech as "Maybe the most important speech I've ever made".

> I mean why would you bother to air that shit? It was a 46 minute lie filled disinformation campaign. It's total horseshit, very suitable for facebook and fox news.

> Mary Trump: POTUS gaslighting himself into thinking he won election - Business Insider Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'. It indicates a way to close an interaction, or dismiss a notification. President Donald Trump's estranged niece, Mary, says her uncle hasn't conceded the 2020 presidential election because he truly believes he won. Mary Trump, a Democrat and the daughter of Trump's older brother, Fred Trump Jr., has been speaking out against her uncle since she published a book about him this summer called "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man.".

## Sanders Slams McConnell for Pushing '3-Martini Lunch' Deduction and Zero Relief for 26 Million Hungry Americans

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/03/sanders-slams-mcconnell-pushing-3-martini-lunch-deduction-and-zero-relief-26-million):

> Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for pushing a coronavirus relief measure that contains a 100% tax deduction for business meals-a gift to corporate executives-but nothing for the tens of millions of people across the U.S. who are struggling to afford food for themselves and their families. "Mitch McConnell's 'new' Covid relief bill gives CEOs a 100% tax deduction for a 3-martini lunch, but ZERO to the 26 million who don't have enough food to eat," the Vermont senator tweeted. Unlike McConnell's plan, the bipartisan proposal would provide a $300-per-week federal boost to unemployment insurance, a key lifeline that 12 million Americans are set to lose on December 26 without congressional action.

The Republicans l-o-v-e corporate socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the rest. Ain't gonna happen."

> On Tuesday, as Common Dreams reported, the Kentucky Republican began circulating a purportedly "targeted" coronavirus stimulus proposal that would grant corporations sweeping immunity from coronavirus related lawsuits without providing a federal boost to unemployment benefits, another round of direct payments, or any aid to state and local governments.

## Trump campaign’s star witness in Michigan was deemed ‘not credible.’ Then, her loud testimony went viral.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/03/melissa-carone-michigan-trump-giuliani-election/):

> Weeks after Melissa Carone was tapped by the Trump campaign as a star witness in Michigan, little appeared to be going as planned with the contract IT worker's testimony - an unverified series of claims about ballot fraud at Detroit's vote-counting center. For many following along, the viral clips of Carone appear to sum up the last-ditch legal efforts by the Trump campaign to challenge the vote in swing states won by President-elect Joe Biden. A contractor for Dominion Voting Systems, which supplies voting technology for election jurisdictions nationwide, Carone stumbled into the national spotlight last month as one of a handful of "Extraordinary witnesses" cited by Giuliani to support the Trump campaign's unverified claims of a "Stolen election."

> I saw this woman the day before yesterday and thought she was so fucking insane that I downloaded the whole stream and cut out her part. I love how she makes herself out to be an IT expert on these machines, but it turns out she's a temp worker with some IT experience and got a 1 hour training the day before that she admits was inadequate. Also has a very interesting interaction with the "Dominion Cofounder" who clearly thinks she's a nut case, but she's oblivious to it.  Wild ride, start to finish.

## Trump Promises To Defund The Entire Military, If Congress Won't Let Him Punish The Internet For Being Mean To Him

Summary of [original article](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201201/23254145806/trump-promises-to-defund-entire-military-if-congress-wont-let-him-punish-internet-being-mean-to-him.shtml):

> Of course, even later last night, things took an even stupider turn, as Trump declared on Twitter that unless the NDAA included a full repeal of Section 230, he would veto it. In court, Trump argued that Section 230 "Should be given an 'expansive' reading" in order to protect himself from defamation claims. As for the claim that Section 230 is a "Threat to our National Security," let's play a little thought exercise: which is a bigger threat to our national security: a law that says internet websites are not liable for the actions of their users or defunding the entire military? I'll give you a minute to think about it.

## Florida attorney reportedly under investigation after telling Republicans to change 'your address for the next 2 months' for Georgia runoffs

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/953052/florida-attorney-reportedly-under-investigation-after-telling-republicans-change-address-next-2-months-georgia-runoffs):

> A Florida attorney is reportedly under investigation after trying to register to vote in Georgia ahead of the January runoff election and encouraging other Republicans to change "Your address for the next two months" so they can vote in the state as well, WSB-TV reports. Price reportedly says in the video he's "Moving to my brother's house in Hiram, Georgia and I'm registering to vote." Then, he reportedly tells the Florida Republicans his brother's name and his address, and when a woman asks if they "Can truly register at that address," he reportedly responds, "Sure.". Price told WSB-TV these were just "Humorous comments" and that he "Did not change my voter registration." But according to the report, he did register to vote using his brother's Georgia address the day after he made the remarks, and he's now under investigation.
