## Report: Trump is Terrified About Going to Prison After Losing The Election, As He Should Be

Summary of [original article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/11/donald-trump-post-white-house-prosecutions?utm_source=twitter&mbid=social_twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_social-type=owned&utm_brand=vf):

> Attempting to quash a subpoena from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which had requested eight years of tax returns to determine if the Trump Organization has falsified business records relating to payouts made to a porn star and a Playboy model, the president's attorneys insisted that such a request was unconstitutional because the founding fathers believed sitting presidents should not be subject to the criminal process, which would "Distract the president" from his duties. Pressed by a judge on this argument, and the hypothetical Trump busted out during the 2016 election-that he could "Stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody" and not "Lose any voters"-attorney William Consovoy insisted that yes, that kind of thing would fall under this concept of "Presidential immunity," i.e. Trump could put a bullet in a random pedestrian and avoid prosecution until moving out of the White House. The Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said of Trump, "If he loses, you have a situation that's not dissimilar to that of Nixon when he resigned. Nixon spoke of the cell door clanging shut." Trump has famously survived one impeachment, two divorces, six bankruptcies, twenty-six accusations of sexual misconduct, and an estimated four thousand lawsuits.

## Letterman Says A Trump Loss Would Be 'A Relief To Every Living Being In This Country'

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5fa0406ac5b6501b4ba6b708?ncid=APPLENEWS00001):

> David Letterman thinks President Donald Trump is going to lose reelection bigly. I believe he will lose it big, and it will be a relief to every living being in this country, whether they realize it now or not. Letterman previously reflected on Trump's many appearances on "The Late Show" while he was host, telling The Hollywood Reporter's "Awards Chatter" podcast, "I think he just liked being on TV - had no sense that he was the soulless bastard that he's turned into."
