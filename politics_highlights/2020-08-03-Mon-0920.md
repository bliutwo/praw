## Trump promised a health-care plan in two weeks. It’s been two weeks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/03/trump-promised-health-care-plan-two-weeks-its-been-two-weeks/):

> Here's what didn't happen on Sunday: The signing of a "Full and complete" health-care plan, which Trump had promised in an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace that had aired July 19.Wallace, as good an interviewer as there is, had tweaked Trump over the fact that he had yet to deliver on one of his signature campaign promises, which was to replace the Affordable Care Act with "Something terrific." In his mid-July interview with Wallace, Trump was unabashed: "We're signing a health-care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health-care plan." The truth is, when Trump is stumped, he likes to throw out promises of big policy initiatives - his infrastructure push, for instance - that always seem to be just two weeks away.

## Biden increases Texas staff and resources in bid to win Lone Star state

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-increases-texas-staff-resources/):

> On Monday the Biden campaign announced a slate of staff hires aimed at flipping the historically conservative Lone Star State, last won by a Democratic presidential candidate in 1976 by Jimmy Carter. "Joe Biden is also going to win Texas in the general election for three reasons," Texas Congressman Filemon Vela, an early Biden endorser, told CBS News, "First, Donald Trump and Governor Abbott have made tactical decisions in their COVID response that is now killing Texans en masse. Second, Biden will defeat Trump in the Texas suburbs. Finally, from a historical perspective, Biden will outperform past Democratic candidates in the rural counties." The Biden campaign official also said what separates its approach to Texas from previous Democratic presidential campaigns is the organizing resources will be directed at turning out Texas voters and not using in-state organizers to contact voters in other battleground states.

`/u/Douche_Kayak` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2vfvn/biden_increases_texas_staff_and_resources_in_bid/):

> Trump has already effectively dropped out of Michigan and his polling numbers there pretty much reflect the rest of the rust belt. If trump loses Texas, there's no coming back from it. He could win every currently undecided state and still lose by around 100 electoral votes.

## Trump will use emergency powers to remain in White House if he loses election, says House majority whip

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-2020-election-lose-emergency-powers-biden-polls-a9651041.html):

> Donald Trump could use emergency powers to extend his term in the White House, a senior Democrat has said, as fears grow that the president may attempt to hold onto office should he lose November's election. Last week, Mr Trump floated the idea of delaying the upcoming election amid the coronavirus crisis, suggesting that the vote should be postponed "Until people can properly, securely and safely vote???". "We're going to hold an election on 3 November and the president is going to win," Mr Trump's White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CBS on Sunday.

`/u/qglrfcay` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/i2uzgv/trump_will_use_emergency_powers_to_remain_in/):

> There are no such emergency powers in the Constitution. This was Germany's mistake. We don't have that here. The transfer of power may not be gracious, but it will occur.
