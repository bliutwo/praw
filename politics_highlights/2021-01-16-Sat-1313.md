> We have always had a link in our sidebar where users can apply to be a moderator, but the truth is we don't get many applications at all, so we have decided to reach out to users on a larger scale. Who are we looking for? We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes.

## Misinformation dropped dramatically the week after Twitter banned Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/16/misinformation-trump-twitter/):

> Online misinformation about election fraud plunged 73 percent after several social media sites suspended President Trump and key allies last week, research firm Zignal Labs has found, underscoring the power of tech companies to limit the falsehoods poisoning public debate when they act aggressively. The new research by the San Francisco-based analytics firm reported that conversations about election fraud dropped from 2.5 million mentions to 688,000 mentions across several social media sites in the week after Trump was banned from Twitter. Zignal found it dropped swiftly and steeply on Twitter and other platforms in the days after the Twitter ban took hold on Jan. 8.The president and his supporters also have lost accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Spotify, Shopify and others.

> I don't think he is going to resign and I don't think he is going to be expelled and I don't think he is going to eventually lose re-election. However, I also don't think this issue is going to go away. I hope at the very least that it will prevent him from ever obtaining higher office.

## Manchin: Removing Hawley, Cruz with 14th Amendment 'should be a consideration'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/534565-manchin-removing-hawley-cruz-with-14th-amendment-should-be-a-consideration):

> Via the 14th Amendment over their objections last week to the Electoral College results. Speaking to PBS's "Firing Line" on Friday night, Manchin said the Senate should explore the option after a violent mob, riled up by and convinced by Republicans such as Hawley and Cruz that the election was fraudulent, ransacked the Capitol in one of the darkest points in American democracy. Critics of Hawley and Cruz, who led the effort in the Senate to object to the presidential election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, said the amendment applies to the two senators, whom they blame for inciting the riot with their rhetoric echoing concerns of election fraud and irregularities.

> EDIT: yes I know Boebert isnâ€™t in the senate. But nonetheless anyone and everyone who participated in the insurrection whether via in person or through conspiring with others should be arrested and sent to trial.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-joe-manchin-says-senate-should-consider-using-14th-amendment-to-remove-josh-hawley-and-ted-cruz):

Manchin, a moderate, recalled that while the Capitol building was under siege on Jan. 6 and Senators waited in a secure location before returning to the upper chamber to continue their votes, he tried to persuade Hawley not to continue contesting the election results.
