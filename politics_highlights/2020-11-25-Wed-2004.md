## Trump suddenly irrelevant, Biden steals Thanksgiving spotlight with call for unity

Summary of [original article](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/25/trump-suddenly-irrelevant-biden-steals-thanksgiving-spotlight-with-call-for-unity/):

> While Trump continued his fruitless legal challenges, Biden spent Thanksgiving Eve giving an optimistic address to the nation which was meant to show stark differences from the past four years. You can hardly blame Trump for being angry about the different treatment Biden is getting compared to him four years ago. Trump can no longer count on the networks to go live with his speeches and it must be frustrating for him to watch Biden morph into the president before the former vice president has even been inaugurated.

## Sen. Perdue Insisted He Had No Input At All On Stock Buys. New Evidence Shows He Did.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sen-david-perdue-insisted-he-had-no-input-at-all-on-stock-buys-new-evidence-shows-he-did?source=politics&via=rss):

> Earlier this year, Sen. David Perdue personally directed his wealth adviser to sell off $1 million worth of stock in a financial company before its share price cratered, The New York Times reported on Wednesday-a finding that flies in the face of Perdue's repeated insistence that he has no input whatsoever over his considerable investment portfolio. In response to The Daily Beast's reporting about separate stock trades, for example, a Perdue spokesperson said Perdue "Doesn't manage his trades, they are handled by outside financial advisers without his prior input or approval No amount of lies from liberal media outlets or Democratic political groups will change that fact." On Wednesday, the Times reported that Perdue was investigated by the Department of Justice as it probed possible insider trading from a number of lawmakers over their investment activity around the coronavirus spread. That investigation found that an executive at an Atlanta-based company called Cardlytics, where Perdue had previously served on the board, mistakenly sent Perdue a vague email in January saying changes were coming to the company.

## In an apparent dig at the Trump administration, Obama says Biden's foreign policy team will 'know where countries are'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-colbert-biden-harris-presidency-map-foreign-policy-trump-2020-11):

> During an interview with the "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert that aired on Tuesday, Obama praised Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for the work that they've done so far to build their new administration. Obama added: "And have experience and written about stuff and know where countries are. It's great." The former president was likely referencing President Donald Trump's geographic blunders, where he reportedly mispronounced Nepal and Bhutan as "Nipple" and "Button" during a June 2017 intelligence meeting and knew little about the respective countries while studying a world map, according to Politico.

> 
> Or the time he got a call from South Korea and thought it was North Korea. “It was headed for disaster and now we’re talking,” he said. “They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago; they said, ‘We would like to talk.’ And I said, ‘So would we, but you have to denuke.'”

## Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann says Trump should be investigated and charged with potential federal crimes after leaving office

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mueller-prosecutor-andrew-weissmann-trump-should-be-investigated-charged-2020-11):

> The special counsel Robert Mueller's top lieutenant in the Russia investigation said this week that President Donald Trump should be investigated and potentially prosecuted for criminal conduct after he leaves office in January. "We saw Mr. Trump use his clemency power to do just that with, for example, his ally Roger Stone. He commuted Mr. Stone's sentence, who was duly convicted by a jury but never spent a day in jail for crimes that a federal judge found were committed for the president," Weissmann wrote. In his book, "Where Law Ends: Inside the Mueller Investigation," and in interviews, Weissmann said Mueller let the public down by not indicting Trump.
