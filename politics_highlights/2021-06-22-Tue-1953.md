## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 25

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o4ytiq/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Texas. Permitless carry law signed, Abbott announces $250M funding for border wall, and says that the Texas power grid is in tiptop shape. Yet Texans were asked to cut back on power usage because the grid is being overloaded by temperatures that didn't even hit 100.

## House Democrat Suggests Stripping Catholic Church Of Tax-Exempt Status If Biden Denied Communion

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailywire.com/news/house-democrat-suggests-stripping-catholic-church-of-tax-exempt-status-if-biden-denied-communion):

> Rep. Jared Huffman accused the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops of politically weaponizing religion by voting to draft a document that could result in a rebuke of pro-abortion Catholic politicians and suggested punishing them by stripping the Catholic Church of its tax-exempt status. The USCCB on Friday overwhelmingly voted in favor of drafting a document that could lead to a rebuke of publicly pro-abortion Catholic politicians such as President Joe Biden. "We believe the separation of church and state allows for our faith to inform our public duties and best serve our constituents. The Sacrament of Holy Communion is central to the life of practicing Catholics, and the weaponization of the Eucharist to Democratic lawmakers for their support of a woman's safe and legal access to abortion is contradictory," the statement adds.

> If Churches want to persuade their people how to vote, they are involved in politics. Strip the tax exemption for them all now!

## Republicans defeat critical voting rights bill as White House warns ‘democracy is in peril’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/for-the-people-act-senate-vote-b1870954.html):

> A civil rights bill central to expanding voting rights across the US - and Democrats' best chance of an antidote against a wave of restrictive voting laws proposed in nearly every state - has failed in Congress. As expected, Senate Republicans universally rejected a procedural move to begin debate on the For The People Act, effectively killing the bill, and galvanising Democrats, the White House and voting rights advocates around a nationwide campaign to combat voter suppression. After criticism from voting rights advocates and progressives demanding that the president do more to protect ballot access and reject GOP obstruction, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday that the president will "Engage with voting rights groups" and state legislatures that support expanding voting rights, and "Continue to fight to get legislation across the finish line on the federal level."

## Watchdog Group Sues FEC For Dropping Trump Campaign Investigation. “We should not have to sue the FEC repeatedly to make it do its job,” said a director of Campaign Legal Center Action.

Summary of [original article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lawsuit-trump-campaign-violations-fec_n_60d13245e4b0903140638bdd):

> A watchdog group has sued the Federal Election Commission for refusing to launch an investigation of a complaint accusing Donald Trump's presidential campaign of illegally coordinating with a super PAC during the 2020 election. The suit is calling on the court to order the FEC to determine whether the Trump campaign violated campaign finance law. The groups filed a complaint in May 2019 accusing the Trump campaign of issuing a blanket endorsement of all contributions to the super PAC America First Action, throwing open the door for illegal unlimited corporate funds to be fed from the super PAC directly to the campaign and its candidate.

> The attitude of "he's gone, no need to hold him accountable" is exactly what happened with Hitler, who regrouped and came back to completely destroy Germany and put the world into turmoil for 15 years.

## Republican official in Ohio faces charge for voting twice in November election

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/republican-official-ohio-faces-charge-voting-twice-november-election-n1271985):

> Republican lawmakers in Ohio pushing for more "Safety and security" at the ballot box can now point to a clear example of voter fraud in the November 2020 presidential election. Edward Snodgrass, who is a Porter Township trustee, has admitted to forging his dead father's signature on an absentee ballot and then voting again as himself, court records and other sources revealed. Donald Trump, who has refused to concede that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden and continues to push the lie that there was widespread voter fraud even though there is zero evidence to back that claim up, actually won the state of Ohio in November.

`/u/ScotTheDuck` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o5xuo3/republican_official_in_ohio_faces_charge_for/):

> >Snodgrass was busted after a Delaware County election worker questioned the signature on his father’s ballot. A subsequent investigation revealed the ballot had been mailed to H. Edward Snodgrass on Oct. 6 — a day after the 78-year-old retired businessman died.
> 
> "Oh my god.  The dead have risen, and are voting Republican!"
