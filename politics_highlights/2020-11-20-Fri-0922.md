## Kelly Loeffler's disclosures appear to omit the holding company that operates her private jet | If the Georgia senator knowingly falsified or omitted information from her disclosure forms, that's a crime

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/20/kelly-loefflers-disclosures-appear-to-omit-the-holding-company-that-operates-her-private-jet/):

> Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., the unelected multimillionaire senator now heading for a runoff election in January, appears to have omitted a holding company from her federally mandated financial disclosures, which would violate Senate ethics rules and federal law. The company, Descante Capital Holdings, was uncovered in Salon's reporting on a private jet that Loeffler jointly purchased with her husband, Jerry Sprecher, who is chair of the New York Stock Exchange. Her disclosures also list a company called Descante Capital LLC, with a description of "Family office," whose purpose, according to Loeffler's personal comment, is "Administrative and organizational services." Her comment, unlike the other two, does not specify a holding company.

> A senator with a private jet says enough.

## Florida’s Rick Scott tests positive for coronavrius

Summary of [original article](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2020/11/20/floridas-rick-scott-tests-positive-for-coronavrius/?outputType=amp&__twitter_impression=true):

> U.S. Sen. Rick Scott has tested positive for coronavirus and is experiencing "Very mild symptoms," the Florida Republican announced Friday morning. Throughout the pandemic, Scott has opposed mandatory mask mandates, telling Fox News in June that governments should "Stop telling us what to do." But Scott has been more vocal than other Republicans in encouraging people to follow public health guidance and he is often spotted in public wearing a mask. Scott is the ninth U.S. Senator to test positive for COVID-19 or for antibodies and he is the most notable Florida politician to become afflicted with a virus that is rapidly spreading around the country.

> OH NO!

## Lindsey Graham’s Alleged Attempt to Toss Georgia Ballots Is Felony Election Fraud

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/lindsey-graham-brad-raffensperger-georgia-election-fraud.html):

> So far the only individual credibly accused of a fraudulent effort to steal the election is South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. The first bars "Attempts to interfere with" an election official's "Performance of any act or duty." By allegedly asking Raffensperger to falsify the vote count, Graham plainly sought to interfere with the secretary of state's truthful certification of the election. Solicitation of election fraud in the first degree-which Graham allegedly committed by asking Raffensperger to falsify the vote count-is a felony.

`/u/UnderwhelmingAF` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jxqsmg/lindsey_grahams_alleged_attempt_to_toss_georgia/):

> I hope Joe appoints a real bulldog as his AG to deal with some of these criminals. I was actually hoping he’d go another way with his running mate and make Kamala his AG, I think she would have been great in that role.

## David Perdue Hit With More Allegations of Shady Stock Transactions

Summary of [original article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/perdue-hit-with-more-allegations-of-shady-stock-transactions.html):

> Questions were raised earlier this year about Perdue, and also his junior colleague Kelly Loeffler, for individual stock transactions in companies that might have gotten a boost from the COVID-19 crisis - transactions they suspiciously made around the time of a top-secret briefing on the pandemic they received as senators. Perdue, who is just regular rich, did a lot of buying and selling off stock during that fraught period, with two items drawing scrutiny, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted: "Perdue invested up to $245,000 in Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, during multiple transactions around the same time that members of Congress began sounding the alarm that more should be done to address the spread of the virus. Perdue also sold up to $165,000 in stocks for Caesar Entertainment, the casino company whose facilities have shuttered to help combat the spread of the virus." Of the more than 400 companies in which he's bought and sold stock since taking office in 2015, he's reported more transactions involving First Data-a major card payment processor with a significant business in prepaid cards-than any other company but one.
