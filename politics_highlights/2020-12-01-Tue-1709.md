> Come on Schumer.  I want to see a Democrat on tv explaining why Americans aren't getting any stimulus help from the government due to the self proclaimed Grim Reaper Mitch McConnell.  Furthermore, if he wants that nickname I say give it to him and tie the 250,000 dead and countless struggling American families to him and his fellow Republicans.
> 
> Heck, since the Georgia special election is coming up.  I want to see Democrats reminding Trump voters they got used by Republicans along with their President.  They used Trump and his supporters to get a Federalist judge rammed through to the Supreme Court but sat on their hands on a stimulus even the President supported.

## A witness in Trump ally Sidney Powell's lawsuits says the voting results in 'Edison County' indicate fraud. No such place exists.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/sidney-powell-election-lawsuit-witness-vote-problems-edison-county-2020-12):

> A witness in a lawsuit from allies of President Donald Trump trying to overturn democracy in Michigan said that the vote count in Edison County "Are cause for concern and indicate fraud" because President-elect Joe Biden won "More than 100% of the votes." The typo-peppered lawsuit makes many of the same wildly conspiratorial arguments Powell made at a press conference that led to her ouster from Trump's legal team: That the now-dead Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez used voting machines to manipulate election results in his own country, and the very same machines are now being used to manipulate 2020 election results. It's not clear if Keshavarz-Nia had another county in mind when referring to a vote count of more than 100% in "Edison County," but some internet sleuths have made claims about more than 100% of particular counties voting by relying on outdated voter record information or simply using the wrong datasets, USA Today and Reuters have reported.
