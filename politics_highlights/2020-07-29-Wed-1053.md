## We're from the Fair Elections Center, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and Campus Vote Project, here to discuss the critical need for Americans to serve as poll workers this year. Ask us anything about how to get involved and the impact your service can have on supporting our democracy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzhw6c/were_from_the_fair_elections_center_the_us/):

> Fair Elections Center developed WorkElections.com, a website that compiles poll worker requirements and application links for thousands of jurisdictions in states across the country. The current pandemic has dramatically reduced the traditional pool of poll workers - many of whom are older - and created an urgent need for recruiting a new workforce to ensure adequate staffing at the polls this fall. A shortage of poll workers could mean closure of polling places and longer lines to vote.

> Is there any contingency plan if federal agents/DHS troops are physically barring citizens from voting?

> So everyone's tax dollars fund the police, but they can refuse service to people based on political speech? That doesn't seem constitutional to me.

## Kavanaugh Urged Supreme Court Justices to Sit Out Trump Tax Returns Case, Report Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kavanaugh-urged-supreme-court-justices-to-sit-out-trump-tax-returns-case-report-says?ref=home):

> Justice Brett Kavanaugh reportedly tried to persuade his colleagues not to rule either way in its high-profile case on President Trump's tax returns. An in-depth report from CNN published Wednesday states that Kavanaugh sent a series of private memos to his fellow justices in an attempt to dissuade them from ruling on whether the president should be compelled to give his financial records to House investigators. He reportedly argued that courts shouldn't get involved in political questions, but his strategy could have left Trump with no legal route to stop his banks from handing over his tax returns to Congress.

## Trump never raised Russia's Taliban bounties with Putin

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/trump-russia-bounties-taliban-putin-call-4a0f6110-ab58-41c0-96fc-57b507462af1.html):

> President Trump has never confronted Vladimir Putin with intelligence indicating Russia paid the Taliban to kill U.S. troops, he told "Axios on HBO" in an interview on Tuesday. Trump has spoken to Putin at least eight times since intelligence about the alleged Russian bounties was reportedly included in the President's Daily Brief - his written intelligence briefing - in late February. Trump told "Axios on HBO" that he was not aware of Nicholson's comments, and said evidence that Russia was aiding the Taliban "Never reached my desk."

`/u/srbesq61` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hzy1ld/trump_never_raised_russias_taliban_bounties_with/):

> We punish China for stealing trade secrets but say nothing to Russia for putting hits on our Servicemen.  If this isn't proof Putin has compromised our government,  nothing is.

> >The former head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan has said clearly and on the record that Russia does indeed smuggle weapons across the Tajik border to the Taliban. Asked about whether he believes that is the case, Trump said: “Well, we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too. The Taliban, in Afghanistan... I’m just saying, we did that too.”
> 
> So this is something his supporters can defend? Defending the actions of an enemy for supplying weapons to another enemy that is engaged in combat with American troops.
> 
> There are no words.

## Outcry in New York after police force protester into unmarked van

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/29/outcry-in-new-york-after-police-force-protester-into-unmarked-van):

> Police officers in New York have been filmed arresting a female protester by forcing her into an unmarked minivan in east Manhattan. In a statement, the New York Police Department said that the woman, "Was wanted for damaging police cameras during 5 separate criminal incidents in & around City Hall Park. The arresting officers were assaulted with rocks & bottles," adding that unmarked police vehicles were used to "Effectively locate wanted suspects." The New York Times reported that, "Several city officials said on Tuesday that they were troubled by the videos of the woman's arrest," quoting New York City comptroller Scott M. Stringer as saying he was "Deeply concerned".

> 
> This is, as should be expected, a severely poor characterization of what was going on down at city hall. You can question the occupation itself, like should people have even been allowed to be there in the way that they were. But beyond that *every* rare instance of violence began with the police. I saw zero instances of an officer or officers minding their own business and being attacked. 
> 
> As to her "resisting" arrest, yes I would expect that when men in riot gear drag you into an unmarked van like they're the fucking mob you would be a little resistant. 
> 
> I hope we can fight to keep these thugs out of New York but I have no faith in our leadership right now.
