## Biden not getting intelligence reports because Trump officials won't recognize him as president-elect

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-not-getting-intelligence-reports-because-trump-officials-won-t-n1247294):

> WASHINGTON -The Trump administration's unwillingness to acknowledge that former Vice President Joe Biden is projected to have won the election has led to an unusual restriction on the flow of national security information to the president-elect. More than three days after media outlets projected that Biden had defeated President Donald Trump to win the White House, GSA chief Emily Murphy had yet to sign the letter of "Ascertainment" - a previously mostly noncontroversial process since the passage of the transition act nearly 60 years ago. Biden received intelligence briefings as a presidential candidate, but they were not at the level of the PDB. And it's not clear that they are continuing now that the election is over.

> 9/11 report made clear that this type of delay in getting classified briefings helped exacerbate the intel fuckup there.

> GOPers hate America.
