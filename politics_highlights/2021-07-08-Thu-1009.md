> Why have reporters been so shy to draw parallels with Russian use of media and the GOP use of social media?  In particular, what https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4&t=870s Peter Pomerantsev "Nothing is True and Everything is Possible" said in 2014...

## GOP women's group shuns "carnival barkers" Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/gop-womens-group-shuns-carnival-barkers-marjorie-taylor-greene-lauren-boebert-1607713?amp=1&__twitter_impression=true):

> Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, calling them "Carnival barkers" and "Shameless self-promoters." The Value In Electing Women Political Action Committee has lent its support to every Republican woman currently serving in the United States Congress and Senate, with a notable deviation in the cases of Greene from Georgia and Boebert from Colorado. A record number of Republican women were elected to Congress in 2020, and Conway said she intends to support that trend however she can with her PAC. She said she wanted to help reelect "All of the GOP women who deserve to be" and get more worthy candidates into the House and Senate.

> I wish the media could learn to shun them, instead of using them for nonsense headlines every time one of them says something moronic, which seems to be their only skill.

> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday mocked former President Donald Trump, referring to him as a "Twice-impeached Florida retiree." "Twice-impeached Florida retiree - and de facto leader of the Republican Party - Donald Trump," Pelosi's office said in a statement. The House of Representatives in January voted to impeach Trump over his role in the Capitol insurrection, making him the first president in US history to be impeached twice.

## Right-Wing Groups Mobilize Against Effort to Crack Down on Tax Dodging by the Rich | "You can't raise taxes, you can't raise taxes that have just been lowered, and you can't enforce existing tax laws—a never-ending race to the revenue bottom," said one critic of the right-wing campaign.

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/07/08/right-wing-groups-mobilize-against-effort-crack-down-tax-dodging-rich):

> Right-wing political advocacy organizations bankrolled by wealthy Americans and large corporations are reportedly mobilizing against a bipartisan agreement to boost IRS funding by $40 billion, money that would go toward cracking down on rich tax cheats who have benefited from the Republican Party's gutting of the agency in recent years. Last month, McConnell blamed "Somebody at the IRS" for leaking the tax returns of some of the wealthiest people in the U.S. to the investigative outlet ProPublica, which used the documents to publish a series of stories detailing pervasive tax dodging by the rich. Well-heeled conservative organizations have long opposed any effort to remedy the harms caused by Republican-led budget cuts at the IRS. In May, Politico reported that right-wing groups "Launched a campaign of TV ads, social media messages, and emails to supporters criticizing proposal to hire nearly 87,000 new IRS workers over the next decade to collect money from tax cheats."

> Obviously they’re trying to get out of paying taxes.

## Republicans want "18 more months of chaos" — followed by the end of democracy

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/07/08/republicans-want-18-more-months-of-chaos--followed-by-the-end-of-democracy/):

> To work with Republicans is to legitimize them as responsible partners in government, when in reality today's Republican Party is an extremist, anti-democratic and white supremacist criminal organization. Newly leaked video footage of a recent event hosted by the right-wing group Patriot Voices shows Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas openly admitting that his party wants "18 more months of chaos and the inability to get stuff done" as President Joe Biden, a bipartisan group of senators, and congressional Democrats work to pass climate and infrastructure legislation. In an interview last year with Yale News, political scientist Jacob Hacker explored how Republicans have built an implausible coalition rooted in "Plutocratic populism," combining "Organized money and organized outrage to win elections, tilt the playing field in their favor, and govern for the top 1%." In order to draw voters to support economic polices that were beloved by "Big donors and big corporations but unpopular among voters, and even many Republicans," the party created an "Infrastructure of outrage," notably the NRA, the Christian right and the right-wing propaganda media.

`/u/GregWilson23` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/og87zu/republicans_want_18_more_months_of_chaos_followed/):

> So the real fascists are showing who the really are. I’ve been seeing posts for a couple of years that obstruction and destroying democracy make up the entire repug platform, and until recently I thought it was hyperbole; but now I have to agree. They truly have no beliefs or goals other than this.

## The ‘Good’ Republicans Are Bad, and the Bad Ones Are Batshit

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-good-republicans-are-bad-and-the-bad-ones-are-batshit?ref=home):

> Gosar is now even more far-right than Steve King, who was censured for his white nationalist statements back when Republicans at least pretended to give a shit. Trump taught Republicans that they can be as shitty as they want, and no one will stop them, as long as they don't cross Trump. William Butler Yeats must have been writing about the Republicans when he wrote that "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."

`/u/BillionTonsHyperbole` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/og72rg/the_good_republicans_are_bad_and_the_bad_ones_are/):

> So sick of hearing people fawning over potty-trained Republicans like Mitt Romney and Susan Collins.
> 
> You don't get to be a full-time arsonist and part-time firefighter while expecting people to respect your morals or courage.
