## Marjorie Taylor Greene May Have Just Been Caught in an Illegal Property Tax Scheme

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/marjorie-taylor-greene-may-have-just-been-caught-in-an-illegal-property-tax-scheme/):

> Now a TV station in her home state has dug up paperwork pointing to a problem that is far more than a PR issue: that Greene and her husband seem to have been claiming a lucrative tax break on two houses in two different Georgia counties, in violation of the law. Channel 2 Action News in Atlanta revealed last night that it had obtained paperwork through public records requests that showed Greene and her husband claiming what's called a "Homestead exemption" on two properties-one in Fulton Country and one in Floyd County, which is in the district that Greene now represents. "The property owners filed for homestead exemption in Fulton County in May of 2019 and it became effective for the 2020 tax year," the Fulton County Board of Assessors told the network.

## Romney: Capitol riot was 'an insurrection against the Constitution'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/553694-romney-capitol-riot-was-an-insurrection-against-the-constitution):

> Sen. called the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol an "Insurrection against the Constitution" as some GOP lawmakers sought to minimize the violence this week. It was an insurrection against the Constitution that resulted in severe property damage, severe injuries and death," he continued. Gosar declared that Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was shot by a Capitol Police after trying to breach the House chamber, was "Executed" while also stressing that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of "Natural causes." Sicknick suffered two strokes while responding to the mob attack.

> > “I was there,” Romney said. “What happened was a violent effort to interfere with and prevent the constitutional order of installing a new president. As such, it was an insurrection against the Constitution that resulted in severe property damage, severe injuries and death."
> 
> It's good to see that at least *some* Republicans are standing up for the truth instead of trying to gaslight the nation and lie about what happened on January sixth. I might not agree with Romney on much, but I can respect him having the spine to do this.

## Seth Rogen Breaks Down His Online Battle Against Ted Cruz — "To me, it seems I’m pointing out the fact that he’s a terrible man whose words have resulted in death," Rogen said of his ongoing Twitter spats with the Texas politician.

Summary of [original article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/seth-rogen-ted-cruz-twitter-fight-explained-1234953319/):

> Seth Rogen is not in a "Feud" with Sen. Ted Cruz. Rogen did acknowledge that there "Are people in my life who hold the beliefs that Ted Cruz holds," however, any efforts to try and engage with them this past year have been "Horrifying," he said. A spokesperson for Cruz tells The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: "We know Sen. Cruz is busy fighting to save the country from Biden's disastrous policies. It's surprising to see that he's living rent free in Seth Rogen's head at the same time."

## GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she's 'offended' by House Republicans minimizing the Capitol riot

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/lisa-murkowski-rejects-house-republicans-downplaying-capitol-riot-investigation-2021-5):

> GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Friday said that she was "Offended" by a number of House Republicans who have sought to minimize the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to CNN. Murkowski, who voted to convict former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial for his role in the riot, slammed revisionist attempts to label the insurrectionist mob's actions as "a normal tourist visit." "I'm offended by that," Murkowski told CNN. "This was not a peaceful protest. When somebody breaks and enters, and then just because you know they don't completely trash your house once you're inside does not mean that it has been peaceful. This was not a peaceful protest." Advocates of the commission hope an investigation would deter any further GOP attempts to downplay the riot, which has become a popular sentiment among some House Republicans.

> Oooo! You’re *offended* are you? Oh man…well *that* certainly sounds serious. I don’t suppose you’d consider taking it one step further by…oh, I dunno…actually *calling them out on their bullshit???*
