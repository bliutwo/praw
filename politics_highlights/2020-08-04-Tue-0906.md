## Postal Union Leader Warns Trump Assault on USPS and Mail-In Voting Puts Nation on 'Dangerous Path Toward Dictatorship'

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/08/04/postal-union-leader-warns-trump-assault-usps-and-mail-voting-puts-nation-dangerous):

> The leader of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union warned Monday that President Donald Trump's evidence-free attacks on mail-in voting, threat to delay the November election, and ongoing efforts to undermine the U.S. Postal Service are putting the nation on "a dangerous path toward dictatorship" and must be opposed. "When postal workers go to work every day, our commitment is not to politicians or political parties, it's to the people in every community across this country who we are proud to serve in this election season and for years to come." -Mark Dimondstein, American Postal Workers Union. Dimonstein's statement came amid growing alarm among postal workers, lawmakers, and voting rights advocates over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's recent policy changes that have resulted in significant mail backlogs and delays across the country-including in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

> Republicans know its a now or never scenario. Their parties shrinking, normal people have outgrown and educated themselves beyond the parties ideals. Without becoming authoritarian, it will disappear in millennials lifetime, and the old rich white men, and its temporarily inconvenienced poor white supporters cant have that.

## Donald Trump on the ropes in interview over US Covid-19 death toll

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/donald-trump-on-the-ropes-in-interview-over-us-covid-19-death-toll):

> Donald Trump visibly floundered in an interview when pressed on a range of issues, including the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the US, his claims that mail-in voting is fraudulent, and his inaction over the "Russian bounty" scandal. As it becomes apparent that Trump is talking about the number of deaths as a proportion of cases, Swan says said: "Oh, you're doing death as a proportion of cases. I'm talking about death as a proportion of population. That's where the US is really bad. Much worse than Germany, South Korea." Of Maxwell, Trump says "Her friend or boyfriend Epstein was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She's now in jail. Yeah, I wish her well." Trump goes on twice more to say of Epstein: "Was it suicide or was he killed?".

> Just finished watching the entire interview.
> 
> How you can watch this and say that Trump is even remotely in control (whether of the country, the virus, or his own mental faculties), is just beyond me.
> 
> Edit: masterful interview technique too: just enough antagonism to keep trump defensive, but enough reassurance to mollify him and keep him wanting more. Apparently Jonathan swan is a pimp.

## Trump replied 'you can't do that' when his interviewer pointed out the US's terrible record on COVID-19 deaths per capita

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-dismisses-us-high-covid-deaths-per-capita-axios-hbo-2020-8):

> President Donald Trump refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the high US death rate per capita from COVID-19 in a tumultuous interview where he instead argued for more flattering statistics. During the interview, Swan attempted to press him on this metric as cases surge in the US. According to statistics site Our World In Data, as of August 3 the US is currently the sixth-worst nation for coronavirus deaths per million. As a cumulative total of deaths per capita for the global outbreak so far, the US is eighth-worst in the world, after Belgium, UK, Peru, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, according to statistics website Statista.
