## Mystery of $220,000 of Trump’s presidential salary that he promised to donate but disappeared

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-salary-donation-white-house-b1893787.html?amp):

> A new report has raised questions about whether former President Donald Trump really donated his salary toward the end of his time in office, as he repeatedly did earlier in his term. Mr Trump is not one to let a good deed go unnoticed, so it would seem unlikely that he would quietly donate to a federal agency. As the Post, reported, Mr Trump is still receiving a government pension - which the former president has not pledged to donate.

> >As Griffith prepared to plead guilty to one count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building — a class B misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of six months in jail — US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell asked the prosecutor to explain why Griffith’s deal involved a class of crime typically reserved for people who did things like trespass in a national park at night.

> >“I’m just curious — does the government have any concern given the factual predicate at issue here, of the defendant joining a mob, breaking into the Capitol building through a broken door, wandering through the Capitol building and stopping a constitutionally mandated duty of the Congress and terrorizing members of Congress, the vice president, who had to be evacuated?” Howell asked. “Does the government, in agreeing to the petty offense in this case, have any concern about deterrence?”

## Trump Pressed Justice Dept. to Declare Election Results Corrupt, Notes Show

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/trump-justice-department-election.html):

> Mr. Trump did not name the lawmakers, but at other points during the call he mentioned Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, whom he described as a "Fighter"; Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who at the time promoted the idea that the election was stolen from Mr. Trump; and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, whom Mr. Trump praised for "Getting to bottom of things." In a moment of foreshadowing, Mr. Trump said, "People tell me Jeff Clark is great, I should put him in," referring to the acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, who had also encouraged department officials to intervene in the election. Two days after the phone call with Mr. Trump, Mr. Donoghue took notes of a meeting between Justice Department officials: Mr. Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows; the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone; and White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin met to discuss a conspiracy theory known as Italygate, which asserts without evidence that people in Italy used military technology to remotely tamper with voting machines in the United States.

## Leading academic warns that America is on precipice of losing democracy

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/leading-academic-america-precipice-democracy-b1893284.html):

> Mr Mann is a widely respected voice in US politics, regarded by members of both major parties as an expert on Congress and democracy. Mann told an LA Times reporter that a complete repudiation of Trumpism, in the 2022 midterms and then in the 2024 elections, is necessary to sideline the Republican Party's extreme fringes and put the GOP in a position to rebuild the party. America needs two strong governing parties, Mr Mann added, to keep each other in check.

`/u/bakulu-baka` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ouk997/leading_academic_warns_that_america_is_on/):

> Like the ‘coming threat’ of climate change, that precipice may already be in the rear-view mirror.
