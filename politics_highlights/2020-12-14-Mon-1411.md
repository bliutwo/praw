## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 49

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kd2mfo/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate news about Trump, Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood up for a local medic on Sunday night after a media report on the health-care worker creating an erotic OnlyFans account to help pay her bills. The Democratic congresswoman tweeted in response to a New York Post report entitled "NYC medic helped 'make ends meet' with racy OnlyFans side gig," about 23-year-old New York medic Lauren Caitlyn Kwei. The medic continued: "There are plenty of people who are medical professionals who have every right to do what they want with their own bodies. I'm not doing it at work. Health-care workers aren't making a lot of money. And I'm not the only one trying to make ends meet."

## 'The Actual Scandalous Headline Is Medics Need Two Jobs to Survive': AOC Defends Paramedic Outed by NY Post — "It's not like she does anything shameful for money, like writing for the New York Post."

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/14/actual-scandalous-headline-medics-need-two-jobs-survive-aoc-defends-paramedic-outed):

> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday night was among those who came to the defense of a New York City paramedic who the New York Post outed and attempted to shame in a recent article about her decision to earn extra money via nude modeling. The actual scandalous headline here is "Medics in the United States need two jobs to survive". It is a scandal that we pay paramedics so little that they need second jobs.

`/u/Blazer9001` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kd0kwr/the_actual_scandalous_headline_is_medics_need_two/):

> How god damn elitist do you need to be to attack a fucking nurse for starting an OnlyFans for a little extra money? No one gets hurt in these transactions, and the women don’t get ripped off like they do with other Big Porno avenues. And there’s more of these women than you think, hell a lot of them advertise themselves on reddit. 
> 
> New York Post is such fucking trash. Don’t they have some Hunter Biden Stole Candy from a Baby bullshit to peddle?
