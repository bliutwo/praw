## Cohen: Trump 'doesn't have a sense of humor,' isn't joking about being POTUS for '12 more years'

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/936490/cohen-trump-doesnt-have-sense-humor-isnt-joking-about-being-potus-12-more-years):

> President Trump is dead serious when he says he wants to be in the White House for 12 more years, Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney and fixer, said on Tuesday. "He wants to be the president for life. He wants to be just like Putin, just like Kim Jong Un, just like Maduro, just like Mohammad bin Salman. He craves this. He doesn't want to run for president, and that's why he says, 'What about 12 more years, 12 more years.' He's not joking." "He doesn't laugh, he doesn't tell jokes, he doesn't have a sense of humor. He means it when he says it." Cohen likened Trump to a "Cult leader," and said he wrote Disloyal in an attempt to "Really open the eyes of the 38 percent, the base of his, that no matter what Donald Trump does, it's acceptable to them. He doesn't care and they don't care. He wasn't joking again when he said that he could kill somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it. He means it." Catherine Garcia.

> That's why the anecdotes in Sarah Huckabee Sanders' book that said 'Trump was joking' or 'Trump was laughing' are likely complete bullshit lies - just like her press briefings were.

> >“Just to be clear, DOJ's argument that Trump was acting ‘within the scope of his employment’ when he defamed E. Jean Carroll is not an effort to take over defense of the suit; it's an effort to have the suit dismissed,”
> 
> They are claiming that him calling her a liar was part of his job as President?? 
> 
> Now apparently defamation is part of the job description.

## California’s GOP Senate leader was under quarantine. She spoke with no mask at a huge prayer event anyway.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/09/shannon-grove-church-quarantine-california/):

> In front of thousands of worshipers packed shoulder-to-shoulder outside the Capitol, California Senate Minority Leader Shannon Grove grabbed the microphone on Sunday and promised the huge church event would have a real impact. Grove has come under added fire because she was supposed to be quarantining after coming into close contact with state Sen. Brian Jones, who tested positive on Aug. 26 for covid-19. State health officials are urging anyone who attended the prayer event to self-quarantine and monitor for symptoms - but the group that organized it has already moved on to stage similarly mask-free events farther up the West Coast.

`/u/Swmando` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ipg7y0/californias_gop_senate_leader_was_under/):

> I’ve been camped in my living room for five months so that these idiots can ruin it for everyone. I missed summer, entirely. I hate them.

## GOP Lawyer Who’s Been Looking for Fraud ‘Each Election Day Since 1984’: Evidence Doesn’t Support Trump’s Claims

Summary of [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/gop-lawyer-whos-been-looking-for-fraud-each-election-day-since-1984-evidence-doesnt-support-trumps-claims/):

> An election lawyer who has spent four decades looking for evidence that might support the Republican Party's assertions about widespread, systemic fraud wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday that the data isn't there. In a self-fulfilling prophecy twist, President Donald Trump publicly "Instructed" voters to "Illegally vote twice," Benjamin Ginsberg wrote. The op-ed in The Washington Post did not address arguments made by Attorney General Bill Barr and President Donald Trump that universal mail-in voting would lead to widespread fraud.

Meanwhile, in a self-fulfilling prophecy twist, President Donald Trump publicly “instructed” voters to “illegally vote twice,” Benjamin Ginsberg wrote. [...]
> 
> > “Each Election Day since 1984, I’ve been in precincts looking for voting violations, or in Washington helping run the nationwide GOP Election Day operations, overseeing the thousands of Republican lawyers and operatives each election on alert for voting fraud,” he wrote. “The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents — by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged.”
> 
> > Ginsberg said that it is “painful” for him to conclude that “rule of law” Republicans are politicizing the mail-in vote and undermining the credibility thereof in order to gain an “electoral advantage,” not out of “sincere concern.”
> 
> Coming from a guy who has spent 3+ decades looking for voter fraud for the GOP...that believes there is always potentially voter fraud in elections...his perspective shoots down Trump’s arguments, while calling out the blatant deception for perceived political gain!
