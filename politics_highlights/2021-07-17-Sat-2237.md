## Fauci: US might 'still have polio' if media back then opposed vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210717-fauci-us-might-still-have-polio-if-media-back-then-opposed-vaccine):

> Top US scientist Anthony Fauci on Saturday blasted commentators who sound an anti-vaccination theme, saying America might still be battling smallpox and polio if today's kind of misinformation existed back then. Fauci was responding to a CNN interviewer who asked if he thought "We could have defeated the measles or eradicated polio if you had Fox News, night after night, warning people about these vaccine issues that are just bunk." Fauci said: "We probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio ... if we had the kind of false information that's being spread.".

## Watchdog says AT&T gave over $100K to Abbott, GOP lawmakers after vowing to support voting rights

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/563541-watchdog-says-att-gave-over-100k-to-abbott-gop):

> A left-leaning political watchdog group is calling on AT&T to hold firm in its commitment to support the expansion of voting rights after the company contributed thousands of dollars to Texas Republicans who oppose such measures. The reported contributions from AT&T come after CEO John Stankey said in April amid a wave of voting restrictions being proposed in GOP legislatures that the company believes "The right to vote is sacred and we support voting laws that make it easier for more Americans to vote in free, fair and secure elections." US said the executive's "Sentiments run totally counter to the sizable campaign support AT&T affiliated PACs are doling out to those scheming to strip fundamental voting rights from eligible voters."

> Joke's on us...  Can't effectively boycott AT&T if they're the only ISP available in your area.
