## How Ted Cruz ended up sharing Russian far-right propaganda to attack the US military

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-us-military-retweet-russian-far-right-propaganda-2021-5):

> A video shared by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz last week to attack the US military for being "Woke" and "Emasculated" originated from pro-Russian, anti-American far-right social media networks, experts on extremist propaganda have told Insider. The video, which had been initially uploaded to TikTok, sought to unfavorably compare a US military recruitment ad to a Russian army one. A spokesman for Cruz told Insider that the controversy over the source of the video was distracting from the more important issue of how "Wokeness" is undermining the US military.
