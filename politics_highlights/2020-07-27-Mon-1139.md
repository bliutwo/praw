> There's gonna be a meeting this Wednesday to see if the superintendent of the fifth largest school district in the country is going to get fired for lying to the Legislature.   In short: One of the bills that was under consideration during the special session allowed the CCSD to take any surplus money from individual schools and use it to fill its budget gap.  Superintendent told the school board and the Legislature that the language came from the Governor and Nevada Department of Education, when in reality it came from him.  Sisolak and the State Superintendent called him out for lying about it, and here we are.

## Trump only pivoted on coronavirus after reportedly being warned of spikes among 'our people' in red states

Summary of [original article](https://theweek.com/speedreads/927652/trump-only-pivoted-coronavirus-after-reportedly-being-warned-spikes-among-people-red-states):

> People close to President Trump told The Washington Post they think that, throughout most of the coronavirus pandemic, he struggled to wholly address the crisis because of an unwillingness to admit error, a positive feedback loop from advisers and Fox News, and a "Penchant for magical thinking" that led him to believe the virus would soon disappear. Per the Post, the pivot apparently came only after Trump realized his voting base was in danger. The advisers have also reportedly shared projections predicting surges in Midwestern battleground states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, all of which are key to Trump winning re-election.

`/u/a_reply_to_a_post` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hyt4f6/national_guard_commander_says_police_suddenly/):

> In every city that there were protests, basically police were inciting mayhem in how they police the protests.
> 
> In NYC, their routine move was to start boxing in protestors about a half an hour before the curfew kicked in, pushing people into a tighter space making it harder to disperse. Then about 5 minutes before the curfew, they would start pepper spraying "disorderlies" which would cause a panic and then as people would try to move / leave, they were picking people off for breaking curfew. So if you were passionate enough to protest til curfew, basically your options are stay in the crowd and deal with getting pepper sprayed and beaten by police, or take your chances getting out of the crowd and getting pepper sprayed / beaten / arrested to boot.

> Protect and serve, right?
