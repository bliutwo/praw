## The People v. Donald J. Trump The criminal case against him is already in the works — and it could go to trial sooner than you think.

Summary of [original article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-criminal-case.html?utm_medium=s1&utm_source=fb&utm_campaign=nym&fbclid=IwAR2GytWhcyaxB6oUjOYVWvLwRHhfMeIghpoCgn1-mBIlssikjIcCrAd0Ay8&fbclid=IwAR1ts2cBXuFIinJYqAvRnI2Vjcu5B4AewUcntpUuUrkfrSR-w1jf4Wdj4C8&fbclid=IwAR3F-47WzeOyatFBM72srUnWQH421usgWy9uMjRe_SyHF2bvsW9p3ec6OxA&fbclid=IwAR37C4Dk7094XONN-6OtpHuSFfDj0JVVLfkVVFOVf1jVhc0z6jZDGj73YPs):

> If Joe Biden is sworn in as president in January, his attorney general will inherit a mountain of criminal evidence against Trump accumulated by Robert Mueller and a host of inspectors general and congressional oversight committees. After taking office in 2010, he sought to reduce Jeffrey Epstein's status as a sex offender, dropped an investigation into whether Ivanka Trump and Donald Trumpâ€¯Jr. had committed fraud in the marketing of the Trump Soho, and initially decided not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein despite solid evidence of his sex crimes. The New York Times has detailed how Trump and his family have long falsified records to avoid taxes, and during testimony before Congress in 2019, Trump's longtime fixer Michael Cohen stated that Trump had inflated the value of his assets to obtain a bank loan.

> And here's the neat little trick: if The People vote this November, this trial and many others will all start to move forward blindingly quick. Trump, many members of his family, those advisors not already indicted or convicted, and hopefully a broad swath of corrupt politicians will all be moved into detention cells.

## Lock Him Up? For the Republic to survive Trump’s presidency, he must be tried for his crimes. Even if that sparks a constitutional crisis of its own.

> > Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins, if the law be transgressed to another’s harm; and whosoever in authority exceeds the power given him by the law, and makes use of the force he has under his command, to compass that upon the subject, which the law allows not, ceases in that to be a magistrate; and, acting without authority, may be opposed, as any other man, who by force invades the right of another. This is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. He that hath authority to seize my person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a robber, if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ, notwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant, and such a legal authority, as will impower him to arrest me abroad. And why this should not hold in the highest, as well as in the most inferior magistrate, I would gladly be informed.
> 
> That was written in 1689 by English philosopher John Locke. His works directly inspired our nation's founding and its values and principles. He makes clear that accountability is a fucking requirement, and any official who feels himself above the law shall be seized in the streets as the thief and robber he is. Fucking 1689 in England.

## Biden Creates Legal War Room, Preparing for a Big Fight Over Voting

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/politics/biden-legal-challenges-trump.html):

> The process of voting is especially complex now, as multiple states have raced to expand the ability to vote by mail because of the coronavirus. "Republicans have always supported absentee voting with safeguards in place and want to make sure every valid vote is counted and our elections are free, fair and transparent," Ms. Merritt said. Ms. Remus said the communications side of the Biden operation would encourage voters to request ballots soon, make a voting plan and cast a ballot as soon as possible.

> It's a fucking travesty that preparing for a contested transition is even needed. Yet here we are casually talking about tyranny, the very thing our founding fathers fucking abhored and sought to avoid.

He has leveraged his powerful international platform to promote his developments dozens of times. And he has directed millions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers to his businesses around the globe.
