## No one should be afraid of Donald Trump: He is the biggest loser in U.S. political history

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/01/20/no-one-should-be-afraid-of-donald-trump-he-is-the-biggest-loser-in-us-political-history/):

> For four years we have heard that Republicans are afraid to stand up to Donald Trump because he will insult them and humiliate them into submission. Trump did not have the guts to march with them to the Capitol - but he had no trouble sending them off into battle for his sole benefit. In 2016, Trump told the Republican National Convention and a national television audience, "Only I can fix it." But he could not fix our country because he exacerbated and capitalized on our grievances for his own personal and political gain.

`/u/OnlyLoveCanBreak` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/l194tu/no_one_should_be_afraid_of_donald_trump_he_is_the/):

> I am seriously sick of hearing about Trump’s powerful voting base. 
> 
> He won 1 election, against a historically unpopular democratic candidate. He still lost the popular vote by millions. Following his victory the GOP lost the house in 2018 and the senate in 2020. 
> 
> In 2020 he lost the popular vote by 7+ million and got a smaller vote share than Mitt Romney in 2012. He’s not this unstoppable electoral force people like to pretend he is.

## Donald Trump Has Just Left the White House—This Time, for Good

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-has-just-left-the-white-house-for-good):

> Donald Trump has left the White House for the last time as president, ending the most chaotic and divisive presidency in American history. Trump left the White House having been impeached twice-an unprecedented disgrace for a U.S. president. Before Trump departed the White House grounds on Marine One, he was heard telling reporters: "Hopefully it's not a long-term goodbye."

> I shit you not....his last act as President after his rambling, lie filled speech, was getting on Air Force One while YMCA played
> 
> Once a circus side show...always a circus side show

## Pressure Builds on Biden Admin to Prosecute Trump for 'Treason'

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pressure-builds-on-biden-admin-to-prosecute-trump-for-treason?ref=wrap):

> Biden, who will be inaugurated-despite every conceivable attempt by President Donald Trump to prevent that from happening-as the 46th president on Wednesday, has resolutely promised to separate his administration's political affairs from the DOJ he'll soon inherit, vowing total independence and delighting many who have longed for a restoration of the most basic democratic principles tested over the past four years. After witnessing the magnitude of the siege on his workplace, the Democratic congressman said that he would likely "Lose confidence" in Biden if he does not allow his DOJ to prosecute Trump. The day before the riot, Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House and a key Biden ally, expressed hope that DOJ might prosecute Trump for urging the Georgia Secretary of State to toss out the state's presidential election result, after a call between the two men leaked.

> Keyword: Biden *Admin*
> 
> Biden doesn't have to spend a moment worrying about that. After four years, the DOJ can start actually doing their job.
