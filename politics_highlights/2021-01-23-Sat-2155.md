> He's 100% correct. The most important thing is to get COVID under control so society can return to normal. Then we need stimulus spending focused on the middle class to kick things into high gear, and an increase in the minimum wage.

> Democrats will be well-positioned going into the 2022 midterms of they can alleviate much of the current economic anxiety.

> > 
> > "Hawley is Senator of Missouri. His constituents are ALL the people of Missouri - which is the same state that JUST elected sister @CoriBush, the first Black woman to ever represent MO in Congress," she added.

> > "So Hawley really needs to clarify who he considers a constituent & who he doesn't," she wrote.
> 
> She's definitely not wrong on this one.
> 
> Hawley spent weeks encouraging these terrorists and helping to incite an attack on the Capitol. He even gave the terrorists a fist in solidarity as he was leaving the Capitol. And now he's trying to play dumb and act like he has no idea what he did or that it could lead to what it did.

## George Conway hands Biden's DOJ a roadmap to make sure Trump ends up in jail: Conway notes that future Attorney General Merrick Garland must appoint a special counsel — or two

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2021/01/23/george-conway-hands-bidens-doj-a-roadmap-to-make-sure-trump-ends-up-in-jail/):

> On Friday night, writing for The Washington Post, conservative attorney George Conway laid out the way forward to investigate former President Donald Trump for his criminal conduct in office now that he is a private citizen - and prosecute him where appropriate. " Vance is running a state investigation, but if Trump has committed bank or insurance fraud, that would be chargeable as federal offenses as well, including mail or wire fraud," wrote Conway. "So, too, with state tax offenses, given how Trump's federal and state returns would no doubt track one another. Trump apparently had good reason to be concerned about who would fill [Preet] Bharara's old job."

> If they/AG/senate let the Orange Turd Cockroach Liar walk away from his high crimes again, they'll be inviting the permanent demise of this great country.

## Trump made 30,573 false or misleading claims as president. Nearly half came in his final year.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html):

> Trump averaged about six claims a day in his first year as president, 16 claims day in his second year, 22 claims day in his third year - and 39 claims a day in his final year. False and misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic emerged in 2020, so that by year's end he had made more than 2,500 cornavirus-related claims - more than all of his trade claims over four years, even though trade has been one of the animating features of his presidency. Trump's penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded about 750 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.

## Sen. Tom Cotton Bragged He Was an 'Army Ranger.' He Was Not

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tom-cotton-army-ranger-school-1118418/):

> Cotton, who first ran for Congress in 2012, claimed during that campaign that he had served as "a U.S. Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan" and "Volunteered to be an Army Ranger." But, Sollenberger uncovered, Cotton never was an Army Ranger, he only attended the Army's two-month Ranger School. The U.S. Army Ranger Course, on the other hand, which Cotton did attend, is described as "The Army's premier leadership school" and is "Open to all members of the military." A school literally anyone in the military can attend is a far cry from the RASP, which the Army says is "Designed to test a Soldier's physical and mental strength under extreme conditions." Any actual member of the 75th Ranger Regiment would be more of a Ranger than Tom Cotton will ever be.

## Biden orders assessment of domestic extremism risk, White House says

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSKBN29R2EH?il=0):

> 2 Min Read.WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden has directed his administration to conduct a full assessment of the risk of domestic terrorism in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, the White House said on Friday. The assessment will be carried out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in coordination with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. "The January 6th assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat. The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve," Psaki said.
