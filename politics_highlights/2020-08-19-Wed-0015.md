## Trump was 'infuriated' by efforts to stop Russian election meddling, ex-DHS official alleges

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/election-2020-russia-meddling-homeland-security-trump-miles-taylor-a9676926.html):

> "We were quite literally told, 'Do not bring up issues related to Russia with the president. It might be counterproductive,'" said Miles Taylor, a former DHS chief of staff who has endorsed Joe Biden's presidency in a damning op-ed column and in a video from an anti-Trump Republican group. At one meeting to discuss US counties facing potential election threats, the president "Wanted to talk about how many counties he had won in 2016.". The president's "Indiscipline was also a constant source of frustration," he claimed, pointing to a February 2019 meeting to avoid a possible government shutdown in which Mr Trump held a phone briefing with DHS to "Discuss the colour of the wall".

## Colin Powell backs Biden ahead of DNC appearance

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/colin-powell-endorse-biden-2020-c2e12496-242f-4b87-b3bf-2f5d925ccac5.html):

> Former Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed Joe Biden for president and will appear at the Democratic Convention Tuesday evening, NBC first reported. Why it matters: Powell is the highest profile Republican to cross party lines, throwing his support behind Biden and adding his name to a growing list of GOP voices who are encouraging voters to support the former vice president over President Trump. "For Joe Biden, that doesn't need teaching - it comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families."

`/u/alexxerth` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/icd1b9/colin_powell_backs_biden_ahead_of_dnc_appearance/):

> Is it bad that I hope the DNC just becomes the new center right party, the Republicans just stop existing as a viable party, and we get an actual left leaning party in the US?

> Former President Jimmy Carter went to bat for Joe Biden at Tuesday night's Democratic National Convention saying Biden "Must be our next president." What he's saying: "Joe Biden was my first and most effective support in the senate. For decades he's been my loyal and dedicated friend," Carter said. "He's has the experience character and decency to bring us together. You deserve a person with integrity and judgment. Someone who's 100% fair, someone who's committed to what is best for the American people. Joe is that kind of leader and he's the right person for this moment in our nation's history."

> How tone deaf and arrogant can Trump be? After he DODGES military service with a phony doctors note supplied by his rich daddy, he has the nerve to make statements like "I like people who weren't captured" about hero McCain. SMH.

## Trump says "we'll look at" treating COVID with an untested, toxic plant extract touted by MyPillow CEO

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-oleandrin-covid-treatment-toxic-plant/):

> President Trump suggested he's open to looking at a botanical extract being touted by a major donor, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, as a treatment for COVID-19, even though it comes from a poisonous plant and there have been no medical studies to show if it's safe or effective in people. Lindell says the CEO of the company, Andrew Whitney, contacted him on Easter Sunday to tout the extract as a cure. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Lindell said he has been taking oleandrin since April and referred to it as "The miracle of all time." He claimed that the extract has been tested on humans but offered no evidence of this.

> Fuck the scientists with their fancy degrees and years of experience. I’m going with the medical advice of a former crack addict that sells pillows via infomercials.
