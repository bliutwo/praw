> Why did the Trump administration do nothing to protect our election from this massive, widespread voter fraud that they are claiming? If what they are saying is true, wouldn't that mean that Trump is dangerously incompetent and unqualified because he did nothing to address the threat? Voter fraud on the scale they are alleging would be one of the greatest attacks ever perpetrated on the United States, yet it happened under Trump's watch. Even of their obviously batshit election conspiracy theories were correct, wouldn't it be a damning indictment on Trump's ability to run the country and keep us safe?

## Poll: Two-Thirds of Americans Favor Raising Taxes on Incomes Over $400K

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/12/03/poll-two-thirds-americans-favor-raising-taxes-incomes-over-400k):

> A compelling majority of Americans favor raising taxes on people who make more than $400,000 per year, according to a new poll published Thursday by the New York Times and Survey Monkey. Among people who identify as either Democrats or Democrat-leaning, support for raising taxes on those making more than $400,000 is, at 88%, overwhelming. Biden's tax plan would raise the top tax rate for people with the highest incomes to 39.6%. On related issues of economic inequality, the new survey also found that nearly two-thirds of respondents favor making four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free for any students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually.
