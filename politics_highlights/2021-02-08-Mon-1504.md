## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 6

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lfg7ej/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

## Jared and Ivanka made up to $640 million in the White House

Summary of [original article](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/jared-and-ivanka-made-up-to-640-million-in-the-white-house/):

> Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump reported between $172 million and $640 million in outside income while working in the White House, according to an analysis of financial disclosures by CREW. It is impossible to tell the exact amount as the income is sometimes reported in broad ranges and cover four months of income before Ivanka Trump officially joined her father's administration and nearly one month before Jared Kushner joined. All told, Ivanka made more than $13 million from the hotel since 2017, dropping from about $4 million a year between 2017 and 2019 to about $1.5 million last year, at least in part due to the pandemic. In 2018, Ivanka announced she was shutting down her namesake brand, and she later filed a disclosure with the government that "[a]ll operations of the business ceased on July 31, 2018." But we discovered that she still made up to $1 million.

> $160 *million* each year. Please, would someone explain how this is legal, and wasn’t just completely illegal grifting?

## Trump’s Crack Impeachment Lawyers Misspelled ‘United States’—Again

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzk3z/trumps-crack-impeachment-lawyers-misspelled-united-statesagain):

> Hardly a week after submitting a legal brief for Trump's looming Senate impeachment trial that misspelled the words "United States," they made exactly the same blunder again on Monday in the pre-trial brief laying out their defense. "President's Trump speech on January 6, 2021, was not an act encouraging an organized movement to overthrow the Unites States government," the new document reads. Last week, Democrats dared Trump to testify under oath at his own impeachment trial, although their offer was quickly rebuffed as a "Public relations stunt" by Trump's lawyers.

## Over 50 House Democrats are opposed to Biden lowering the $75,000 income threshold for stimulus checks. Here's what they're saying.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-relief-democrats-oppose-biden-lowering-income-threshold-stimulus-checks-2021-2):

> Over 50 House Democrats sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Friday requesting that the income threshold for the next round of stimulus payments remain at $75,000, ensuring families who need the payments are not left out. With the $1,400 stimulus checks Biden proposed as part of his $2 trillion stimulus package, the income threshold has been a subject of debate, with one group of Republicans suggesting the threshold be lowered to $40,000, and a bipartisan group of senators pushing to exclude higher-income families from receiving stimulus checks. Biden indicated that he would be willing to compromise on the eligibility requirements for stimulus checks, but now that Democrats are moving forward with budget reconciliation, the $75,000 income threshold originally included in the president's plan could likely stay.

> Cant give full benefit checks to fewer people than Trump did. That’s bad politics and bad policy.
