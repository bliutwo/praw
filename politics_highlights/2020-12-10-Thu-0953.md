## The Kraken Is Dead: Sidney Powell's Final Lawsuit Just Got Dismissed

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dpypz/the-kraken-is-dead-sidney-powells-final-lawsuit-just-got-dismissed):

> In a series of lawsuits filed by former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell she promised to "Release the Kraken" by making explosive claims about widespread voter fraud in four states. On Wednesday night, Powell's Kraken was finally slain: a judge in Wisconsin dismissed the fourth and final lawsuit, noting that it is voters, not judges, who decide who goes to the White House. "The plaintiff asserts that these words appear on page 4 of the Swaffer decision: 'even though the election has passed, the meeting of electors obviously has not, so plaintiff's claim here is hardly moot.' The court has read page 4 of Swaffer three times and cannot find these words," the ruling read. Just hours before Pepper handed down her decision, a federal judge in Arizona dismissed another of Powell's Kraken lawsuits.
