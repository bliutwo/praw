> 
> And they feel safe in doing this because they know a Democrat wouldn’t pull this shit, so they’re not worried about the precedent hurting *them*

## Raffensperger refuses to rule out investigation and says Trump is ‘just plain wrong’ after leaked call. 'He had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two … he has bad data’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-raffensperger-georgia-leaked-call-b1782026.html):

> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has spoken out about the controversial phone call he had with President Donald Trump obtained by the Washington Post in which he was pressured to overturn his state's results in the 2020 elections. Mr Raffensperger spoke for the first time to ABC's Good Morning America on Monday after a recording of his phone call with the president on Saturday drew national media attention and raised questions about whether Mr Trump violated state election laws by urging him to overturn the results. On Saturday, after the White House reportedly attempted to arrange a call between Mr Trump and Mr Raffensperger at least 18 times, the two finally spoke about Georgia's historic election results.

## Trump tapes worse than Watergate, Bernstein says. ‘The one thing we should recall from Watergate is that the heroes of Watergate were Republicans who would not tolerate Richard Nixon’s conduct,’ Mr. Bernstein said

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-georgia-watergate-carl-bernstein-b1781889.html):

> Mr Bernstein, who is known for his investigative reporting work in the 1972 Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, said: "It's not deja vu. This was something far worse than occurred in Watergate." "We have both a criminal president of the US in Donald Trump and a subversive president at the same time in this one person subverting the very basics of our democracy and willing to act criminally in that subversion," Mr Bernstein told CNN. He said this is the "Ultimate smoking gun tape with the evidence of what this president is willing to do to undermine the electoral system and illegally, improperly and immorally try to instigate a coup in which he remains the president of the US.". Mr Bernstein, who has criticised Mr Trump several times in 2020, emphasised that "In any other presidency, this tape would be evidence enough to result in the impeachment of the president of the US, his conviction in the Senate and an immediate call by the members of Congress including of his own party that he resign immediately."

> They're not just tolerating it, they're outright endorsing it.

## Worse Than Treason | No amount of rationalizing can change the fact that the majority of the Republican Party is advocating for the overthrow of an American election.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/what-republicans-are-doing-worse-treason/617538/):

> Today, the "Sedition caucus" includes at least 140 members of the House-that is, some two-thirds of the House GOP membership-and at least 10 members of the Senate. Perhaps the sedition caucus didn't mean to go this far. Shredding the Constitution purely for personal gain is perhaps the worst of the sins of the sedition caucus.

`/u/roscoe_e_roscoe` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kq74ow/worse_than_treason_no_amount_of_rationalizing_can/):

> It's hard to accept how awful this situation has become.  The Republicans were so bad they chose Trump, then he made them worse

## Trump faces calls for impeachment over Georgia phone call: ‘This is rank lawlessness happening domestically’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-georgia-phone-call-b1781961.html):

> President Donald Trump is facing a string of calls for a second impeachment after a phone call to Georgia's election chief pressuring him to overturn his election defeat was released over the weekend. The call has sparked an immediate widespread backlash from lawyers, politicians, and members of the public, with many saying his actions warrant a second impeachment before Mr Trump leaves office. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci described the scandal on CNN on Sunday as "Rank lawlessness happening domestically" saying the president "Needs to be impeached again."

`/u/TheBirminghamBear` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kq9rcu/trump_faces_calls_for_impeachment_over_georgia/):

> Impeach the motherfucker again. 
> 
> For fuck's sake this is such an easy call.  Impeach him again and let Republicans once more vote to keep this treasonous fucking piece of shit in office because they're too fucking greedy for the support of his rabid fanbase to do the right thing. 
> 
> Let them go on record exonerating, for a second time, a sack of dogshit that let 350,000 Americans die while working overtime to overthrow the democratic results of an election.
> 
> Force them to greenlight a few short miserable weeks of this petulant child's continued tantrum while representing the highest office in America, and let them truly demonstrate how fucking far they've let this country sink on their watch.
