## The "What happened in your state last week?" Megathread, Week 18

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n406lu/the_what_happened_in_your_state_last_week/):

> Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed.

> In the New York City mayor race, the progressive front runner who was building momentum had a #MeToo accusation against him from back in 2001. (Scott Stringer)
> 
> It’s sort of messy, because no other people came forward and, like, on one hand I’m big on “believe victims” and could believe that Stringer could behave that way, but also Stringer outright denies the facts and this woman is a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry, which Stringer attacked recently.
> 
> A lot of people recinded their endorsements, a lot of other people don’t seem to care.
> 
> I dunno, it sucks. I think he was going to be the guy to beat Yang but things look scary now

## The Republican Party Is for Liars Only | Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney are discovering that there’s no room in the GOP for anyone who acknowledges that Biden beat Trump fair and square.

Summary of [original article](https://newrepublic.com/article/162294/mitt-romney-liz-cheney-resist-trumpism-big-lie):

> "We've got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world," Trump told supporters in his infamous January 6 speech before the riot. Her continued criticism of Trump is highly inconvenient for a party that wants to pretend that the insurrection didn't happen and largely supports Trump's return to power on the false grounds that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The Wyoming Republican Party voted to censure Cheney for her role in Trump's impeachment proceedings in January.

> Bush and Trump literally lost the popular vote yet still became President. Neither showed humility about it and the Republican proudly marched forward relentlessly pursuing their agendas. Biden won the most votes in history and beat Trump by 7 million votes despite Republican efforts to disenfranchise and confuse voters. Still Republicans have the nerve to cry foul and complain. It is pitiful.

## Ted Cruz's threat to 'woke CEOs' was 'the most openly corrupt thing any Senator has said,' ethics expert says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ethics-expert-calls-out-ted-cruzs-criticism-of-woke-ceos-2021-5):

> An expert in government ethics has described Ted Cruz's newspaper column on "Woke CEOs" as the "Most openly corrupt thing any Senator has said." Cruz faced a backlash to the column for suggesting that, "This time," he and other Republican lawmakers would stop offering corporations potentially unethical tax breaks and other multibillion-dollar exemptions in return for financial contributions to their political causes. Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said on Twitter that Cruz had appeared to admit that he and others had sold "Access" in exchange for funding.

> For now. Dude shoots his foot on the daily and considers them as wins. Only because the right wing media and voters somehow see it that way too. Ya know there's something we can learn from these maniacs and how to use their strats against them.

## Charlie Crist, a Florida Democrat, will run against DeSantis for governor.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/us/charlie-crist-florida-governor.html):

> May 4, 2021, 9:21 a.m. ET.MIAMI - Representative Charlie Crist, Democrat of Florida, entered the race for governor on Tuesday, becoming the first challenger to Ron DeSantis, a Republican who raised his profile during the pandemic and is now one of the best-known governors in the country and a leading contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2024."Every step of the way, this governor has been more focused on his personal political fortune than the struggle of everyday Floridians," Mr. Crist said under the blazing sun in St. Petersburg. Earlier, in a video posted on Twitter, Mr. Crist said: "Today, Florida has a governor that's only focused on his future, not yours." In advance of Mr. Crist's announcement, Mr. DeSantis held an official event on Monday at Mr. Crist's favorite seafood restaurant in St. Petersburg, touting the wins he racked up during the annual legislative session that concluded last week - a session that he and Republicans in control of the Legislature used to champion policies that will appeal to Florida's increasingly conservative electorate.

> A Florida Democrat? Wouldn't it make more sense to point out that he was the former Republican governor?

## The GOP's devotion to Trump threatens to destroy American democracy

`/u/Gaerielyafuck` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/n4kbit/the_gops_devotion_to_trump_threatens_to_destroy/):

> The fealty to Trump truly boggles the mind. He's the biggest ass I have ever seen in American politics. He's so fucking *mean*. He enjoys hurting people whether through insults or actually damaging their rep and careers. He gets off on having power and bending people to his will. He taunts, mocks, belittles, lies and self-aggrandizes like an overgrown schoolyard bully.
> 
> But he's also a huge weenie. Firing people via tweet or through an intermediary, then going on TV saying shit like he told them face to face and they cried and called him sir and begged for their jobs...wtf. He adores Putin, Kim, MSB and even Xi for a minute, but blatantly insults our allies. 
> 
> He's a serial cheater who obviously doesn't respect the idea of marriage. How are supporters okay with him fucking a pornstar while the First Lady they all adore was home nursing a newborn? He had a personal lawyer give her over 100k to keep quiet!!! Then tried to sue her? So they turn around to point and laugh at the Clintons. Family values ftw.
> 
> He seems to understand almost nothing about American politics, whether history or protocol. I think he actually believed that a president was basically a king wielding power. He had his private attorney performing the function of a diplomat or cabinet member ffs. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. After the years of promising to lock up Hillary, Obama and Biden and whipping people into a frenzy over it, he has the audacity to cry deep state foul when he himself is under investigation.
> 
> He offers no ideas of his own, no incisive analysis of existing problems or any real plan for success. He is a cult of personality that lures followers by assuring them that libs ARE evil communists who will take your guns then kill you, Christianity IS under attack, the gays ARE hunting your children, the blacks ARE burning cities then coming for you, women ARE aborting babies regularly just to get pregnant later that same day, Mexicans ARE here to steal jobs and rape your women, America IS the best country ever with no problems and if you mention any you hate freedom....the list goes on. Don't forget to donate to save our Great Country!
> 
> Trump is the embodiment of all our worst impulses. His survival depends upon the fear and hatred which he has nurtured. Hell, he is campaigning to unseat fellow party members who don't support him and siccing surrogates on them. *How is that okay?* The Right has clearly lost control of him. They know it and so does Trump. I don't know how to combat that.

## Republicans say court packing is 'unconstitutional.' They're wrong. - The argument that court expansion is unconstitutional is weak, transparently political — and most importantly, wrong

Summary of [original article](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/republicans-say-court-packing-unconstitutional-they-re-wrong-n1265972):

> In 1866, radical Republicans in Congress, locked in battle with Democratic President Andrew Johnson, reduced the size of the court to seven seats. The Republicans likewise restored the court to nine seats in April 1869 - as soon as a Republican was once again president. Just in the last three months, conservatives flocked to arguments that it's unconstitutional for the Senate to conduct an impeachment trial of a former president; that it's unconstitutional for Congress to make the District of Columbia a state; and now that it's somehow unconstitutional for Congress to do something it's already done seven times in American history: alter the size of the Supreme Court.
