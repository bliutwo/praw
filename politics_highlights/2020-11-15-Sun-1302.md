## Obama says Trump has caused ‘damage’ by refusing to concede defeat and warns: ‘This is not normal’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/obama-trump-biden-election-interview-b1723261.html):

> Barack Obama says Donald Trump has caused 'damage' by refusing to concede defeat in this month's election, and warned the nation: 'This is not normal'. He added that it has been "Disappointing" to see few Republicans stand up to Mr Trump, who refuses to concede the election more than a week after it was called. "But there's damage to this because what happens is that the peaceful transfer of power, the notion that any of us who attain an elected office, whether it's dogcatcher or president, are servants of the people. It's a temporary job. We're not above the rules, we're not above the law, that's the essence of our democracy."

> Not only is he doing everything in his power to try and overturn the results of the election, he's also trying to cause as many problems as possible with the transition to screw over the next administration. It's just tiresome and childish; really makes me look forward to having an adult in the White House again after Joe Biden is inaugurated.
