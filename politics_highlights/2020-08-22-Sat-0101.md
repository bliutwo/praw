## Friday Fun Thread

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/idz8gx/friday_fun_thread/):

> It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some lychee juice, argue about which Q4 2020 game will be best, and talk about what's going on in your life. As always remember to follow our civility rules and save any meta feedback for our modmail. Please do not post anything directly related to politics in the Friday Fun Thread. We'd like these threads to be a refuge from the often-stressful political cycle.

> The number of comments I've *almost* posted is far greater than the number of comments I have actually made. 
> 
> Padres have now hit a grand slam four games in a row.  Lucky but still impressive.

> Trump is trying to obstruct the right to vote through his man at the Post Office. He has admitted this, out loud. Why aren't reporters holding his feet to the fire every second of every day about how he is breaking the law and his oath?
> 
> That's my question. The 4th estate is letting him get away scott free, reporting heinous crimes and forgetting them with the following news cycle. Tell me why he isn't being accused of breaking the law and being called a liar at every news conference. 
> 
> Until you can do that, I really don't care much about an explanation of how to get my vote to count through this mind boggling suppression.
> 
> Edit: YOUR OWN PUBLICATION reported Trump wants to send sheriffs to polling locations. That's not legal. Where is the intrepid reporter telling that to the man's face and laughing off his inane reply? You should be ripping the man to pieces, not explaining how to get around all these ridiculous new "rules and situations"

## Warren calls for Postal Service board members to fire DeJoy or resign

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/513198-warren-calls-for-postal-service-board-members-to-fire-dejoy-or-resign):

> Sen. said board members for the U.S. Postal Service should fire Postmaster General or resign themselves amid controversy over planned changes he's announced. If the Board won't fire Louis DeJoy and reverse the damage, they should resign too. "Managing the Postal Service in an efficient and effective manner cannot succeed if everything is politicized," DeJoy said, adding that he has never discussed the Postal Service with President Trump.

## Vermont GOP governor says he won't vote for Trump

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/podcasts/513171-vermont-gop-governor-says-he-wont-vote-for-trump-would-consider-backing):

> Scott, a vocal critic of the White House who previously said he didn't vote for Trump in 2016, said at a press conference he's been "Quite adamant in not supporting the president" and affirming "I won't be voting for President Trump." The Vermont Republican had also said earlier this year that Trump "Shouldn't be in office," and he supported House Democrats' impeachment proceedings against him in 2019. ADVERTISEMENT. Scott's opposition to Trump is not particularly surprising given his endorsement of , the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, in the 2020 GOP primary.

> Somewhere an aide just pointed to a map where Vermont is and Trump marked it out with a sharpie.

## Internal USPS memo appears to contradict postmaster general's testimony. Salon has obtained a USPS internal memo that casts doubt on the truthfulness of DeJoy's Senate testimony

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/21/internal-usps-memo-appears-to-contradict-postmaster-generals-testimony/):

> Postmaster General Louis DeJoy Salon has obtained a USPS internal memo that casts doubt on the truthfulness of DeJoy's Senate testimony. Salon has obtained internal U.S. Postal Service documents that appear to contradict Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's congressional testimony on Friday, in which he told a Senate panel under oath that he was not cutting employee overtime. The memo, which was provided by a manager to rank-and-file employees, appears to confirm reports that under DeJoy the agency is implementing policies aimed at dramatically curtailing the opportunity for worker overtime, to the point that the memo says flatly on its first page: "Overtime will be eliminated."

`/u/Custergrant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ie7qui/internal_usps_memo_appears_to_contradict/):

> Of course there's a paper trail. I try to be thankful that these jackasses are fucking idiots when it comes to committing crimes.
