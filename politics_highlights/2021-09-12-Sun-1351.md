## 23 states have COVID-19 cases that surpasses the national average. 21 of them voted for Trump, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-vast-majority-of-worst-affected-states-voted-trump-wapo-2021-9):

> There's a significant political divide in how US states are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, and red states are faring much worse, according to The Washington Post. Of the 23 states that have a total of new COVID-19 cases per capita that surpasses the national ratio, the media outlet reported that 21 voted for Trump in November. Of the 18 states that have new death totals higher than the national ratio, the data shows that 14 voted for the former president.

> A state voting for Trump is almost a 100% correlation with high COVID rates. It's pretty amazing when you think about it.

## Biden Tells Top Democrats He’s Preparing Lobbying Blitz on Filibuster Reform, Voting Rights | The president, sources say, has promised to lean on centrists to change the filibuster rules and save Democrats’ imperiled effort to pass a new voting rights bill

Summary of [original article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-filibuster-voting-rights-corruption-manchin-sinema-1224269):

> WASHINGTON - With a make-or-break vote looming in the Senate on a sweeping voting-rights and anti-corruption bill, President Joe Biden and his advisers have said in recent weeks that Biden will pressure wavering Democrats to support reforming the filibuster if necessary to pass the voting bill. Rep. Jim Clyburn, whose timely endorsement helped rescue Biden's flailing presidential campaign in early 2020, begged Biden to endorse a filibuster carve-out for voting rights. A few months after that, Psaki declined to say whether Biden backed creating a carve-out to the filibuster for legislation related to voting rights while also distancing the White House from any potential negotiations about filibuster reform.

## Biden Declassifies Secret FBI Report Detailing Saudi Nationals' Connections To 9/11

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/12/1036389448/biden-declassifies-secret-fbi-report-detailing-saudi-nationals-connections-to-9-):

> Biden Declassifies Secret FBI Report Detailing Saudi Nationals' Connections To 9/11 The families of 9/11 victims say the FBI document validates their claim that Saudi Arabia played a role in the attacks. The Biden administration has declassified a 16-page FBI report tying 9/11 hijackers to Saudi nationals living in the United States. The Saudi government has long maintained that any connections between Saudi nationals and the hijackers were coincidental, and have pointed to years of fighting al-Qaida in partnership with the U.S. "No evidence has ever emerged to indicate that the Saudi government or its officials had previous knowledge of the terrorist attack or were in any way involved in its planning or execution," officials said in a statement this week released by the Saudi embassy.

`/u/ExistTenseNow` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pmqewg/biden_declassifies_secret_fbi_report_detailing/):

> The evidence is circumstantial at best, yet it is tragically funny how Iraq gets bombed because of 'links' but not Saudi Arabia. Oil is thicker than blood, presumably.

## Child Covid deaths more than doubled in Florida as kids returned to the classroom

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/09/09/child-covid-fatalities-nearly-double-in-florida-1390807):

> TALLAHASSEE - Florida reached another grim Covid milestone amid the Delta surge: Since August, the number of Covid-related child deaths in the state has more than doubled. The deaths since July 30 also occurred as hundreds of thousands of kids in Florida began returning to classrooms and amid the ongoing fight between DeSantis and school districts over student mask mandates. While the 17 child deaths may seem low compared to the older adults, the increase of six deaths in August is an inevitable result of more kids becoming infected, according to officials at the Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville.

`/u/Maxfunky` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pmvteu/child_covid_deaths_more_than_doubled_in_florida/):

> I'm super suspicious of Florida's numbers lately.  They have more active cases than any state and as many new cases per day as Texas but I'm supposed to believe that 1/50th to 1/100th as many people are dying per day as in Texas? The number of deaths started dropping about 2 weeks ago right after two big editorials came out criticizing DeSantis and a new public opinion poll showed his popularity way down.  But the number of cases didn't start dropping at the same time--just the deaths. 
> 
> Am I supposed to believe that the state of medical care in Florida is just light years beyond what patients receive in Texas or in any other southern state?
