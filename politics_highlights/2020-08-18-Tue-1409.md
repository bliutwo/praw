## Postmaster General Louis DeJoy “gave $400,000 to Republicans just this year” and has “between $30 and $75 million in assets of direct competitors to the United States Postal Service.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/18/really-american/ad-watch-postmaster-general-republican-donor-inves/):

> DeJoy's investments in USPS competitors are less certain, but government documents suggest he could own more than $75 million in assets. Really American is correct to say that DeJoy has a financial interest in companies that provide services similar to the USPS. But is the postmaster general also a Republican donor, as the PAC claims? In total, DeJoy has contributed more than $915,000 to Trump's re-election campaign since February 2018, according to the FEC. Congressional Democrats questioned DeJoy's political and business ties soon after he was appointed in May. CNN reported Aug. 14 that the USPS inspector general is investigating DeJoy for potential ethics conflicts and reviewing some of his policy changes, such as eliminating overtime and slowing some mail delivery.

> I don't see the conflict of interest. It's in his best interest to destroy the USPS, and he's not conflicted by that. /s

## Fact Check: Michigan's rejection of ballots from dead voters is an example of the system working, not fraud

> > As the President continues his efforts to discredit voting by mail, he and his allies have pointed to several so-called examples of voter fraud. The latest favorite? More than 800 ballots that were received by mail from "dead voters" in Michigan's recent state-wide primary.
> On Twitter Saturday, Donald Trump Jr. shared a tweet about a Breitbart article. The framing of the article and the tweet insinuated that hundreds of ballots were not legitimately cast and perpetuated the President's claim that voting by mail is rife with fraud.
> Facts First: What happened in Michigan was not voter fraud but an example of the system working the way it's supposed to. Michigan's voter verification processes identified ballots from individuals who had died after submitting their ballot. Election officials did not count these ballots, in line with the state

## Trump: More Americans Have Died Under My Watch Than Michelle Obama Gives Me Credit For - A winning 2020 slogan.

Summary of [original article](https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/08/trump-michelle-obama-coronavirus-deaths/):

> It didn't take long for President Trump to hit back at Michelle Obama after the former first lady, in a searing speech for the Democratic National Convention on Monday, made the case for why he's simply not up to the job. Trump apparently wanted to remind everyone that more Americans have died from the coronavirus under his watch than a political opponent had given him credit him for. Trump disses Michelle Obama: "She was over her head, and frankly, she should've made the speech live, which she didn't do, she taped it. And it was not only taped, it was tape a long time ago, because she had the wrong deaths." pic.

`/u/Hairydone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ic4ld0/trump_more_americans_have_died_under_my_watch/):

> It’s pathetic how bad Trump is at campaigning. It was easy for him in 2016 when he could blame everyone else for mistakes and he had no track record as a politician. He has stuck to the same strategy despite being the one who has created all the problems.
