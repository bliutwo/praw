## People who support a ban on pornography tend to hold more sexist views about women. Generally, consuming pornography or supporting legal pornography was either non-predictive of sexism, or predicted lower sexism

> 
> >**Abstract:** The Texas freeze of February 2021 left more than 4.5 million customers (more than 10 million people) without electricity at its peak, some for several days. The freeze had cascading effects on other services reliant upon electricity including drinking water treatment and medical services. Economic losses from lost output and damage are estimated to be $130 billion in Texas alone. In the wake of the freeze, there has been major fallout among regulators and utilities as actors sought to apportion blame and utilities and generators began to settle up accounts. This piece offers a retrospective on what caused the blackouts and the knock-on effects on other services, the subsequent financial and political effects of the freeze, and the implications for Texas and the country going forward. Texas failed to sufficiently winterize its electricity and gas systems after 2011. Feedback between failures in the two systems made the situation worse. Overall, the state faced outages of 30 GW of electricity as demand reached unprecedented highs. The gap between production and demand forced the non-profit grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), to cut off supply to millions of customers or face a systems collapse that by some accounts was minutes away. The 2021 freeze suggests a need to rethink the state’s regulatory approach to energy to avoid future such outcomes. Weatherization, demand response, and expanded interstate interconnections are potential solutions Texas should consider to avoid generation losses, reduce demand, and tap neighboring states’ capacity.

## Researchers were able to re-create a bird's song by reading only its brain activity, reproducing a songbird's complex vocalizations down to the pitch, volume and timbre of the original. The study is a first step towards developing vocal prostheses for humans who have lost the ability to speak.

## A new study led by the University of Oxford has found that previous infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, does not necessarily protect you long-term from COVID-19, particularly against new Variants of Concern.

> Of course it is great to continue studying the basic immunology of Covid-19 and it's variants, but let's stay scientific about the actual results of this study.
> 
> 1. There is no actual evaluation of patient immune responses post-Covid or post-vaccination. The researchers are looking only at neutralizing antibodies - which are important but do not tell us how the actual patient would respond to re-exposure as they are only one piece of the overall immune response
> 
> 2. "Protect" is not a well defined term and can mean different things to different people. Are you "protected" if you can get reinfected but it will only be the sniffles? I mean, I'm not protected from all of the "common cold" viruses (despite getting one every year) but if prior infection and/or immunization against Covid-19 put it and its variants in the "common cold" category then I'm thrilled regardless of what my neutralizing antibodies show
> 
> It is time we stop conflating reinfection itself with badness and terror. The science needs to evolve such that we make conclusions corresponding to important real-world implications and not some lab biomarker. The study of biomarkers are still needed but please stop straining credibility by extending results beyond what they actually show.

## 20-year study links childhood depression to disrupted adult health and functioning. Depression in childhood is associated with higher levels of adult anxiety and substance use disorders, worse health and social functioning, less financial and educational achievement and increased criminality.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/e-tsl062121.php):

> Now, a study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, published by Elsevier, confirms that depression in childhood or adolescence is associated with higher levels of adult anxiety and substance use disorders, worse health and social functioning, less financial and educational achievement, and increased criminality. Overall, the study affirms the public health burden from childhood depression and depressive symptoms, especially when experienced over longer periods of time. "When we consider the burden of depression on children, their families and school, and look at this from a public health perspective, it becomes clear that we need do a better job alleviating risk factors for childhood depression when possible, having better screening processes to detect childhood depression and to use evidence-based preventions and treatments when we see that a child is at risk for depression or has developed depression," added Lilly Shanahan, PhD, professor in the department of Psychology and at the Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

> I was depressed as a child because of the way I was treated at school. Now I’m medicated for anxiety, I have difficulty with sociability (I have learned how to be sociable, but it isn’t easy and many times I can tell I did something wrong but don’t know what). I do very well in school—managed to do a year of college while collecting EI last fall/winter—but now I don’t see how I’ll be able to pursue more learning as I’m broke and everything is opening up again.

> I’m 39, and childhood depression really did a number on my whole life. That depression was caused by intense bullying. 
> 
> Having structures in place to help kids who are victims—and to prevent these things from happening in the first place—would be amazing for the mental health of the population and save a lot of cash from having to be spent on medical issues.

## Research indicates those high on narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy prefer to mate with people who also score high on these traits, especially for long-term relationships, with some exceptions (e.g., psychopaths prefer one-night-stands, regardless of the other person's personality).

> Investigating the relationships of the Dark Triad. Let us now review Kay's two investigations, which examined the mating preferences of people with Dark Triad personality traits. Third, psychopaths are eager to have one-night stands with those high in any of the Dark Triad personality traits. There were exceptions, of course, such as individuals high in psychopathy being interested in one-night stands regardless of the personality traits of the potential partner.

## Experimental brain implant instantly detects and relieves pain

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/science/brain-implant-instantly-detects-relieves-chronic-pain/):

> Researchers from the New York University School of Medicine have developed a brain implant designed to detect pain sensations in real-time and deliver bursts of pain-relieving stimulation. Now, an interface that can detect pain signals in one part of the brain and immediately respond with stimulation to another part of the brain targeted to relieve that pain has been developed. An electrode array detects and decodes pain signals in the anterior cingulate cortex, while an optogenetic system stimulates pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex to provide pain relief.

## Teens who are overweight or obese may be more likely to develop type 2 diabetes or have a heart attack in their 30s and 40s. They are also more likely to have other health issues down the road, regardless of whether they shed any excess weight during adulthood.

Summary of [original article](https://consumer.healthday.com/6-21-obesity-in-teens-raises-adult-diabetes-risk-even-after-weight-loss-2653402308.html):

> MONDAY, June 21, 2021 - In a finding that confirms what many suspect, a new study shows that teens who are overweight or obese may be more likely to develop type 2 diabetes or have a heart attack in their 30s and 40s. These teens are also more likely to have other health issues down the road, regardless of whether they shed any excess weight during adulthood. When compared with teens who had lower BMI-z scores, adolescents with higher scores had a nearly 9% increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, a 0.8% greater risk for having a heart attack in their 30s and 40s, and a 2.6% higher risk for being in overall poorer health, and this held regardless of their adult BMI. The researchers also controlled for other factors known to affect health outcomes, such as race/ethnicity, tobacco and alcohol use. Parents should encourage healthy habits, such as family walks and cooking and shopping for healthy foods together, added Dr. Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness, in Washington, D.C. "When kids do gain weight, take steps in smart and supportive ways to help minimize the weight gain and encourage a healthier lifestyle," said Kahan, who was not involved with the new study.
