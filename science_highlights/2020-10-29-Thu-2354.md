## Scientists analyzed the genomes of 27 ancient dogs to study their origins and connection to ancient humans. Findings suggest that humans' relationship to dogs is more than 11,000-years old and could be more complex than simple companionship.

## Aerosols remained airborne for more than 5 h in a room with low ventilation rate. These rooms should be considered ‘contaminated’ after aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19-infected patients, since it has been shown that airborne SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for at least 3 h.

## One student who had received a negative COVID-19 molecular test result <1 week before a high school retreat led to 116 (76%) cases among attendees. Prearrival quarantine and testing, mask use, and hygiene are critical for reducing the risk for transmission in residential schools and overnight camps.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a4.htm?s_cid=mm6943a4_w):

> On July 3, a ninth-grade student who had received a negative RT-PCR result <1 week earlier experienced sore throat, cough, and chills, and received a positive RT-PCR result on July 5. On July 28, WDHS coordinated RT-PCR testing for 148 of 152 retreat attendees. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result after July 2 in a retreat attendee.

## Scientists engineer new cancer immunotherapy to train immune system in cancer fight

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tmsh-sen102220.php):

> New York, NY - A groundbreaking new type of cancer immunotherapy developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai trains the innate immune system to help it eliminate tumor cells through the use of nanobiologics, tiny materials bioengineered from natural molecules that are paired with a therapeutic component, according to a study published in Cell in October. This process reprograms bone marrow progenitor cells to produce "Trained" innate immune cells that halt the growth of cancer, which is normally able to protect itself from the immune system with the help of other types of cells, called immunosuppressive cells. The Mount Sinai Health System is New York City's largest academic medical system, encompassing eight hospitals, a leading medical school, and a vast network of ambulatory practices throughout the greater New York region.

> **Summary**
> 
> Trained immunity, a functional state of myeloid cells, has been proposed as a compelling immune-oncological target. Its efficient induction requires direct engagement of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. For this purpose, we developed a bone marrow-avid nanobiologic platform designed specifically to induce trained immunity. We established the potent anti-tumor capabilities of our lead candidate MTP10-HDL in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. These anti-tumor effects result from trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis caused by epigenetic rewiring of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow, which overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MTP 10-HDL nanotherapy potentiates checkpoint inhibition in this melanoma model refractory to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Finally, we determined MTP10-HDL’s favorable biodistribution and safety profile in non-human primates. In conclusion, we show that rationally designed nanobiologics can promote trained immunity and elicit a durable anti-tumor response either as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor drugs.
