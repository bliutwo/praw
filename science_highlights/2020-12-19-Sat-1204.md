## How to stop thinking about something - New study used imaging to look at people’s brain activity, see thought patterns, and watch them fade as they are removed. It found that to fully purge a problematic memory that keeps bubbling up, one may need to deliberately focus on it and then push it away.

## Study: Issues aren’t with the farmers or the consumers—it’s with the intermediaries connecting the two. Wholesale traders, particularly the large ones, have outsized influence on food markets and are engaged in a kind of tacit collusion to ensure they collect the biggest profits.

> It's harvest season right now in Australia and there's been a massive problem. Due to covid, the backpacker labour force that the farmers rely on for harvesting isn't here. The farmers can't afford to pay a decent wage, the workers don't want to relocate for a short term job at a low wage, so the fruit and veg is being disposed of instead of harvested and sold. 
> 
> Its easy to blame the farmers. If you can't afford to pay a decent wage and rely on underpaying a travelling itinerant workforce, maybe the problem is on them, right?
> 
> Wrong. The problem is that the major supermarket players have artificially set the cost. They pay so little that the farmers cannot afford to pay their workers more. They own so much of the market and the logistical infrastructure that consumers effectively have no choice but to pay supermarket prices. The problem isn't greedy farmers or cheap consumers, it's the supermarket middle men who fix both prices and profit off the difference.

## Women overestimate men's attraction to thin female fashion models, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/women-overestimate-mens-attraction-to-thin-female-fashion-models-study-finds-58831):

> Both men and women felt that the other sex would be less likely to rate the models as too thin and more likely to find the models attractive than they actually were. The researchers call this a "Parallel misconception", explaining that men overestimated the extent that women would idealize the models' bodies, and women similarly overestimated the extent that men would admire the models' bodies. Beyond telling women that the female bodies portrayed in the media are unrealistic, interventions should focus on helping women recognize that they may be overestimating others' preferences for these "Ideal" bodies.

> > While much of the previous research has had participants evaluate silhouettes of female bodies, study authors Sarah N. Johnson and Renee Engeln wanted to take a different approach. The researchers sought to extend the relevance of these findings by having participants evaluate images of real women in the media.

> It's not that hard to do, and yes, silhouettes remove some confounding variables, but using photos of actual humans is a much better proxy (though still far from perfect) for what humans like in real life.

> Silhouettes aren't even cartoon characters.

## Greatest risk factors of mortality from COVID-19. Men had a 30 % higher risk of dying compared to women of the same age and health status. Hospitalized patients who were obese, had hypertension or poorly managed diabetes had a higher risk of dying compared to those who did not have these conditions

## A person's mental health status can be diagnosed by their eye movements. A machine-learning algorithm was able to analyze data from the eye-movements of cancer patients (n=25) to predict their results on standard tests of mental well-being with an accuracy of 93%+

> n=25 seems *extraordinarily* low for a machine-learning paper. From skimming the relevant part of the paper, it sounds like that's all of the testing *and* training data:
> 
> >To validate the model classification, we used leave-one-supertrial-out (LOSO) cross-validation schemes in this work. This process is repeated in five fold where each fold consists of each one of the five supertrials. The average of all five-fold performance measures in each test set is reported and gives classification results.
> 
> I think that's as well as they could hope to do with this minuscule amount of data, but honestly, I remain rather skeptical. I understand that n=25 can be sufficient to achieve statistical significance in more classical statistical models, but deep learning is well-known to be very sample-inefficient, and their architecture doesn't seem to do anything special/novel that would potentially ameliorate it. 
> 
> I also do get that they are getting a bunch of eye-tracking data from each of the participants, so n=25 doesn't mean they are dealing with 25 input -> output pairs (which would obviously be nowhere close to enough data), but still. I do hope it ends up working out, just not really convinced by the ML work presented here (even dedicated ML papers are extremely prone to spurious results that sound good but fail to be replicated in real-world conditions)

## Arctic squirrels recycle bits of their own bodies to survive winter. By recycling nutrients from their muscles, the squirrels sustain themselves and also avoid a toxic consequence of muscle breakdown. The secrets of the animals’ metabolism during hibernation could someday help human medicine.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-squirrels-recycle-proteins-hibernation-survive-winter):

> Arctic ground squirrels can survive harsh winters with below-freezing temps by holing up for some eight months without eating. From autumn to spring, Arctic ground squirrels hibernate in bouts of deep torpor. By recycling nutrients from their muscles, the squirrels sustain themselves and also avoid a toxic consequence of muscle breakdown, says team member Kelly Drew, a neurochemist also at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

> By recycling nutrients from their muscles, the squirrels sustain themselves and also avoid a toxic consequence of muscle breakdown, says team member Kelly Drew, a neurochemist also at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. During hibernation, nitrogen would otherwise end up in ammonia, which could build up to potentially deadly levels. Instead, the squirrels are able to incorporate that nitrogen into new molecules, she says.

## New Skin Disease in Dolphins Linked to Climate Change. The study comes on the heels of significant outbreaks in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas and Australia in recent years. In all of these locations, a sudden and drastic decrease in salinity in the waters was the common factor

> Scientists at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, CA – the largest marine mammal hospital in the world – and international colleagues have identified a novel skin disease in dolphins that is linked to climate change. The study is a groundbreaking discovery, as it is the first time since the disease first appeared in 2005 that scientists have been able to link a cause to the condition that affects coastal dolphin communities worldwide. Due to the decreased water salinity brought upon by climate change, the dolphins develop patchy and raised skin lesions across their bodies – sometimes covering upwards of 70 percent of their skin.
> 
> The international study, which can be found here, was co-authored by three internationally respected scientists, from California and Australia:
> 
> Dr. Pádraig Duignan, Chief Pathologist at The Marine Mammal Center
> Dr Nahiid Stephens, a veterinary pathologist at Murdoch University (Perth, Australia)
> Dr. Kate Robb, Founding Director, zoologist, and geneticist of the Marine Mammal Foundation (Victoria, Australia) 
> The study, published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed natural sciences journal, provides the first-ever case definition for fresh-water skin disease in bottlenose dolphins. 
> 
> This study comes on the heels of significant outbreaks in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas and Australia in recent years. In all of these locations, a sudden and drastic decrease in salinity in the waters was the common factor. Coastal dolphins are accustomed to seasonal changes in salinity levels in their marine habitat, but they do not live in freshwater. The increasing severity and frequency of storm events like hurricanes and cyclones, particularly if they are preceded by drought conditions, are dumping unusual volumes of rain that turn coastal waters to freshwater. Freshwater conditions can persist for months, particularly after intense storms such as hurricanes Harvey and Katrina. With the increasing climate temperatures, climate scientists have predicted extreme storms like these will occur more frequently and, consequently, will result in more frequent and severe disease outbreaks in dolphins.
