> 7 is the kicker.  In nearly every government plan, whether it be the ACA or emissions, there's always a gain from R&D/technology that isn't well defined.

## A first-of-its-kind study has found that cone snail venom, conotoxin from a species of sea snail, could potentially treat severe malaria, by disrupting the protein-protein interactions of P. falciparum malaria. Emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19 may also benefit from conotoxins as treatment.

Summary of [original article](https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/cone-snail-venom.php):

> Using venom from the Conus nux, a species of sea snail, a first-of-its-kind study from Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine in collaboration with FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science and the Chemical Sciences Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States Department of Commerce, suggests that these conotoxins could potentially treat malaria. Venom peptides from cone snails has the potential to treat countless diseases using blockage therapies. "Conotoxins have been vigorously studied for decades as molecular probes and drug leads targeting the central nervous systems. They also should be explored for novel applications aimed to thwart amiss cellular responses or foil host parasite interactions through their binding with endogenous and exogenous proteins. Further investigation is likely to yield breakthroughs in fields continuously toiling for more efficient therapeutic approaches such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, novel emerging viral diseases as well as malaria where venom-based peptidic natural products can be put into practice."

## Psychopathic individuals exhibit reduced brain activity when taking the perspective of another person who is experiencing fear, finds a new brain imaging study involving incarcerated offenders. This provides neurobiological evidence for the lack of empathy in psychopathy.

> I thought psychopathy was not a defined diagnosis, and as a term is often used interchangeably with sociopathy both of which are very misunderstood due to the precondition for a history of antisocial behavior

## Scientists unearth a consequence of solar panels in the Sahara - Researchers imagine it might be possible to transform the world’s largest desert, the Sahara, into a giant solar farm, capable of meeting four times the world’s current energy demand.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/why-turning-the-sahara-into-a-giant-solar-farm-could-damage-the-global-climate?utm_campaign=fbproliqinverse&utm_content=vrINTI&utm_medium=pro&utm_source=facebook&lsid=g50nziwmq):

> The panels are usually much darker than the ground they cover, so a vast expanse of solar cells will absorb a lot of additional energy and emit it as heat, affecting the climate. Covering 20% of the Sahara with solar farms raises local temperatures in the desert by 1.5°C according to our model. Roughly the same amount of additional rainfall that falls over the Sahara due to the surface-darkening effects of solar panels is lost from the Amazon.

> Make sure you don't interfere with the dust storms that feed the atlantic and carribean.  Fun fact, a lot of ocean depends on nutrients delivered from dust blown off deserts.

## Ancient kauri trees capture last collapse of Earth’s magnetic field

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/ancient-kauri-trees-capture-last-collapse-earth-s-magnetic-field):

> The magnetic orientations of minerals in rock record long-lasting reversals, but can't capture the details of a flip lasting hundreds of years, like the one 42,000 years ago. Spikes in radiocarbon indicated the magnetic field weakened to some 6% of its present day strength by 41,500 years ago. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica that span the past 100,000 years capture stark temperature swings every few thousand years.

> The magnet field does not “collapse.” The poles flip

## Monarch Butterflies Are Nearing Extinction: 5 Ways to Help

Summary of [original article](https://www.gardenista.com/posts/how-help-monarch-butterflies-what-plant/amp/):

> Monarch butterflies have been in the news lately, and unfortunately it's not because thousands of them have made their epic long-distance southern migration to their California coast and Mexico wintering spots. At the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary in Pacific Grove, CA, where typically thousands of western monarchs overwinter, volunteers spotted zero. The Western Monarch Thanksgiving and New Year's Counts and the Western Monarch Milkweed Mapper are two community science programs to join.

> I don't understand. On Wikipedia the species is listed as apparently secure, not even endangered. In what sense are they nearing extinction?

## The white dots in this image are not stars or galaxies. They're black holes. Totalling 25,000 such dots, astronomers have created the most detailed map to date of black holes at low radio frequencies, an achievement that took years and a Europe-sized radio telescope to compile.
