## New research suggests that a strain of coronavirus that has recently alarmed the swine industry may have the potential to spread to humans as well. The coronavirus strain, known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), emerged from bats and has infected swine herds throughout China.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/uonc-scr101320.php):

> The virus' potential threat to people was demonstrated in lab tests showing SADS-CoV efficiently replicated in human airway and intestinal cells. According to Edwards, SADS-CoV shows a higher rate of growth in intestinal cells found in the human gut, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which primarily infects lung cells. "It is impossible to predict if this virus, or a closely related HKU2 bat strain, could emerge and infect human populations. However, the broad host range of SADS-CoV, coupled with an ability to replicate in primary human lung and enteric cells, demonstrates potential risk for future emergence events in human and animal populations."

## The first room-temperature superconductor has finally been found. A compound of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur conducts electricity without resistance below 15° Celsius (59° Fahrenheit) and extremely high pressure.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=r_science):

> Now, scientists have found the first superconductor that operates at room temperature - at least given a fairly chilly room. In 2015, physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, and colleagues squeezed hydrogen and sulfur to create a superconductor at temperatures up to −70° C. A few years later, two groups, one led by Eremets and another involving Hemley and physicist Maddury Somayazulu, studied a high-pressure compound of lanthanum and hydrogen. The two teams found evidence of superconductivity at even higher temperatures of −23° C and −13° C, respectively, and in some samples possibly as high as 7° C. The discovery of a room-temperature superconductor isn't a surprise.

> Edit: Ack, dropped an 'at' in the title. Should be "and at extremely high pressure." But hopefully the meaning is still clear. The fact that we found a superconductor that works at anything close to room temperature is a huge deal, even if the pressure constraint makes it not exactly practical. Huge step toward some kind of practical superconductor, which would be a game-changer.

## COVID-19 in New Zealand and the impact of the national response: a descriptive epidemiological study - New Zealand implemented graduated, risk-informed national COVID-19 suppression measures with initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30225-5/fulltext):

> We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. This descriptive epidemiological study examined a cohort of all confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases and all people tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Zealand up to May 13, 2020, which marked the easing of the most restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions, after which community transmission ceased. Despite these advantages, there was some early undetected community transmission, with the first locally acquired case presenting on March 4 when the national case definition targeted febrile illness, a less frequent feature of COVID-19 in the New Zealand cohort and overseas.

> Summary
> 
> Background
> 
> In early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand implemented graduated, risk-informed national COVID-19 suppression measures aimed at disease elimination. We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures.
> 
> Methods
> 
> We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation.
> 
> Findings
> 
> 1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6–9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8–3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40–3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40–5·30] for 50–64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59–26·31] for people aged ≥80 years compared with 20–34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59–9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14–6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10–4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Māori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups.
> 
> Interpretation
> 
> New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.

## New Study Casts Doubt On The Climate Benefits Of Natural Gas Power Plants | The emissions and methane leaks from new gas plants zero out the CO2 cuts achieved from closing coal plants, a peer-reviewed analysis found.

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f7f74f0c5b664e5babb0ea8?guccounter=1&utm_campaign=Hot+News&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=97281227&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ANffN6pugEC0off0mqQ0lA7foY6dDXXwHW6ufrD_u1s-GJ9BaRBrK-rOGzGwH19NHK9uq5dK8wK3PTwFaBQPMIFbp1w&utm_content=97281227&utm_source=hs_email):

> If the new fleet of gas plants built over the past decade last as long and are used as often as the coal units they replaced, the projected emissions for the U.S. power sector for the lifespan of the stations will decrease by just 12%, a study published last month in the peer-reviewed journal AGU Advances found. The new study marked one of the first major attempts to measure the cumulative lifetime emissions from the U.S. power sector since the fracking boom shifted the majority of electricity production to natural gas. The U.S. would need to shut down many of its gas plants or dramatically reduce how often it uses them to truly meet the emissions cuts promised under the Paris climate accords, the study found.

## Engineers print wearable sensors directly on skin without using heat. The sensors are capable of precisely and continuously capturing temperature, humidity, blood oxygen levels, and heart performance signals.

Summary of [original article](https://news.psu.edu/story/634601/2020/10/09/research/engineers-print-wearable-sensors-directly-skin-without-heat):

> Now, an international team of researchers has taken the evolution one step further by printing sensors directly on human skin without the use of heat. Cheng and his colleagues previously developed flexible printed circuit boards for use in wearable sensors, but printing directly on skin has been hindered by the bonding process for the metallic components in the sensor. By adding a nanoparticle to the mix, the silver particles sinter at a lower temperature of about 212 F. "That can be used to print sensors on clothing and paper, which is useful, but it's still higher than we can stand at skin temperature," Cheng said, who noted that about 104 F could still burn skin tissue.
