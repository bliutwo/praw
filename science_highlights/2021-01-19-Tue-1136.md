> U/InvictusJoker for 'A new study makes it clear: after universal masking was implemented at Mass General Brigham, the rate of COVID-19 infection among health care workers dropped significantly. U/ Shibboleth 's many answers during his COVID-19 community discussions [Link 1] [Link 2] [Link 3]. u/aClimateScientist explains their own research studying the accuracy of climate modeling [Link]. In your experience, what is the best way to pivot from having a large body of evidence to formulating effective public policy? Especially in the city where I live and work, Chicago, health inequity is a pervasive social problem.

## The public’s perception of the harms of magic mushrooms is in line with science - psilocybin-containing mushrooms are relatively safe compared to alcohol, tobacco, heroin, cocaine and other drugs. But this is not in line with drug laws, which put magic mushrooms in the most restrictive categories.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/the-publics-perception-of-the-harms-of-magic-mushrooms-is-in-line-with-science-but-not-with-the-law-59167):

> New research suggests that the public's perception of the potential harms of magic mushrooms is not in line with drug laws. Despite magic mushrooms being a Schedule I substance in the United States and a Class A substance in the United Kingdom - the most restrictive categories - the researchers found that most participants considered magic mushrooms to be relatively safe compared to the other substances. "This suggests a general perception of harm of magic mushrooms that is in line with data on actual harm and the scientifically recognized relative harms of psilocybin mushrooms compared to other drugs. This indicates that public health messaging based on scientific evidence about relative harms of drugs are seen as more credible information sources than government legal drugs classification systems."

## People who voted for Donald Trump and feel warmly towards him tend to score higher on a measure of egocentric victimhood, according to new research. Those who exhibit heightened levels of systemic victimhood, in contrast, tend to be more hostile towards Trump.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/egocentric-victimhood-is-linked-to-support-for-trump-study-finds-59172):

> Armaly and Enders observed that increased egocentric victimhood was associated with increased support for Trump, while increased systemic victimhood was associated with reduced support for Trump. Egocentric victimhood was associated with reduced support for government aid for Black Americans and increased opposition to political correctness, while the opposite relationships were found for systematic victimhood. "While our study measures egocentric and systemic victimhood, we suspect there are other manifestations of victimhood. One that comes to mind is a projective, other-oriented variant, where individuals assess whether another's victimhood claim is worthy of merit or eclipses their own. Although we expect that few individuals enjoy consciously identifying as a victim, they may still unconsciously feel like victims," Armaly and Enders told PsyPost.

> Uh, could someone explain the difference between egocentric victimhood and systemic victimhood?

## Kids who see their parents bicker during a separation or divorce are more likely to develop a fear of abandonment, new research warns. Children who reported higher fear of abandonment were more likely to report more mental health problems (bottled-up feelings of distress, anxiety or fear) later.

## Ride-sharing apps (Uber and Lyft) do not reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. Data shows that ridesharing leads to a doubling or more of vehicle mileage due to reduced usage of public transport and the dead-head miles that drivers travel between pick-ups.

`/u/The_God_of_Abraham` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l0o3k0/ridesharing_apps_uber_and_lyft_do_not_reduce/):

> First thought was that this smells like a hit piece on Uber/Lyft. Looked at the author's other papers and sure enough it looks like he's a one-man "consulting firm" that NYC politicians call in to generate research that supports their desire for more taxes, regulations, and control over transit.
