> U/InvictusJoker for 'A new study makes it clear: after universal masking was implemented at Mass General Brigham, the rate of COVID-19 infection among health care workers dropped significantly. U/ Shibboleth 's many answers during his COVID-19 community discussions [Link 1] [Link 2] [Link 3]. u/aClimateScientist explains their own research studying the accuracy of climate modeling [Link]. In your experience, what is the best way to pivot from having a large body of evidence to formulating effective public policy? Especially in the city where I live and work, Chicago, health inequity is a pervasive social problem.

## Domestic violence surged by 23% during initial coronavirus lockdowns, driven by an increase in sexual and psychological abuse associated with economic stress, according to a new study from Spain

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/lockdowns-linked-to-23-surge-in-domestic-violence/):

> While the surge in domestic violence is not unique to a single country, Spain was the ideal place to examine the impact of the coronavirus on domestic violence because its lockdown was earlier and stricter than those in other countries, said Arenas-Arroyo. As countries around the world implemented lockdowns in March and April, Arenas-Arroyo said that she read news articles that reported a surge in domestic violence by citing the number of emergency calls. Domestic violence calls to police are poor indicators of domestic violence, said Arenas-Arroyo, because many cases go unreported entirely.

## New Maps Show Forests Absorb Twice as Much Carbon as They Release Each Year. The continued destruction of the worldâ€™s largest tropical forests - 11.9 million hectares of tropical tree cover was lost in 2019 alone - makes them less powerful carbon sinks.

> Primary forest loss was 2.8% higher in 2019 than the year before and has remained stubbornly high for the last two decades despite efforts to halt deforestation. At least 1.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are associated with 2019 primary forest loss, equivalent to the annual emissions of 400 million cars.

## Those who recover from COVID-19 are protected against the virus for at least six months, and likely much longer. Antibodies produced months after the infection showed increased ability to block SARS-CoV-2, as well as its mutated versions such as the South African variant.

## Korean scientists developed a technique for diagnosing prostate cancer from urine within only 20 minutes with almost 100% accuracy, using AI and a biosensor, without the need for an invasive biopsy. It may be further utilized in the precise diagnoses of other cancers using a urine test.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/nrco-ccb011821.php):

> An approach utilizing a single cancer factor associated with a cancer diagnosis was limited in increasing the diagnosis accuracy to over 90%. However, to overcome this limitation, the team simultaneously utilized different kinds of cancer factors instead of using only one to enhance the diagnostic accuracy innovatively. The team developed an ultrasensitive semiconductor sensor system capable of simultaneously measuring trace amounts of selected four cancer factors in urine for diagnosing prostate cancer. "This research developed a smart biosensor that can rapidly diagnose prostate cancer with almost 100 percent accuracy only through a urine test, and it can be further utilized in the precise diagnoses of other cancers using a urine test," Dr. Lee at the KIST said.

## Smartphone dependency can sabotage romantic relationships, according to new psychology research

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/smartphone-dependency-can-sabotage-romantic-relationships-according-to-new-psychology-research-59332):

> Emerging in the literature is the idea that smartphone dependency is associated with negative outcomes - not smartphone use. As expected, the young adults with higher smartphone dependency reported less affectionate communication and lower satisfaction in their romantic relationships. The researchers emphasize that every type of smartphone use they assessed was linked to increased smartphone dependency.

## Two studies show neonicotinoid insecticides, the most commonly used worldwide, affect the amount of sleep taken by both bumblebees and fruit flies, which may help us understand why insect pollinators are vanishing from the wild.

Summary of [original article](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/january/pesticides-insects.html):

> Dr Kiah Tasman, Teaching Associate in the School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience and lead author of the studies, said: "The neonicotinoids we tested had a big effect on the amount of sleep taken by both flies and bees. If an insect was exposed to a similar amount as it might experience on a farm where the pesticide had been applied, it slept less, and its daily behavioural rhythms were knocked out of synch with the normal 24-hour cycle of day and night." Dr James Hodge, Associate Professor in Neuroscience in the School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience and senior author for the study, added: "Being able to tell time is important for knowing when to be awake and forage, and it looked like these drugged insects were unable to sleep. We know quality sleep is important for insects, just as it is for humans, for their health and forming lasting memories." "Dr Sean Rands, Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences and co-author, explained:"Bees and flies have similar structures in their brains, and this suggests one reason why these drugs are so bad for bees is they stop the bees from sleeping properly and then being able to learn where food is in their environment.

> Very interesting thankyou. Now combine that with a warming climate, irregularities in the flowering of flora, and habitat loss. No wonder they're struggling.
