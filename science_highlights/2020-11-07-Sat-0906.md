> New research indicates that snow cover across the U.S. Northeast is declining as a result of climate change, and that by 2100 as much as 59 percent of the region will not accumulate any snow. The study also found that the transition period from winter to spring - known as the vernal window, or more commonly, mud season - is likely to occur earlier and last longer, with major impacts on rivers and forested ecosystems. "Snow melt is a major event for rivers and forests in the Northeast," Grogan said.

> As somebody who lives in the northeast and is an avid skier/snowboarder, this has been the case for the last decade. We used to have snow covering the ground by now, maybe not a lot, but there would be some level of accumulation.

> By contrast, it was 70 degrees and sunny yesterday, and it’s gonna be that temp all week, not conducive for snow...

## State-mandated stay-at-home orders and public mask mandates coupled with case investigations with contact tracing contributed to an 82% reduction in COVID-19 incidence, 88% reduction in hospitalizations, and 100% reduction in mortality in Delaware during late April–June.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945e1.htm):

> The relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March-June 2020. Because of limited resources and the growing number of cases, contact tracing in Delaware officially began in May when the Delaware National Guard was activated to assist Delaware DPH. In Delaware, contacts were monitored until symptom onset or quarantine completion. SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, hospitalization, and mortality can be reduced with statewide mitigation strategies implemented in tandem with the routine public health interventions of case investigation with contact tracing, and immediate self-isolation of cases and self-quarantine of contacts.

## Scientists design potent human ACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The decoy replicates the spike protein interface and is intrinsically resilient to viral mutation. A single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected hamsters from a lethal COVID-19 challenge.

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/04/science.abe0075):

> To address these challenges, we have developed a computational protein design strategy that enables the rapid and accurate design of hyperstable de novo protein "Decoys" that replicate the protein receptor interface that a virus binds to in order to infect a cell. Inspired by recent developments in the design of de novo structural elements, we built new disembodied de novo secondary structure elements tailored to support the target structural elements in a way that is both compatible with globular folding and stabilize the binding interface. The design of the protein decoys was constrained to fully preserve-intact up to each amino acid's conformation-the target binding interface, so that the de novo proteins can be resilient to viral mutational escape.

> i dont know how known this approach is, but using decoy receptors is an excellent idea! It just skips the whole mutation issue, unless the virus actually adapts to a new receptor or finds a way to distinguish decoy from real ACE2! I wonder if this is also applicable for future treatments, not just as prophylaxis

## A patient who could not move and talk spontaneously for 8 years started to do so again after being administered a sleeping pill. The spectacular but temporary effect was visualized with brain scans, giving researchers a better understanding of this disorder's underlying neurophysiological processes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/rumc-aaa100220.php):

> Van Erp: "Because Richard's situation seemed hopeless, the family and I decided to administer this medication to Richard. Against all expectations, Zolpidem had remarkable effects. After taking the sleep pill, Richard started talking, wanted to call his father, and started recognizing his brothers again. With some help, he could even get up from his wheelchair and walk short distances." Overactive brain Researchers at Amsterdam UMC, including neurosurgeon resident Hisse Arnts, have used brain scans to demonstrate the differences between the two situations. Arnts: "Richard's brain scans show overactivity in certain parts of the brain. This overactivity causes noise and somehow shuts down the 'good brain activity'. We have discovered that administering this sleeping medication can suppress this unwanted brain overactivity, creating space for speech and movement."

## Lancet study finds evidence that the reopening of schools causes COVID transmission rates to surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext):

> We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number, from a broad perspective across 131 countries. We aimed to assess the temporal association between introducing and lifting different NPIs and levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as measured by R, across 131 countries. Our analysis demonstrates that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs was not immediate and that the time required to reach certain levels of effect differed by NPI. This finding provides important evidence to policy makers on when to expect a notable effect from introducing or lifting an NPI. The observed delay of effect could be explained by behavioural inertia, which is supported by the similar immediacy results of NPIs between using R and using Google mobility data.

## The first severe COVID-19 patient successfully treated with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), with disappearance of coronavirus swiftly from the serum, nasal cavity and lungs, and a reduction of inflammatory cytokine levels, leading to a significant clinical improvement.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00374-6):

> While membrane-bound ACE2 may mediate cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a genetically modified soluble form of ACE2, called hrsACE2, may decrease cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 competing for membrane-bound ACE2. APN001 is a hrsACE2 designed by Apeiron Biologics to imitate the human enzyme ACE2. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissues using clinical-grade soluble human ACE2.

## Study: Policy, not tech, spurred Danish dominance in wind energy. The Danish government spent $3.5 Bn on the feed-in tariff program over the study period, and as much as $114 Mn on the replacement certificates. Together, the two programs reduced carbon emissions by 57.4 Mn metric tons of CO2.

Summary of [original article](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/11/policy-not-tech-spurred-danish-dominance-wind-energy):

> "Technological progress alone wouldn't have led to that widespread development of wind energy in Denmark," said Lin Lawell, the Robert Dyson Sesquicentennial Chair in Environmental, Energy and Resource Economics. "Understanding the factors that influence individual decisions to invest in wind energy and how different policies can affect the timing of these decisions is important for policies both in countries that already have mature wind industries," the researchers wrote, "As well as in regions of the world that are earlier in the process of increasing renewable electricity generation." "Our application to the Danish wind industry," they wrote, "Has important implications for the design of renewable energy policies worldwide."

> Monozygotic are *all identical* multiples.
