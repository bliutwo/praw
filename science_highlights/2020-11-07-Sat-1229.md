## Declining Snow Cover in U.S. Northeast Will Have Major Impacts on Rivers. New research indicates that snow cover across the U.S. Northeast is declining as a result of climate change, and that by 2100 as much as 59 percent of the region will not accumulate any snow

> As somebody who lives in the northeast and is an avid skier/snowboarder, this has been the case for the last decade. We used to have snow covering the ground by now, maybe not a lot, but there would be some level of accumulation.
> 
> By contrast, it was 70 degrees and sunny yesterday, and it’s gonna be that temp all week, not conducive for snow...

## State-mandated stay-at-home orders and public mask mandates coupled with case investigations with contact tracing contributed to an 82% reduction in COVID-19 incidence, 88% reduction in hospitalizations, and 100% reduction in mortality in Delaware during late April–June.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945e1.htm):

> The relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March-June 2020. Because of limited resources and the growing number of cases, contact tracing in Delaware officially began in May when the Delaware National Guard was activated to assist Delaware DPH. In Delaware, contacts were monitored until symptom onset or quarantine completion. SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, hospitalization, and mortality can be reduced with statewide mitigation strategies implemented in tandem with the routine public health interventions of case investigation with contact tracing, and immediate self-isolation of cases and self-quarantine of contacts.

> Nice. I almost forgot what good stats look like when it comes to Covid. Way to go, Delaware!

## Scientists design potent human ACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The decoy replicates the spike protein interface and is intrinsically resilient to viral mutation. A single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected hamsters from a lethal COVID-19 challenge.

> i dont know how known this approach is, but using decoy receptors is an excellent idea! It just skips the whole mutation issue, unless the virus actually adapts to a new receptor or finds a way to distinguish decoy from real ACE2! I wonder if this is also applicable for future treatments, not just as prophylaxis

## A patient who could not move and talk spontaneously for 8 years started to do so again after being administered a sleeping pill. The spectacular but temporary effect was visualized with brain scans, giving researchers a better understanding of this disorder's underlying neurophysiological processes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/rumc-aaa100220.php):

> Van Erp: "Because Richard's situation seemed hopeless, the family and I decided to administer this medication to Richard. Against all expectations, Zolpidem had remarkable effects. After taking the sleep pill, Richard started talking, wanted to call his father, and started recognizing his brothers again. With some help, he could even get up from his wheelchair and walk short distances." Overactive brain Researchers at Amsterdam UMC, including neurosurgeon resident Hisse Arnts, have used brain scans to demonstrate the differences between the two situations. Arnts: "Richard's brain scans show overactivity in certain parts of the brain. This overactivity causes noise and somehow shuts down the 'good brain activity'. We have discovered that administering this sleeping medication can suppress this unwanted brain overactivity, creating space for speech and movement."

> This reminds me of the movie Awakenings. I have heard of other stories similar to this and it saddens me that these people can come out of it, but then go back to their internal prison. How horrible.

## Lancet study finds evidence that the reopening of schools causes COVID transmission rates to surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext):

> We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number, from a broad perspective across 131 countries. We aimed to assess the temporal association between introducing and lifting different NPIs and levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as measured by R, across 131 countries. Our analysis demonstrates that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs was not immediate and that the time required to reach certain levels of effect differed by NPI. This finding provides important evidence to policy makers on when to expect a notable effect from introducing or lifting an NPI. The observed delay of effect could be explained by behavioural inertia, which is supported by the similar immediacy results of NPIs between using R and using Google mobility data.

## The first severe COVID-19 patient successfully treated with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), with disappearance of coronavirus swiftly from the serum, nasal cavity and lungs, and a reduction of inflammatory cytokine levels, leading to a significant clinical improvement.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00374-6):

> While membrane-bound ACE2 may mediate cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a genetically modified soluble form of ACE2, called hrsACE2, may decrease cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 competing for membrane-bound ACE2. APN001 is a hrsACE2 designed by Apeiron Biologics to imitate the human enzyme ACE2. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissues using clinical-grade soluble human ACE2.

## Study: Policy, not tech, spurred Danish dominance in wind energy. The Danish government spent $3.5 Bn on the feed-in tariff program over the study period, and as much as $114 Mn on the replacement certificates. Together, the two programs reduced carbon emissions by 57.4 Mn metric tons of CO2.

## New species of Amphibians has just been discovered : Yaksha perettii. For the first time ever, GRS Lab has produced a free documentary on YouTube that shows how a species is discovered.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-amphibian-oldest-known-animal-slingshot-tongue):

> A tiny amphibian that lived 99 million years ago had a secret weapon: A tongue that shot out of its mouth like a bullet to snatch its prey. There was one known albanerpetontid specimen that did have a long, thin bone preserved near its skull, and "I suspected for a long time that they had some sort of ballistic tongue mechanism," she says. The skull fossil clears up a lot of confusion about this amphibian group's lifestyle, Gardner says, but in other ways, albanerpetontids remain as enigmatic as ever.
