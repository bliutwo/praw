## Drinking alcohol blocks the release of norepinephrine, a chemical that promotes attention, when we want to focus on something, in the brain. This may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

> Home  Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention. In a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence. "When we want to focus on something, or when we stand up from a chair and become active, a brain stem nucleus releases a chemical called norepinephrine. Acute exposure to alcohol inhibits this signal in the brain," said senior author Martin Paukert, MD, assistant professor of cellular and integrative physiology at UT Health San Antonio.

## Higher inflammation, as measured by cytokine activity in blood, was related to worse attention control, but five weeks of meditation training improved attention control. The study suggests that the immune system influences cognitive processes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/meditation-practices-enhance-top-down-ability-to-control-attention-study-finds-58723):

> An intensive meditation retreat improved controlled attention among those who had attended for five weeks, according to a new longitudinal, waitlist-controlled study. The researchers observed significantly greater attention to goal-relevant information - in this case the target stimulus - in those who had completed five weeks of meditation training compared to the waitlist control group. The findings indicate that "Meditation retreats focused on controlled meditative practices enhance the 'top-down' ability to control your attention," Shields told PsyPost.

> Interesting.  I was actually wondering this myself.  I’m living with Systemic Sarcoidosis and most of the time I feel we do a pretty good job keeping inflammation down (Diet, Symbicort, Humira, supplements, etc.), but on occasion I have flare ups.  Sometimes bad ones.  Recently I’ve noticed some sluggish cognitive tempo when I’m not doing so great.  Thought maybe it’s because I’m uncomfortable/depressed, but had the thought it could be  neurosarcoidodis.  I’m normally too ADHD to meditate, though having tried several times for unrelated reasons.  This may be another reason to try again.

## How a police contact by middle school leads to different outcomes for Black, white youth. Black youth are more likely than white youth to be treated as “usual suspects” after a first encounter with police, leading to subsequent arrests over time.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/12/03/how-a-police-contact-by-middle-school-leads-to-different-outcomes-for-black-white-youth/):

> "What we know about police contacts and youth generally is that Black youth are more likely to be stopped by police to begin with, and are more likely to have a negative experience when that happens," said first author Annie McGlynn-Wright, a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University who led the study while pursuing her doctorate at the UW. "What we haven't known previously is the long-term effects of police contacts in terms of criminal justice outcomes." When the eighth-grade police contact is taken into account, it shows that early police contact for Black youth was uniquely predictive of being arrested by age 20, but not for white youth. Simply put, Black respondents experiencing police contact by eighth grade have an 11 times greater chance of reporting an arrest by age 20 than Black respondents who did not experience early police contact.

> For Black youth, an encounter with police by eighth grade predicts they will be arrested by young adulthood – but the same is not true for white youth, a new University of Washington study finds.
> 
> Black young adults are 11 times more likely to be arrested by age 20 if they had an initial encounter with law enforcement in their early teens than Black youth who don’t have that first contact.
> 
> In contrast, white young adults with early police contact are not significantly more likely to be arrested later, compared with white peers without that history.
> 
> The study’s authors found that Black youth are more likely than white youth to be treated as “usual suspects” after a first encounter with police, leading to subsequent arrests over time. Even as white young adults report engaging in significantly more illegal behavior, Black young adults face more criminal penalties, the study finds.
> 
> Researchers also said it’s not just the number of stops, but what transpires during a police stop that sets the tone for future interactions with police.

## Promising material can store solar energy. Researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.

> As we move away from fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy to tackle climate change, the need for new ways to capture and store energy becomes increasingly important.
> 
> Lancaster University researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.
> 
> With further development, these kinds of materials could offer exciting potential as a way of capturing solar energy during the summer months, and storing it for use in winter – where less solar energy is available.
> 
> This would prove invaluable for applications such as heating systems in off-grid systems or remote locations, or as an environmentally-friendly supplement to conventional heating in houses and offices. It could potentially also be produced as a thin coating and applied to the surface of buildings, or used on the windscreens of cars where the stored heat could be used to de-ice the glass in freezing winter mornings.
> 
> The material is based on a type of ‘metal-organic framework’ (MOF). These consist of a network of metal ions linked by carbon-based molecules to form 3-D structures. A key property of MOFs is that they are porous, meaning that they can form composite materials by hosting other small molecules within their structures.
> 
> The Lancaster research team set out to discover if a MOF composite, previously prepared by a separate research team at Kyoto University in Japan and known as ‘DMOF1’, can be used to store energy – something not previously researched.

## Shuttering fossil fuel power plants may cost less than expected

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/giot-sff112520.php):

> A generator-level model described in the December 4 issue of the journal Science suggests that most fossil fuel power plants could complete normal lifespans and still close by 2035 because so many facilities are nearing the end of their operational lives. "My work shows that because a lot of U.S. fossil fuel plants are already pretty old, the target of decarbonization by 2035 would not require us to shut most of these plants down earlier than their typical lifespans." "We shouldn't build new fossil fuel power plants that would still be young in 2035, and we need to have explicit plans for closures both to ensure the system keeps working and to limit disruption for host communities," she said.

## Affirmative-action policies in Chicago high schools were a mixed bag. High-achieving students from poorer neighborhoods admitted to Chicago’s elite high schools had lower grades and were less likely to attend a selective college. But these students also reported more positive high school experiences

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/affirmative-action-unintended-consequences-chicago):

> Since we didn't find evidence that they're doing much better with students in terms of academic outcomes, you could think that we should be focused more on investing in climate at all high schools. Chicago Public Schools admitted students based on race from 1980 until 2009-when a United States federal court lifted a consent decree that ordered schools to desegregate. "Since we didn't find evidence that they're doing much better with students in terms of academic outcomes, you could think that we should be focused more on investing in climate at all high schools."

## Biological diversity evokes happiness in people - More bird species in the vicinity increase life satisfaction of Europeans as much as higher income. 14 additional bird species raise the level of life satisfaction at least as much as an extra 124 Euros per month. (n=26,000)

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/gcfi-bde120420.php):

> Species diversity was measured based on the diversity of avian species, as documented in the European breeding bird atlas. Birds are well-suited as indicators of biological diversity, since they are among the most visible elements of the animate nature - particularly in urban areas. "The Global Assessment 2019 by the World Biodiversity Council IPBES and studies of avian species in agricultural landscapes in Europe clearly show that the biological diversity is currently undergoing a dramatic decline. This poses the risk that human well-being will also suffer from an impoverished nature. Nature conservation therefore not only ensures our material basis of life, but it also constitutes an investment in the well-being of us all," adds Methorst in conclusion.
