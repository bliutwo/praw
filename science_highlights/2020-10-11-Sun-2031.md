## The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can live for up to 28 days on surfaces such as mobile phone screens and ATMs — much longer than previously thought — new Australian research has found.

> Ok let’s look at the experimental methods shall we?
> 
> Viable virus isolated after 28 days of:
> 
> ✓ Constant 20°C laboratory climate controlled temperature without any thermal or humidity fluctuations
> 
> ✓ Complete darkness (as “to negate any effects of UV light”)
> 
> ✓ Suspension in “standard ASTM E2197 matrix” as opposed to human mucosal fluids
> 
> Basically, all I’m willing to conclude from this study is the authors found less stringent laboratory conditions (i.e. more varieties of surfaces) to maintain viable viral isolates than previously thought possible.

## 86% of people who tested positive for Covid-19 during lockdown did not have virus symptoms (cough, and/or fever, and/or loss of taste/smell). The study included data from a representative population sample of 36,061 people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/oct/symptoms-covid-19-are-poor-marker-infection):

> The study, which is published today in Clinical Epidemiology, used data from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infection Survey pilot study - a large population based survey looking at the association between Covid-19 symptoms and Covid-19 test results. The study included data from a representative population sample of 36,061 people living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who were tested between 26 April and the 27 June 2020 and provided information of whether they had any symptoms. Of the 115 with a positive result, there were 16 reporting symptoms and in contrast, 99 did not report any specific symptoms on the day of the test.

## Hydroxychloroquine does not counter SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters, but a high dose of favipiravir does

Summary of [original article](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2020/hydroxychloroquine-does-not-counter-sars-cov-2-in-hamsters-but-a-high-dose-of-favipiravir-does):

> Virologists at the Rega Institute have shown that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine does not limit SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus replication in hamsters. A high dose of the anti-flu drug favipiravir, by contrast, has an antiviral effect in the hamsters. The hamsters were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in two ways: by inserting a high dose of virus directly into their noses or by putting a healthy hamster in a cage with an infected hamster.

> I'm on hydro and I wish people understood the serious risks of it. I have to get my eyes checked for nerve damage every 3 months, my blood checked every 6 weeks and my heart every 6 months. It can have serious side effects that come on quickly

## Anosmia (loss of smell) is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. Hospitalized Covid-19 patients with anosmia had a lower adjusted mortality rate and less severe course of the disease. This could be related to a distinct clinical presentation and a different inflammatory response.

> Could this be because anosmia is such a clear indicator of covid that people seek help sooner?

## Findings suggest that continued trends in female educational attainment & access to contraception will hasten declines in fertility & slow population growth. Policy options to adapt to continued low fertility, while sustaining & enhancing female reproductive health, will be crucial in years to come.

> Yes please. We need to stop population growth, which will require a restructuring of a lifestyle built on the concept of endless growth.

> And if you all could get last mile coverage, let alone half decent coverage to small towns, we wouldn't be in this situation.  But here we are.  We MUST have internet in rural areas.  We're creating an underclass of citizens who are without.  If you can't provide it, we'll deal with someone who will.

## For the first time, a tight-knit group of galaxies has been caught in the act of feeding a supermassive black hole—which could help explain a puzzle astronomers have long sought to put together.

> They found the black hole was connected to six nearby galaxies by filaments: feeding tubes for the monster in their midst. This is the first time a tight-knit group of galaxies has been caught in the act of feeding a supermassive black hole, the researchers report today in. The dark matter may have pulled in huge quantities of gas and dust, allowing both the galaxies and the black hole to form.

## Bimodal neuromodulation combining sound and tongue stimulation reduces tinnitus symptoms in a large randomized clinical study

Summary of [original article](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/12/564/eabb2830):

> To investigate this bimodal neuromodulation approach in humans, we evaluated a noninvasive device that delivers sound to the ears and electrical stimulation to the tongue in a randomized, double-blinded, exploratory study that enrolled 326 adults with chronic subjective tinnitus. Therapeutic improvements continued for 12 months after treatment for specific bimodal stimulation settings, which had not previously been demonstrated in a large cohort for a tinnitus intervention. These positive therapeutic and long-term results motivate further clinical trials toward establishing bimodal neuromodulation as a clinically recommended device treatment for tinnitus.

`/u/Slow_to_notice` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/j9csqx/bimodal_neuromodulation_combining_sound_and/):

> Interesting. I'd be curious why the *tongue* was thought of as a means of approach for treatment.
