## Cannabidiol in cannabis does not impair driving, landmark study shows

Summary of [original article](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/12/02/Cannabidiol-CBD-in-cannabis-does-not-impair-driving-landmark-study-shows.html#.X8aT05nLNQw.reddit):

> Cannabis containing mainly CBD did not impair driving while cannabis containing THC, or a THC/CBD mixture, caused mild impairment measured at 40 minutes later but not after four hours. Dr Arkell said: "With cannabis laws changing globally, jurisdictions are grappling with the issue of cannabis-impaired driving. These results provide much needed insights into the magnitude and duration of impairment caused by different types of cannabis and can help to guide road-safety policy not just in Australia but around the world". Studying the effects of cannabis on driving with such precision in a real-world context is incredibly important.

> CBD doesn't impair you, THC does.

## The coronavirus was present in the U.S. weeks earlier than scientists and public health officials previously thought, and before cases in China were publicly identified, according to a new government study published Monday

> Antibodies found in sera collected as early as Dec 13, 2019 suggests the exposure happened at least 2 weeks earlier - 4-5d of incubation then 10d to make antibodies. That puts the first cases in November 2019 - and the article does not mention testing sera collected before Dec 13th, so the first case could have been even earlier.

## A weaker, nonviolent police force could be a sign of a stronger democracy - A new study of a nonviolent encounter with police in Taiwan shows how the weakness of police power can be treated as an index for the strength of democratic values.

## Plants can pass on bad ‘memories’ to offspring, which results in growth and developmental defects, researchers found. Two proteins reset this epigenetic information during sexual reproduction to erase inappropriate ‘memories’ from being passed on to ensure the offspring grows normally.

> It's not exactly plant memory.  But plants know if the soil is fertile or not.  If the soil is fertile, the plant will more likely be female.  If the soil is not fertile, the plant will more likely be male.  The idea being seeds will fall on fertile soil and in poor soil the male pollen will hopefully travel to a more fertile location.

## Individuals have a natural tendency to demean others by believing (falsely) that others people's psychological needs are relatively less important compared to their physical needs. A failure to understand the human minds of others, this offers evidence of a path to the dehumanization of outsiders.

## Using post-mortem tissue samples, scientists showed that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via nerve cells in the olfactory mucosa. For the first time, researchers have been able to produce electron microscope images of intact coronavirus particles inside the olfactory mucosa.

> I suppose it’s no worse than any other way that a virus can get to the brain but to me it seems a little extra horrifying thinking about breathing the virus in and it getting stuck in the mucus in my sinuses and then traveling through nerves into my brain. Every time I take a breath through my nose now, I’m thinking about what could possibly be crawling up to my brain.

## Scientists have developed a way of predicting if patients will develop Alzheimer's disease by analysing their blood. The model based off of these two proteins had an 88 percent success rate in predicting the onset of Alzheimers in the same patients over the course of four years.

> Alzheimer’s terrifies me. I’m currently a caregiver for my mother who is in the moderate stages of Alzheimer’s, and rapidly moving towards advanced. It’s not even the forgetfulness that scares me, or the ‘living in the past’ aspect, it’s the mixing up of different events and stories. My mother mixes up my siblings and I all the time: the latest is her repeatedly saying that I used to throw my vegetables out the window as a child, but that was actually my older sister who’s over 20 years older than I. She combines things that happened yesterday with things that happened 6 years ago, she combines experiences with her first husband with stories about her second husband (my dad). And if I gently try and correct her, she is adamant that her version is the truth. What’s worse are when she occasionally realizes that she *is* actually confusing things; I can see in that moment how troubling it is for her and it hurts to watch every time. 
> 
> Not knowing what your truth is, not knowing what’s real or not, and being trapped in your own mind, is just a horror to me.
> 
> 
> Edit: I wanted to clarify the part about “gently correcting”, since that’s what the majority of comments here have been about. My mother has been emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive my whole life. When she’s confused or mistaken, 99 % of the time I let it be. I know she’s already under great stress and who wants to be corrected all the time? I’m specifically speaking to the occasions where she verbally abuses me based on events/incidents that never happened. It gets bad, and it’s painful. I never argue with her or go into detail about why she’s wrong, I simply say “that didn’t happen” or “that’s not true”, and move on.

## Hydrogen-Powered Heavy Duty Vehicles Could Contribute Significantly To Achieving Climate Goals

Summary of [original article](https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/Hydrogen-heavy-duty-vehicles):

> "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles offer competitive advantages over battery electric vehicles regarding heavy loads, longer driving ranges and shorter fuelling times - making them particularly attractive to the heavy duty vehicle segment" explains lead author Lindsey Weger: "Moreover, transitioning heavy-duty vehicles to green hydrogen could already achieve a deep reduction in emissions - our results indicate a potential of -57 MtCO2eq annually, which translates to about a 7 percent drop in German greenhouse gas emissions for the current conditions". Accordingly, heavy duty vehicles equipped with hydrogen fuel cells are a possibility worth considering on the path to road transport decarbonization. Transitioning only heavy duty vehicles to green hydrogen would already deliver a large reduction in emissions.

> Ive always wondered why hydrogen trains aren't a thing. Makes perfect sense, same with ships. Especially seeing how much filthy black smoke they spew in to the atmosphere.
