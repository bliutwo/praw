## A new Harvard University study found that, in at least 19 states plus Washington, D.C., burning gas now kills more people than coal because of exposure to a deadly type of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that lingers in the air and lodges in lung tissue.

> Industrial hygienist here. PM2.5 is not a specific material but refers to any respirable dust particles under 2.5 microns. You could measure PM2.5 from any dust generating activity, for instance a cinnamon processing factory.

## Efficient manufacturing could slash cement-based greenhouse gas emissions - Brazil's cement industry can halve its CO2 emissions in next 30 years while saving $700 million, according to new analysis. The production of cement is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases on the planet.

## Politicians in the United States tend to use moral language more often when they have less power, according to a new study published in Psychological Science.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/05/members-of-congress-with-less-political-power-make-greater-use-of-moral-language-60657):

> "Moralization is an important part of understanding political communication and partisanship. Language is a source of data that hasn't yet been studied much in moral psychology, despite the fact that it can be a revealing source of people's moral concerns," said Sze-Yuh Nina Wang of the University of Toronto, the lead author of the study. The analysis of congressional speeches, on the other hand, found that the use of most moral language fluctuated based on political power. Politicians tended to use more moral language when their political power diminished and they were in the minority than when their power increased and they were in the majority.

## The number of death penalties imposed increases in US counties with public support for Republican presidential candidates and larger Protestant fundamentalist populations, finds a new study. No direct relationship was found between size of African American populations and reliance on death penalty.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/county-level-analysis-reveals-socioeconomic-relationships-with-death-penalty-are-more-complex-than-previously-thought/):

> Jurisdictional reliance on the death penalty continues to be shaped by broad socioeconomic factors, but the relationship between these factors and the use of the death penalty are more complex than suggested by previous state-level analyses, according to a new study that utilized sweeping county-level data. Instead, prior research focused on social, political and economic relationships vis-à-vis the death penalty at the state level, but once county-level data was made available by individual researchers and organizations, including the Death Penalty Information Center, Amidon and his colleague, John Eassey of American University, set out to examine potential factors that influence county-level use of the death penalty. The United States' national reliance on the death penalty has shifted from a late 20th-century peak of 330 death sentences in 1994 to 32 death sentences in 2016, according to the study.

## Teens, tech and mental health: Oxford study finds no link - There remains "little association" between technology use and mental-health problems, a study of more than 430,000 10 to 15-year-olds suggests.

> Tech - playing video games for long hours, watching TV for long hours - that would make sense for this article.

## For adult smokers who are uninterested or unwilling to stop smoking, a new study adds to a growing body research demonstrating next generation products such as vapes offer a potentially reduced harm alternative if adult smokers choose to transition to these products.

Summary of [original article](https://imperialbrandsscience.com/timeline/repeated-exposure-to-vape-aerosol-causes-minimal-damage-in-human-lung-tissue-lab-model-compared-to-cigarette-smoke/):

> 5 May, 2021, Bristol - In one of the most advanced applications of in-vitro 3D human lung models in vape research to date, a new peer-reviewed Imperial Brands study shows that, unlike combustible cigarette smoke, blu aerosol had little to no impact on numerous toxicological endpoints under the conditions of test using laboratory models. Published in the journal Current Research in Toxicology, the experiments compared the toxicological responses of an in vitro 3D lung model after repeated exposure to undiluted whole blu aerosol or diluted whole cigarette smoke over a 28-day period. The use of a 3D lung model and extending the exposure scenario produced a more clinically relevant setup than previous applications, because the repeated exposure model is a closer representation of how the human lung is exposed to aerosol or smoke.

## New research indicates that astrocytes, star-shaped cells that support the function of neurons in the brain, play a key role in depression. The findings, published in Frontiers in Psychiatry, indicate that depression is associated with reduced astrocyte densities in several important brain regions.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/05/new-study-of-human-brain-tissue-suggests-clinical-depression-reduces-the-quantity-of-astrocyte-cells-in-key-regions-60668):

> New research indicates that astrocytes, star-shaped cells that support the function of neurons in the brain, play a key role in depression. The study also indicates "That depression commonly reduces the quantity of astrocytes in many human brain regions, without changing the structure of these cells." "Our observations are based on protein levels, and so our observations may alternatively mean that astrocytes have very low protein levels in depression which can no longer be detected. However, as these proteins play central roles for astrocyte activity, this would still imply depression majorly impairs astrocyte function throughout the brain," he explained.

## We’ve measured the size of Venus’s planetary core for the first time

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2276218-weve-measured-the-size-of-venuss-planetary-core-for-the-first-time/):

> Venus has a core that is approximately 7000 kilometres in diameter - about the same size as Earth's - according to the first observation-based estimate. It isn't known "If Venus has an inner solid core and an outer liquid core, like Earth, or if it's all solid or all liquid", says Margot. While the estimate is in line with previous models of the core size, having an actual measurable value will allow more accurate studies of Venus in future.

`/u/ReZpawner` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n56pl1/weve_measured_the_size_of_venuss_planetary_core/):

> Shouldn't that be "calculated" and not "measured"? Especially considering the scientists themselves call it a "rough estimate"?
