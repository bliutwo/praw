## Trust in social media linked to heightened susceptibility to COVID-19 conspiracy theories

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/09/trust-in-social-media-linked-to-heightened-susceptibility-to-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-61886):

> Individuals who rely heavily on social media for news, and who trust social media as a source of information, are particularly susceptible to conspiracy theories, according to new research published in the journal Public Understanding of Science. The spread of such misinformation has put pressure on social media platforms like Facebook, and researchers were interested in learning more about the pathway from social media news consumption to conspiracy belief formation. In other words, participants who frequently used social media for news and who agreed with the statement "I trust news I find on social media sites" were the most likely to also agree with statements such as "The COVID-2019 is a weapon of the biological warfare used by foreign countries." The researchers found that the tendency to identify misinformation did have a protective effect, but only for participants with lower trust in social media.

## New psychology research finds that poor people are perceived as being less susceptible to pain

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/09/new-psychology-research-finds-that-poor-people-are-perceived-as-being-less-susceptible-to-pain-61883):

> Across 10 experiments, with 1,584 participants in total, the researchers consistently found that poor people were perceived as experiencing less pain. The researchers found that individuals with low-paying jobs were viewed as being less sensitive to pain than individuals with high-paying jobs In addition, an imagined individual who was explicitly described as being low in socioeconomic status was perceived as being less sensitive to pain compared to an imagined individual who was high in socioeconomic status. "We found that perceivers judged low-SES people as less sensitive to pain and as requiring less treatment than high-SES people in a lab setting it is still imperative to address how these perceiver biases play out in a clinical setting. Our findings align with medical research suggesting that lower-class patients are undertreated relative to higher-class patients, but we cannot say with absolute certainty that stereotypes of life hardship and pain sensitivity underlie these findings from the medical literature," Summers explained.

> This perception surely enables decision makers and healthcare providers to minimize treatment, avoid treatment, and continue to offer the lowest level of care to those who cannot afford out-of-pocket costs, cannot take time off of minimum-wage work for treatment, or pay for transit to providers for treatment.

## Newly discovered biomarker predicts COVID-19 death days in advance. Research found changes to electrical activity in the heart can help predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients are more likely to decline and die. The biomarker is easily measurable and may predict death several days in advance.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/medical/ekg-heart-electrical-activity-predicts-coronavirus-death-mount-sinai/):

> The researchers claim it can predict whether a patient is likely to die at least two days in advance. A retrospective investigation of health records from 140 COVID-19 patients revealed diminishing QRS waveforms were an indication of a patient declining in 74 percent of cases. The median time to death from the first LoQRS measure in influenza patients was around six days.

> Basically a method of determining heart damage from Covid at an earlier stage than other methods would usually be able to do. That is really helpful for determining the necessary treatment.

## Among thousands of the earliest survivors of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, nearly half had at least one persistent symptom a full year after being released from the hospital. Fatigue, sweating, chest tightness, anxiety and myalgia were most common.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784558):

> Findings In this cohort study of 2433 patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, the most common symptoms at 1 year after discharge were fatigue, sweating, chest tightness, anxiety, and myalgia. This study aimed to determine the long-term health outcomes associated with COVID-19 in a group of patients discharged from 2 designated hospitals of Wuhan one year after discharge. This study found that among patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic, the most common symptoms at 1-year after discharge were fatigue, sweating, chest tightness, anxiety, and myalgia.

> I have the chest tightness and chest pain. Got the damn thing twice, almost exactly a year apart. The hospital gave me an inhaler and my doct has just recently diagnosed me with asthma. Although the asthma isn't nearly as bad as the covid hot flashes. Those are almost unbearable.

> Life post Covid is pretty interesting 0/10 recommend.

## Rethinking what causes pain and how great of a threat it is can provide chronic pain patients with lasting relief and alter brain networks associated with pain processing, according to new research

> As many as one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain, an often intractable problem that costs the country more than $600 billion in treatments and lost work-time and has helped fuel a deadly opioid epidemic.
> 
> But new CU Boulder research, published today in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, provides some of the strongest evidence yet that a non-drug, psychological treatment can provide potent and durable relief.
> 
> The study found that two-thirds of chronic back pain patients who underwent a four-week psychological treatment called Pain Reprocessing Therapy (PRT) were pain-free or nearly pain-free post-treatment. And most maintained relief for one year. They also showed changes in pain-generating brain regions after therapy.
> 
> “For a long time we have thought that chronic pain is due primarily to problems in the body, and most treatments to date have targeted that,” said lead author Yoni Ashar, who conducted the study while earning his PhD in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at CU Boulder. “This treatment is based on the premise that the brain can generate pain in the absence of injury or after an injury has healed, and that people can unlearn that pain. Our study shows it works.”
