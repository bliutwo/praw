>  From the article:
> 
> When there’s a public health crisis or disaster like the coronavirus pandemic, experts know that the official death tally is going to be an undercount by some extent. Some people who die might never have been tested for the disease, for example, and if people die at home without receiving medical care, they might not make it into the confirmed data.
> 
> To address that, researchers often look to what are called excess deaths — the number of deaths overall during a particular period of time compared to how many people die during the stretch in a normal year.
> 
> Now, in the most [updated count to date](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm?s_cid=mm6942e2_w), researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that nearly 300,000 more people in the United States died from late January to early October this year compared the average number of people who died in recent years. Just two-thirds of those deaths were counted as Covid-19 fatalities, highlighting how the official U.S. death count — now standing at about 220,000 — is not fully inclusive.

> Title is slightly misleading - the study suggested CBD may help reduce the inflammation and damage caused by cytokine storms. Also to note, the study was from a simulated response to a synthetic virus dsRNA, but not in any COVID patients.

## Mouthwashes, oral rinses may inactivate human coronaviruses. Several of the nasal and oral rinses had a strong ability to neutralize human coronavirus, which suggests that these products may have the potential to reduce the amount of virus spread by people who are COVID-19-positive

Summary of [original article](https://news.psu.edu/story/635101/2020/10/19/research/mouthwashes-oral-rinses-may-inactivate-human-coronaviruses):

> HERSHEY, Pa. - Certain oral antiseptics and mouthwashes may have the ability to inactivate human coronaviruses, according to a Penn State College of Medicine research study. Craig Meyers, distinguished professor of microbiology and immunology and obstetrics and gynecology, led a group of physicians and scientists who tested several oral and nasopharyngeal rinses in a laboratory setting for their ability to inactivate human coronaviruses, which are similar in structure to SARS-CoV-2. According to Meyers, the results with mouthwashes are promising and add to the findings of a study showing that certain types of oral rinses could inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in similar experimental conditions.

## Each year, millions of Americans fail to appear in court for low-level offenses, & arrest warrants are issued. Text message reminders and a redesigned summons form reduced NYC failure to appear by 13-21% and lead to 30,000 fewer arrest warrants over a 3-year period.

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/10/07/science.abb6591?utm_campaign=SciMag&utm_source=JHubbard&utm_medium=Twitter):

> These interventions reduce failures to appear on average by 13% and 21%, respectively, suggesting that a meaningful proportion of defendants who fail to appear are not intentionally skipping court, but are effectively unaware of court. Our main dependent variable was what participants thought should be done to reduce the failure to appear rate: increase the penalty for failing to show up, send reminders to people about their court dates, or make sure that court dates are easy to notice on the summonses. All participants then answered the following question: What do you think should be done to make sure that other people show up for their court date? Response options were: Increase the penalty for failing to show up; Send reminders to people about their court dates; Make sure that court dates are easy to notice on the tickets/summonses forms issued.

> The court I work at is in the process of implementing text reminders for court appearances. We recently changed how we issue summons at the end of last year to a system that helped another court division improve attendance, but it's impossible to say whether it made a difference for us because Covid hit right before we would start seeing the returns. The data we used to justify spending on a new system had to be compelling, because it was approved even though we're on a very tight budget.
