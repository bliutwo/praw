## Lab grown meat from tissue culture of animal cells is sustainable, using cells without killing livestock, with lower land use and water footprint. Japanese scientists succeeded in culturing chunks of meat, using electrical stimulation to cause muscle cell contraction to mimic the texture of steak.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-021-00090-7):

> A Rate of fibre-shaped bovine muscle tissues capable of contracting in response to applied electrical stimulation, formed with the collagen-based tissues cultured with and without electrical stimulation, and the fibrin-matrigel-based tissues cultured with and without ES. b Temporal variation of contractile distance of the fibre-shaped bovine muscle tissue formed with collagen and Fib-Mat depending on the ES. c Confocal images of the bovine muscle tissue; cell nucleus, α-actinin. In this study, we determined the appropriate culture conditions for constructing contractile bovine muscle tissue and showed that assembly of myocyte-laden hydrogel modules allow formation of millimetre-thick bovine muscle tissue with highly aligned myotubes along the long axis of the tissue. Using our method, the cultured bovine muscle tissue can be easily enlarged by increasing the number of stacked modules, leading to the formation of bovine muscle tissue of standard size for steak meat.

## The conditions of 70% of people with chronic pain have worsened during the pandemic. Job insecurity, worries about the future, the number of people living in the same dwelling, having someone close who has died of COVID-19, or fear of becoming infected may be related with a worsening of the pain

Summary of [original article](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/news/actualitat/2021/048-pain-lockdown.html):

> The pandemic has impacted significantly on people who suffer chronic pain. "When there is a chronic pain problem, it is important that people be able to learn to live with it, focusing on achieving their life goals, with or without pain. It is difficult to eliminate the pain altogether, but it is possible to learn to cope with it and live with it. Biopsychosocial interventions may be useful, in which holistic approaches to pain management are used", explained Rubn Nieto, who is a specialist in understanding, assessing and treating pain problems from a multidimensional viewpoint. In order to improve understanding of the situation of people with chronic pain within the context of the pandemic, the researchers have planned a second part of the study in which in-depth interviews will be performed with people suffering from chronic pain in order to gain first-hand knowledge of their situation.

## The new study shows that the Komodo dragon likely originated in Australia, as predicted by earlier fossil findings.

Summary of [original article](https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/study-reveals-surprising-history-of-world%E2%80%99s-largest-lizard):

> The unusual breeding history of the Earth's largest living lizard - the Komodo dragon - has been laid bare in a new study from The Australian National University. The new study shows despite famously making its home in Indonesia, the Komodo dragon likely originated in Australia, as predicted by earlier fossil findings. "This study proves hybridisation can have a long-lasting effect. In this case it happened millions of years ago, but the signs are still there in the sand monitors. They have more in common with the Komodo dragon than you'd expect," Mr Pavón Vázquez said.

> I wonder if all those stories of a very large lizard from the early Aboriginals was real and a distant relative to Komodo?

My 33 year old healthy younger brother had covid-19 last April and testing months later showed he had scar tissue in his heart from myocarditis. Please do everything you can to avoid this virus. It has the potential to cause real damage even if you’re young and with no co-morbidities.

## Rare 'locked' letter sealed 300 years ago is finally opened virtually

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/opening-sealed-letters-study-scn/index.html):

> "Sometimes the past resists scrutiny. We could simply have cut these letters open, but instead we took the time to study them for their hidden, secret, and inaccessible qualities. We've learned that letters can be a lot more revealing when they are left unopened." In addition to the unopened letters, it contains 2,571 opened letters and fragments that for one reason or another never reached their destination. If the recipient was deceased or rejected the letter, no fees could be collected and the letters weren't delivered.

> Here's a link to the peer-reviewed paper published today: [J. Dambrogio, *et al.*, Unlocking history through automated virtual unfolding of sealed documents imaged by X-ray microtomography, *Nature Communications* **12**, 1184 (2021).](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21326-w)
> 
> >**Abstract:** Computational flattening algorithms have been successfully applied to X-ray microtomography scans of damaged historical documents, but have so far been limited to scrolls, books, and documents with one or two folds. The challenge tackled here is to reconstruct the intricate folds, tucks, and slits of unopened letters secured shut with “letterlocking,” a practice—systematized in this paper—which underpinned global communications security for centuries before modern envelopes. We present a fully automatic computational approach for reconstructing and virtually unfolding volumetric scans of a locked letter with complex internal folding, producing legible images of the letter’s contents and crease pattern while preserving letterlocking evidence. We demonstrate our method on four letterpackets from Renaissance Europe, reading the contents of one unopened letter for the first time. Using the results of virtual unfolding, we situate our findings within a novel letterlocking categorization chart based on our study of 250,000 historical letters.
