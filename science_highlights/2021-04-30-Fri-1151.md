## Researchers examined the guts of freshwater fish preserved in museum collections; they found that fish have been swallowing microplastics since the 1950s and that the concentration of microplastics in their guts has increased over time.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/fm-fhb042921.php):

> To learn how these microplastics have built up over the past century, researchers examined the guts of freshwater fish preserved in museum collections; they found that fish have been swallowing microplastics since the 1950s and that the concentration of microplastics in their guts has increased over time. "For the last 10 or 15 years it's kind of been in the public consciousness that there's a problem with plastic in the water. But really, organisms have probably been exposed to plastic litter since plastic was invented, and we don't know what that historical context looks like," says Tim Hoellein, an associate professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago and the corresponding author of a new study in Ecological Applications. The researchers found that the amount of microplastics present in the fishes' guts rose dramatically over time as more plastic was manufactured and built up in the ecosystem.

> Apparently scientists are having trouble determining the effects of microplastics on humans because they can't find people to use as a control group because pretty much everyone has already started building it up

## US shadow banks, such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund firms, have worsened hardship and inequality during the COVID-19 crisis. Shadow banks are shifting investments in ways that profit on the misfortunes of frontline workers, vulnerable populations, and distressed industries.

## Inmates who are assigned to private prisons (which earn money through a per diem for each occupied bed) rather than public prisons end up serving 90 additional days on average. The mechanism for this appears to be a "greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons."

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20170474):

> This paper examines the impact of private prison contracting by exploiting staggered prison capacity shocks in Mississippi. Motivated by a model based on the typical private prison contract that pays a per diem for each occupied bed, the empirical analysis shows that private prison inmates serve 90 additional days. The delayed release erodes half of the cost savings offered by private contracting and is linked to the greater likelihood of conduct violations in private prisons.

## A new study found that perfectionist thinking patterns contributed to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms, over and above several known control variables.

> A lot of people think it's good thing to have in life but aside from it's correlation with mental health, it's actually crippling and can conversely lead you to burn out on the things you do well and prevent you from attempting things you aren't already naturally good at.

## A billion-year-old fossil found in the Scottish Highlands could be the earliest multicellular animal recorded by science so far.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-56917272):

> A billion-year-old fossil found in the Highlands could be the earliest multicellular animal recorded by science so far. The fossil gives a new insight into the transition of single-celled organisms to complex multicellular animals. "The discovery suggests that the evolution of multicellular animals occurred at least one billion years ago and that early events prior to the evolution of animals may have occurred in freshwater like lakes, rather than the ocean."

## Immigrants act more as job creators than job takers: Researchers found that immigrants not only expand labor supply as workers but also expand labor demand as founders of firms, and do so at much higher rates than their native-born counterparts.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/immigrants-act-more-as-job-creators-than-job-takers/):

> Immigrants in the United States are more likely to create jobs than to take them, according to a new study examining the role of immigrants in entrepreneurship. Existing research has shown that immigrants start businesses at higher rates than native-born individuals do, but this paper expands on that research and finds that immigrants are not simply starting small businesses, but that they are more likely to start more firms of every size. Unlike small and medium-sized businesses with fewer employees, these larger companies are more likely to have multiple founders, so the researchers used multiple definitions of "Immigrant firm" to include anyone on the founding team being an immigrant and the highest-paid founder being an immigrant, as well as a more proportional approach where they looked at the fraction of founders who are immigrants versus not in a particular firm size class.

> I don't doubt that immigrants are more likely to establish new businesses compared to locals: There must be a correlation between risk-taking behaviour & establishing businesses & moving to a new country. 
> 
> Also, a lot of times, immigrants are forced to do so as they don't have contacts in their newly adopted country to get into an established business: It can be easier for me to open up a kebab shop rather than getting back into the marketing business I had been running back in the home country.

## Methane release rapidly increases in the wake of the melting ice sheets.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/utau-mrr042921.php):

> A most recent study in Geology looks even further into the past, some 125 000 years ago, and contributes to the conclusion: Melting of the Arctic ice sheets drives the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor. "In our study, we expand the geological history of past Arctic methane release to the next to last interglacial, the so-called Eemian period. We have found that the similarities between the events of both Holocene and Eemian deglaciation advocate for a common driver for the episodic release of geological methane - the retreat of ice sheets." says researcher Pierre-Antoine Dessandier, who conducted this study as a postdoctoral fellow at CAGE Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate Environment and Climate at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. "The present-day acceleration of Greenlands ice melt is an analogue to our model. We believe that the future release of methane from below and nearby these ice sheets is likely." Says Dessandier.
