## Wise reasoning is a mindset that can foster positive feelings amid interpersonal conflict, that involves recognizing where oneâ€™s knowledge is lacking, acknowledging multiple possible conclusions to a given situation, contemplating the perspectives of others, and seeking compromise.

> I think I do this...but i get very self conscious that I'm babbling and it annoys people. I also get self conscious that people think I'm trying to be smart.
> 
> I feel like people should be inherently uncertain about things which is why I adopted this mindset but it also makes it harder to make decisions sometimes. 
> 
> Like trying to see a spectrum of colours from white, it is difficult to make decisions when you're trying to see everything at once because there are just so many perspectives which are equally valid, it dilutes your understanding of right and wrong and the worst part is not everyone sees it this way so you have an impossible job explaining yourself to some circles, and in unfortunate circumstances some people just think you're being a smartass.
> 
> From personal experience, I think while this "wise reasoning" opens up more perspective, it also makes decision making harder because sometimes when considering everything there is no "right or wrong". Rather, we adopt the philosophy of "it is how it is". So how do you make a decision at that point? Either way, someone loses and someone wins.

## U.S. should look at how other high-income countries regulate health care costs. Standardizing fee-for-service payments and structuring negotiations between insurers and providers could make U.S. health care more affordable, finds new study based on France, Germany and Japan.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/ru-usl112020.php):

> The study, published in the journal Health Affairs, examined how other high-income countries that use a fee-for-service model regulate health care costs. In most countries with universal health insurance, physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis, yet health care prices there are lower than in the U.S. To lower health care spending, American policymakers have focused on eliminating fee-for-service reimbursement, which provides an incentive for performing additional services rather than setting up price negotiations to address the main factor that drives health care spending. According to Gusmano - who is also a member of the Rutgers Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research and Rutgers Global Health Institute - regardless of whether the United States will pursue fundamental policy changes such as Medicare for All or incremental expansion of the Affordable Care Act, both would require that policy makers address health care prices.

## Endometriosis is often accompanied by depression and gut issues. Now scientists better understand why

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-11-23/endometriosis-depression-and-the-gut-have-a-genetic-link/12899378):

> Professor Nyholt says the link between the gut and the other two conditions indicates that dietary interventions might help with more than just stomach issues. "There's actually been some recent observational studies that suggested that you can improve outcomes for endometriosis and gastrointestinal symptoms by following some dietary considerations," he says. They did a three month administration of a low nickel diet and they found significant improvements in endometriosis and gastrointestinal-like symptoms, and a similar finding's been reported for a low FODMAP diet."This indicates that perhaps, particularly in a subset of women that have reported or have some of these gastrointestinal symptoms and endometriosis, that a careful look at their diet may relieve their symptoms.

## Research finds age is no barrier to successful weight loss. There are more than fifty co-morbidities of obesity that can be lessened as we lose weight, including diabetes, psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, osteoarthritis and other mechanical problems

> I love this article! Good news!

> Iâ€™m a therapist and my focus is on PTSD and addiction. Obesity for many of my patients is completely secondary to what the overeating is doing for them. For most folks... the food itself isnâ€™t the problem. Itâ€™s A problem, but not THE problem. Stress? Food. Celebrating? Food. Grieving? Food. Bored? Food. Tired? Food. Angry? Food. In pain? Food. Fighting? Food. Sad? Food. Happy? Food. Lonely? Food. And itâ€™s never reaching for a single serving of something healthy- that doesnâ€™t work. Wanting to avoid people or places or things? Food. Wanting to make unavoidable things bearable? Food. Food consistently, predictably and reliably helps folks regulate and suppress emotions. It doesnâ€™t force people to talk about or feel their emotions. It doesnâ€™t talk back. It doesnâ€™t judge. Itâ€™s rather clever as a coping mechanism. Even if it causes waaaaaay bigger problems. Using food to suppress emotion is a maladaptive coping or survival skill that then fucks up a personâ€™s health, mental health, relationships, life, etc. and can kill them. But the downside to it doesnâ€™t always outweigh what it does to help. For my patients who struggle with this, most know what to do already as far as diet, nutrition and exercise. Their problem isnâ€™t knowledge, itâ€™s the effectiveness of their eating as self-medicating/a survival skill. 
> 
> The people who have the BEST outcomes are the ones that do the trauma work which often goes back to treating childhood trauma and significant and overwhelming feelings of shame, which food works GREAT to suppress... which then causes more shame. What a cycle. These people who so the work to treat their trauma and learn how to reparent themselves can truly learn what it means to be healthy and care for themselves. Itâ€™s hard work and can be undermined by an assortment of things, like other mental health issues, unhealthy family dynamics, codependency, stress, lack of resources, etc. People can and do lose weight, but most people need to recover on the inside too to truly be healthy. ðŸ’œ

## Daily physical touch from a romantic partner enhances well-being, particularly among those with attachment anxiety. Being on the receiving end of touch behaviors offered unique benefits compared to initiating touch.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/daily-physical-touch-from-a-romantic-partner-enhances-well-being-particularly-among-those-with-attachment-anxiety-58592):

> New research suggests that being on the receiving end of intimate touch from a partner improves relational well-being in ways that giving intimate touch may not. Study authors Cheryl L. Carmichael and team were motivated to investigate whether adult attachments styles would be associated with different touch preferences and different responses to touch from a romantic partner. As the researchers expected, being avoidantly attached was linked to providing less daily touch to a romantic partner.

## For the first time, researchers have observed the RNA folding structures of the SARS-CoV2 genome with which the virus controls the infection process. This lays the foundation for targeted development of novel drugs for treating COVID-19 and for future occurrences of infection with new corona viruses

Summary of [original article](https://aktuelles.uni-frankfurt.de/englisch/folding-of-sars-cov2-genome-reveals-drug-targets-and-preparation-for-sars-cov3/):

> For the first time, an international research alliance has observed the RNA folding structures of the SARS-CoV2 genome with which the virus controls the infection process. SARS-CoV2 uses the spatial folding of its RNA hereditary molecule as control element for the production of proteins: predominantly in areas that do not code for the viral proteins, RNA single strands adopt structures with RNA double strand sections and loops. The Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance was founded in 2002 as research infrastructure at Goethe University Frankfurt and has since then received substantial funding from the State of Hessen.

## Study suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has altered Americans attitudes toward inequality and the poor

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/study-suggests-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-altered-americans-attitudes-toward-inequality-and-the-poor-58598):

> Based on their previous research, the authors of the new study had reason to believe that the pandemic might alter attitudes about the poor and inequality. "I think one of the important takeaways from the study is a small silver lining from the pandemic. Our paper showed that the pandemic has exacted some positive shifts in egalitarianism and beliefs about the poor. Throughout the pandemic, our data suggest that there has been some greater awareness in how uncontrollable events can exacerbate poverty. While the pandemic has worsened poverty and inequality, the small silver lining then is that it might also mobilize people who see this damage to help and make change where it counts," Wiwad told PsyPost. "With our modeling of the longitudinal data we were able to show that the pandemic likely caused shifts in both attributions for poverty and support for inequality and government intervention to alleviate poverty and inequality. However, we saw overall attitude change only on attributions for poverty but not support for inequality or government intervention," Wiwad explained.
