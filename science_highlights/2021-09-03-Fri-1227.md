## The extreme cold snap that left millions of people in Texas without power last winter appears to have been made more likely by melting Arctic sea ice thousands of kilometres away, research suggests.

> Canadians have known about polar vortex for several years, although we just get brutally cold weather instead of mildly brutally cold weather.
> 
> tldr version: The bottom is falling out from under the jet stream and is letting arctic air mass spill down to lower latitudes.

## If You Can’t Stand People Fidgeting, You May Have Misokinesia: A new study in Nature Scientific Reports found that 1/3 of people have some level of "misokinesia" or the hatred of movements like leg jiggling, fidgeting, or chewing. It may be related to misophonia—the hatred of certain trigger sounds.

> It makes sense, if you have a higher threshold to search a car that the smaller, more rigorous sample is more likely to yield results.

## Men who catcall claim it’s a “normal way of flirting” — while at the same time demonstrating greater hostile sexism

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/09/men-who-catcall-claim-its-a-normal-way-of-flirting-while-at-the-same-time-demonstrating-greater-hostile-sexism-61805):

> A survey revealed that most men who catcall do so to flirt with women, and many of them hope for a smile from the woman or flirting in return. The researchers carried out a study to explore motivations for catcalling and to identify characteristics that distinguish men who catcall from those who do not. Still, the researchers note that men who catcalled demonstrated greater hostile sexism, higher self-ascribed traditionally conservative masculinity, and greater tolerance of sexual harassment compared to the men who did not.

> I don't know where these guys are learning their flirting skills but no it's not 'normal'. Even 40 years ago it was recognized as being incredibly rude.

## Artificial sweeteners stimulate horizontal transfer of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes through natural transformation

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-021-01095-6):

> Although it is suspected that artificial sweeteners could exert antimicrobial effects, little is known whether artificial sweeteners would also affect horizontal transfer of ARGs via transformation. Together, artificial sweeteners are predicted to continually enhance transformation process in aspects of both frequency and transfer rate, and the combination of four sweeteners would further accelerate transformation dynamics under long-term exposure conditions. Considering that artificial sweeteners are commonly applied in food and beverages and that the consumption of those sweeteners is soaring, the effects of artificial sweeteners on the spread of antibiotic resistance should not be ignored.

`/u/ryjmd` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ph5xks/artificial_sweeteners_stimulate_horizontal/):

> I'm not sure I'm reading correctly because I am a layman. It sounds like artificial sweeteners make it easier for antibiotic resistant bacteria to permeate cell walls so it's easier for antibiotic resistant bacteria to spread?

## Rolling on the ground seems to be essential to life – at least in Africa’s Namib desert, where zebras bathe in dust, creating pits in the landscape that promote biodiversity.

> **Abstract**
> 
> Microsites created by soil-disturbing animals are important landscape elements in arid environments. In the Pre-Namib, dust-bathing behavior of the near-endemic Hartmann's mountain zebra creates unique rolling pits that persist in the landscape. However, the ecohydrological characteristics and the effects of those microsites on the vegetation and on organisms of higher trophic levels are still unknown. In our study, we characterized the soil grain size composition and infiltration properties of rolling pits and reference sites and recorded vegetation and arthropod assemblages during the rainy season of five consecutive years with different amounts of seasonal rainfall. We further used the excess green vegetation index derived from drone imagery to demonstrate the different green up and wilting of pits and references after a rainfall event. In contrast to the surrounding grassland, rolling pits had finer soil with higher nutrient content, collected runoff, showed a higher infiltration, and kept soil moisture longer. Vegetation in the rolling pits was denser, dominated by annual forbs and remained green for longer periods. The denser vegetation resulted in a slightly higher activity density of herbivorous arthropods, which in turn increased the activity density of omnivorous and predatory arthropods. In times of drought, the rolling pits could act as safe sites and refuges for forbs and arthropods. With their rolling pits, Hartmann's mountain zebras act as ecosystem engineers, contributing to the diversity of forb communities and heterogeneity of the landscape in the Pre-Namib.

## The human body compensates for the calories burned during activity, making losing fat progressively more difficult.

> Yes, that's why lifting heavy weights will lose more fat than cardio. 
> Cardio burns the sugar reserve and then it is replenished when you eat. 
> Heavy weight training has to rebuild cells, repair tissue and manufacture mitochondria etc.., a process that takes time , days weeks and requires alot of energy. 
> 
> A hard spining class may take a day or two to recover. A hard heavy weight workout can take a week or two to recover.
