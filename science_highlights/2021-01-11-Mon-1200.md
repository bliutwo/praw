## Cancer cells hibernate like "bears in winter" to survive chemotherapy. All cancer cells may have the capacity to enter states of dormancy as a survival mechanism to avoid destruction from chemotherapy. The mechanism these cells deploy notably resembles one used by hibernating animals.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/medical/cancer-cells-dormant-hibernate-diapause-chemotherapy/):

> One study even found drugs used to treat breast cancer can directly trigger dormancy in some cancer cells. Aaron Schimmer, a scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, describes this mechanism as similar to the way bears hibernate in winter. The study calls these hibernating cancer cells "Drug-tolerant persisters", and the model produced by the researchers suggests all cancer cells have the capacity to become DTPs. O'Brien says this novel insight into how cancer cells evade death from chemotherapy points to exciting new potential cancer treatments designed to inhibit this hibernation-like mechanism.

## Social media plays a role in spreading misinformation and can negatively influence people’s attitudes about vaccine safety and effectiveness, but fact-check tags located immediately below or near a post can play a pivotal role in debunking myths.

## School closures and lockdowns are the only interventions that reduced spread of COVID-19 in U.S. states, study finds. Limiting public events to fewer than 100 people had no effect. No state had an estimated Rt below 1.0 before lockdown, but 29 states reached an Rt below 1.0 after lockdown.

## New research reveals that bacteria have internal clocks that align with the 24-hour cycle of life on Earth. The research answers a long-standing biological question and could have implications for the timing of drug delivery, biotechnology, and how we develop timely solutions for crop protection.

> Humans have them, so do other animals and plants – now research reveals that non-photosynthetic bacteria too have internal daily clocks that align with the 24-hour cycle of life on Earth.

> The research answers a long-standing biological question and could have implications for the timing of drug delivery, biotechnology, and how we develop timely solutions for crop protection.
> 
> Biological clocks or circadian rhythms are exquisite internal timing mechanisms that are widespread across nature enabling living organisms to cope with the major changes that occur from day to night, even across seasons.
> 
> Existing inside cells, these molecular rhythms use external cues such as daylight and temperature to synchronise biological clocks to their environment. It is why we experience the jarring effects of jet lag as our internal clocks are temporarily mismatched before aligning to the new cycle of light and dark at our travel destination.
> 
> A growing body of research in the past two decades has demonstrated the importance of these molecular metronomes to essential processes, for example sleep and cognitive functioning in humans, and water regulation and photosynthesis in plants.

## Using theoretical calculations, an international team of researchers shows that it would not be possible to control a superintelligent AI. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrate that we may not even know when superintelligent machines have arrived.

Summary of [original article](https://www.mpg.de/16231640/0108-bild-computer-scientists-we-wouldn-t-be-able-to-control-superintelligent-machines-149835-x):

> An international team of computer scientists used theoretical calculations to show that it would be fundamentally impossible to control a super-intelligent AI. "A super-intelligent machine that controls the world sounds like science fiction. But there are already machines that perform certain important tasks independently without programmers fully understanding how they learned it. The question therefore arises whether this could at some point become uncontrollable and dangerous for humanity", says study co-author Manuel Cebrian, Leader of the Digital Mobilization Group at the Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development. On one hand, the capabilities of superintelligent AI could be specifically limited, for example, by walling it off from the Internet and all other technical devices so it could have no contact with the outside world - yet this would render the superintelligent AI significantly less powerful, less able to answer humanities quests. The researchers demonstrate that we may not even know when superintelligent machines have arrived, because deciding whether a machine exhibits intelligence superior to humans is in the same realm as the containment problem.
