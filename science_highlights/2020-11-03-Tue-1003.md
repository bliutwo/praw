## The sensation of feeling chills while listening to music was associated with the power of theta waves in the brain's orbitofrontal cortex. The work builds on other studies suggesting that music can also trigger the brain's reward system, even though it doesn't provide a tangible survival benefit.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-music-gives-you-chills):

> In a study released Tuesday, scientists found that specific waves of brain activity increase in power when people get the chills from emotionally moving pieces of music. Music and the brain - Past studies on music and pleasure analyzed neurotransmitters and used fMRI imaging to show that music causes two waves of pleasure in the brain. At the same time, the team found patterns of activity in two other brain regions: the supplementary motor area, a region of the brain involved in motor control, and the right temporal lobe, which is involved in interpreting non-verbal communication, like music.

## Superspreaders are believed to underlie a significant fraction of total COVID-19 transmission. Superspreading, when it is fat-tailed, leads to pronounced transmission by increasing dispersion. Large superspreading events should be the targets of interventions that minimize tail exposure.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/30/2018490117):

> First, the fat tail of Z makes the distribution of Z inconsistent with a negative binomial distribution, and the consistency of the tail with a generalized Pareto distribution suggests that it arises from branching processes in which the time to infection, instead of v, is gamma-distributed; this prediction is consistent with studies that have fitted serial intervals to gamma distributions. Third, fat-tailed distributions generate extreme risk, and superspreading should be mitigated by measures that reduce tail events instead of focusing on the bulk of the distribution. A complementary way in which we may interpret superspreading is by assuming that SSEs arise not only as right-tail samples of Z, but also as the maxima of many samples of the entire distribution of Z. The consistency of this viewpoint with the definition of SSEs as right-tail samples of Z is given by an important theorem in extreme value theory relating threshold exceedances to extreme value distributions.

## MIT Team's Cough Detector Identifies 97% of COVID-19 Cases Even in Asymptomatic People

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-cough-analysis-could-detect-covid-19-even-if-you-re-asymptomatic):

> Now scientists have developed a new artificial intelligence model that can detect the virus from a simple forced cough. Across around 2,500 captured cough recordings of people confirmed to have COVID-19, the AI correctly identified 97.1 percent of them - and 100 percent of the asymptomatic cases. The researchers emphasise that its main value lies in spotting the difference between healthy coughs and unhealthy coughs in asymptomatic people - not in actually diagnosing COVID-19, which a proper test would be required for.

> Great specificity it looks like 97%. But they didn’t test anyone without Covid I’d like to see the sensitivity

## It’s not if, but how people use social media that impacts their well-being. Comparing both offline communication with online, research was able to demonstrate that offline social interaction had precisely the opposite effect of using social media, strongly enhancing emotional well-being.

## US counties that voted Republican over Democrat in the 2016 presidential election exhibited 14% less physical distancing between March and May 2020, with subsequently higher COVID-19 infection and fatality growth rates in pro-Trump counties.

## More than half of all sunlike stars in the Milky Way may have a habitable planet

Summary of [original article](https://www.space.com/habitable-planets-common-sunlike-stars-milky-way?fbclid=IwAR1u0kTiU79rmvtB7LLKiL_cVGHwW_iN4zg0GDJ4EVHcYR4rTPw7GyERAdo):

> On average, each sunlike star in the Milky Way likely harbors between 0.4 and 0.9 rocky planets in its "Habitable zone," the just-right range of orbital distances where liquid water could be stable on a world's surface, researchers have found. The team used this information to estimate occurrence rates for rocky planets in the habitable zones of sunlike stars. The habitable zone is a decidedly squishy concept; whether a planet resides in it depends on the thickness and composition of its atmosphere and the activity level of its host star, among other factors.

## Most Americans find a number of common hospital fundraising practices ethically unacceptable. 83% said they felt that when doctors talk with their patients about donating, it may interfere with the patient-physician relationship.

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/the-pitfalls-of-hospitals-seeking-donations-from-their-rich-patients-147646):

> Examples of these sometimes troubling approaches included providing people who have a track record of making large donations with concierge services such as nicer rooms or doctor's cellphone numbers, screening patients to identify those who are wealthy enough to give lots of money to charity and getting doctors directly involved with fundraising efforts that involve their current or former patients. U.S. hospitals rely on donations to cover some of the cost of providing care for patients, to perform medical research and to educate future health care professionals. The summit brought together a multidisciplinary group that included patients who have made charitable donations to hospitals where they have received medical care, physicians, bioethicists, lawyers, hospital administrators, fundraising professionals, social scientists and representatives of professional associations.

`/u/kakapeeter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jnbc5v/most_americans_find_a_number_of_common_hospital/):

> American hospitals really need fundraisers? At the prices they are charging, I find it ridiculous that they need to do that
