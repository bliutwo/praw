## Massive experiment with StubHub shows why online retailers hide extra fees until you're ready to check out: This lack of transparency is highly profitable. "Once buyers have their sights on an item, letting go of it becomes hard—as scores of studies in behavioral economics have shown." UC Berkeley

> There's a reason that online ticket sellers hit you with those extra fees after you've picked your seats and are ready to click "Buy." A massive field experiment by Berkeley Haas Prof. Steven Tadelis with the online ticket marketplace StubHub concluded that so-called "Drip pricing"-whereby additional fees are only disclosed when customers are ready to confirm their purchases-resulted in people spending about 21% more. They also saw that sellers were more likely to set ticket prices at round numbers-which have been shown to be more appealing to consumers-when they knew that buyers wouldn't see the taxes and fees until the last stage of purchase.

## High school start times conflict with the adolescent 'morning brain': Research monitoring in-school EEG activity found that students are more neurologically alert and able to retain information in mid-day classes (e.g., 10:30am) than in early morning classes (e.g., 8:30am).

> It would probably be healthier for adults too if they didn't have to get up and be to work by 8/8:30am.
> 
> The main reason why school starts stupid early is because work starts stupid early. Like it or not, school has a dual role of education and child care. Our wages have not kept up with inflation which means both parents have to be working just to kind of scrape by. This means that school effectively becomes day care too.
> 
> Until our society changes so that a single income can support at least the smallest of families, parents are going to keep needing someone else to take care of their kids during the day while they're at work.
> 
> And so you can publish study after study that all says the same thing, that early start times are bad for kids, but until we make it so the parents can actually parent, nothing will change.
> 
> Minimum wage HAS to increase, hours worked HAS to decrease. Only then can we think about starting school later in the day.

## Male victims of workplace sexual harassment are viewed less favorably and elicit less sympathy. In addition, male victims were believed to have suffered less and to require less time to recover. Between 16% and 17% of all reported sexual harassment complaints are filed by male victims.

> I find it strange that when Terry Crews shared his stories about facing sexual assault, it didn't raise the issue of sexual assault as a more broad term. Or at least that it opens the possibility that male victims can and does exist. And that most institutions really have no way of dealing with any form of sexual assault, neither with negative attention, disbelief or adequate consequences in the aftermath. Both for male and female victims.

## 1 in 3 adults are depressed or anxious due to COVID-19

> Women, younger adults and individuals of lower socioeconomic status are most affected by COVID-19-related anxiety or depression, a study has found. Factors associated with increased susceptibility to psychological distress among adults in the general population during COVID-19 are not yet well known. For the study, published in PLOS ONE, the researchers performed a meta-analysis of 68 studies conducted during the pandemic, that included 288,830 participants from 19 countries, to assess risk factors associated with anxiety and depression.

## Martian dust storms may glow in the dark. New research suggests that due to Mars' lower air pressure, electrical charges don't build up enough to form long bolts of lightning like on Earth. Instead, martian dust storms might bristle with tiny sparks that make the thick, violent clouds glow purple.

## Scientists Extract and Sequence Million-Year-Old Mammoth DNA: Researchers have successfully analyzed the genomes of three ancient mammoths. The DNA, extracted from fossilized molars excavated in Siberia, is estimated to be 1.2 million-years-old.

Summary of [original article](https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/news/scientists-extract-and-sequence-million-year-old-mammoth-dna-345705):

> The oldest mammoth sample - which the team refer to as the Krestovka mammoth - was morphologically similar to the steppe mammoth. Van der Valk said: "This came as a complete surprise to us. All previous studies have indicated that there was only one species of mammoth in Siberia at that point in time, called the steppe mammoth. But our DNA analyses now show that there were two different genetic lineages, which we here refer to as the Adycha mammoth and the Krestovka mammoth." He added that whilst the team cannot be certain, they think their finding represents two different species. The Adycha mammoth genome was compared to those of the earliest known woolly mammoths, in addition to woolly mammoth genomes that are a few thousand years old.

## Populism is a worldview that pits average citizens against “the elites” and includes anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including scientists). A new study found that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship.

`/u/happy_killbot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/llgnnk/populism_is_a_worldview_that_pits_average/):

> There is such a thing as technocratic populism, which aims to replace politicians with experts and professionals, such as the ANO party (literally means "yes") lead by  Andrej Babiš  which won the 2017 election in the Czech Republic. These types of regimes typically aim to delegitimize the leadership of standard politicians through the pretext of technical expertise on the behalf of the people. For some types of populism, it is not distrust of the experts which enables power, but rather the assumption of its efficacy in governance that enables the rise to power.
