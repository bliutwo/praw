## Entitled people with low humility and low inquisitiveness are more prone to believe in conspiracy theories. These individuals tend to exhibit heightened narcissism and antagonism along with reduced intellectual humility, impulse control, and inquisitiveness.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/entitled-people-with-low-humility-and-low-inquisitiveness-are-more-prone-to-conspiratorial-ideation-59157):

> "Understanding the psychology of conspiratorial ideation is arguably more important now than ever," said study author Shauna Bowes, a graduate student at Emory University. "The personological recipe for the nonclinical individual prone to conspiratorial ideation includes a complex mixture of undue belief certainty, anxiety-proneness, susceptibility to unusual experiences, antagonism, poor impulse control, low humility, and low inquisitiveness. Individuals susceptible to conspiracy belief may find comfort in alternative explanations that blame an outside group of people, and they may not see a need to double-check their faulty intuitions." "A major caveat of our study is that the results are correlational, precluding causal inference. It is still unclear what temporally precedes conspiratorial ideation and what follows from it. For instance, anxious individuals may turn to conspiracy theories to find comfort but conspiracy belief may also increase anxiety. We still need to understand how the pieces come together in a causal framework," Bowes said.

## The American Petroleum Institute (API), the leading oil and gas industry trade group, publicly pushed misleading information on climate change as early as 1980 – much earlier than previously thought – according to newly discovered archival documents.

## The 1966 Fair Labor Standards Act, which raised the minimum wage for several economic sectors, led to a sharp rise in earnings for workers but without any adverse aggregate effect on employment. The minimum wage increases also played a critical role in reducing the racial wage gap in the US.

## Research reveals new insight into why breastfed babies have improved immune systems

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/uob-rrn011421.php):

> In this new study, researchers have for the first time discovered that a specific type of immune cells - called regulatory T cells - expand in the first three weeks of life in breastfed human babies and are nearly twice as abundant as in formula fed babies. The research - supported by the National Institute for Health Research's Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre - showed that specific bacteria, called Veillonella and Gemella, which support the function of regulatory T cells, are more abundant in the gut of breastfed babies. The NIHR: Funds, supports and delivers high quality research that benefits the NHS, public health and social care Engages and involves patients, carers and the public in order to improve the reach, quality and impact of research Attracts, trains and supports the best researchers to tackle the complex health and care challenges of the future Invests in world-class infrastructure and a skilled delivery workforce to translate discoveries into improved treatments and services Partners with other public funders, charities and industry to maximise the value of research to patients and the economyThe NIHR was established in 2006 to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research, and is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.

## Deep-Sea Coral Reefs Found Surviving in Ireland at The Edge of a Submarine Canyon

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/some-corals-in-the-deep-sea-are-thriving-but-scientists-are-worried-that-s-about-to-change):

> I have been studying the cold-water coral habitats off the coast of Ireland for a number of years, and have found these mounds of fossilised coral and sediment are incredibly varied. It's still unclear exactly how these huge mounds of coral deep below the surface of the ocean will respond to these changing conditions, especially since coral lives on such long time scales. Despite their slow-growing nature, colleagues and I have previously found these mounds have exhibited changes over just four years, with increased amounts of coral rubble and significant decreases in the coverage of a particular coral species.

> I highly recommend anyone interested in learning more about coral watch the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral. I legitimately teared up at seeing what's happening to our reefs, and they also talk about deep-sea coral and how they are surviving in the warmer waters around the world.

## In three studies (N = 1,232) examining both behavioral intentions and real behavior, researchers have found that those higher in intellectual humility are more likely to engage in investigative behaviors (e.g., fact-checking, seeking alternative opinions) in response to COVID-19 misinformation.
