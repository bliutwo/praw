> Super interesting. I had a pretty bad upbringing myself, and I’ve learned to be quite compassionate as a result of it. My father was the more compassionate one, not my mother.
> 
> Obviously it just means I’m an outlier, but it’s cool to see a study that basically verifies what many suspect.

## New Zealand’s nationwide ‘lockdown’ to curb the spread of COVID-19 was highly effective. The effective reproductive number of its largest cluster decreased from 7 to 0.2 within the first week of lockdown. Only 19% of virus introductions resulted in more than one additional case.

> No.

> It wasn't luck, and it wasn't the PM. It was NEW ZEALANDERS who eradicated Covid-19. The people created the outcome, led by a government who pushed science and facts to the front centre of the stage.

## Grandiose narcissists often emerge as leaders, but they are no more qualified than non-narcissists, and have negative effects on the entities they lead. Their characteristics (grandiosity, self-confidence, entitlement, and willingness to exploit others) may make them more effective political actors.

## Scientists have created a novel film that is very effective in evaporating sweat from our skin to keep us cool and comfortable when we exercise, and the moisture harvested from human sweat can be used to power wearable electronic devices such as watches, fitness trackers, and more

## In 1956, the US government settled an antitrust lawsuit against Bell whereby the telecom giant could remain a monopoly in telecom but had to make all of its existing patents royalty-free. This led to a substantial increase in innovation but only outside of telecommunications where Bell was dominant.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/innovation-bell-labs-consent-decree):

> The red line shows patent citations for Bell, indicating the number of new patents building on Bell technology. Panel B shows that after the consent decree, Bell patents received significantly more citations than control group patents. The average number of excess citations to Bell patents increased before converging again in 1961-roughly the year when the Bell patents expired.

> So basically it induces an energy shortage as well as increasing reactive oxygen species that are known to be cytotoxic.
> 
> Correct me if wrong but I'm pretty sure that would kill any cell not just cancer cells dawg. Might as well have just said microwaving the cancer cells kills them by turning them into inactive pieces of cooked meat.

## New research published in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal identified RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen collected from a child in Milan, Italy in early December 2019, nearly three months before the first identified COVID-19 disease case in Italy.

Summary of [original article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-4632_article):

> We identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in an oropharyngeal swab specimen collected from a child with suspected measles in early December 2019, ≈3 months before the first identified coronavirus disease case in Italy. The swab specimen, which was collected for measles diagnosis, was not optimal for SARS-CoV-2 detection because it was an oropharyngeal rather than a nasopharyngeal swab specimen and it was collected 14 days after the onset of symptoms, when viral shedding is reduced. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an oropharyngeal swab specimen, Milan, Italy, early December 2019.

> The more of these articles that come out the more I'm convinced that this tore through me, my office and my friend group in January last year. Deathly ill, felt like the worse flu I ever had, that lasted a solid week before starting to get better.
> 
> Would also explain how no one I know has tested positive. Not in my office, not in the 20 or so people I consider my social circle, not my family, no one.
