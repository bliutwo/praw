## 2020 is a 'preview' of how bad things can get if we don't fix climate change, other systemic problems: Lancet report | In 2018 in the U.S. alone, pollution caused more than 68,000 people to die prematurely.

> Vibrio bacteria, which lives off Northeast shores and can cause gastrointestinial distress, skin infections and sometimes death, has increased as climate change has warmed waters and created more ideal salinity for its growth, the report said. According to The Lancet report, where people live and how much money they have directly effects their capacity to resist threats to their health from climate change. "In the US, we see clear evidence of how certain communities are more burdened by pre-existing inequities," Dr. Jeremy Hess, author on both the global report and the U.S. breakout, said in a written statement.

> >The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change is an international research collaboration that monitors and reports annually on the relationship between health and climate, and its implications for national governments. It was launched following the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, which concluded that unmitigated climate change would undermine 50 years of public health gains, but that responding to climate change could represent “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.”

> >Each year, a special companion U.S. brief is released alongside the global report that aims to draw out the most nationally relevant findings to highlight the key threats and opportunities climate change poses for health in the United States. One intended audience for the brief is U.S. policymakers, so it includes a list of policy recommendations that aim to protect human health from the climate crisis. The brief is developed in partnership with the American Public Health Association and a working group of experts in the climate and health field.

## Scientists invent technology that can extract oxygen and fuel from Mars’ salty water in huge step forward to colonising Red Planet

> Humankind's quest to set up base on Mars has received a boost as scientists have now claimed to have discovered a way that can help extract oxygen and fuel from the salty water found on the red planet. "Our Martian brine electrolyser radically changes the logistical calculus of missions to Mars and beyond. This technology is equally useful on Earth where it opens up the oceans as a viable oxygen and fuel source," said Vijay Ramani of Washington University. It is carrying instruments that will use high-temperature electrolysis but the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment will be producing oxygen only, from the carbon dioxide in the air.1./2.Mars rover Curiosity finds evidence of ancient fast-moving streams on surface of red planet.

## Research shows married people enjoy better health, but it has been unclear which came first, marriage or health. A new study finds support for both - marriage is good for your health and encourages healthier behavior, and healthier individuals are also more likely to get married.

## Couples with Supportive Friends, Kin More Likely to Divorce, New research shows that married people who have emotionally supportive friends and family are more likely to divorce

Summary of [original article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/living-single/202012/couples-supportive-friends-kin-more-likely-divorce):

> Married people who had emotional support outside their marriage - they had friends or family they could go to for help or support if they were feeling depressed or confused - were more likely to divorce. She described emotional support as a "Risk" factor for divorce and suggested that "Social ties may sometimes challenge marital relationships or facilitate divorce." She speculated that supportive friends or relatives could increase divorce "By triggering high reliance and obligations outside of the dyad, resulting in insufficient support and resources for the marital relationship." That's a competition hypothesis - having all those nice, supportive friends and relatives means you are not attending enough to your spouse. She did propose an alternative explanation, which I see as more consistent with the positive role that emotionally supportive friends and relatives can play in all of our lives: "Individuals who feel they can count on emotional support from family and friends may be more comfortable ending marriages when they wish to do so, whereas individuals without this support may feel ill-equipped to divorce."

## Declines in blue-collar jobs have left some working-class men frustrated by unmet job expectations and more likely to suffer an early death by suicide. Occupational expectations developed in adolescence serve as a benchmark for perceptions of adult success and, when unmet, pose a risk of self-injury

Summary of [original article](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/01/unmet-job-expectations-linked-to-a-rise-in-suicide-deaths-of-despair/):

> AUSTIN, Texas - Declines in blue-collar jobs may have left some working-class men frustrated by unmet job expectations and more likely to suffer an early death by suicide or drug poisoning, according to a study led by sociologists at The University of Texas at Austin. The study showed that men who expected to work in jobs that did not require a college degree but later faced declines in the job market were nearly three times as likely to suffer early deaths by suicide and drug poisoning as men who sought work that required a bachelor's degree. The study, published in JAMA Network Open, is the first to link the rise in suicide and drug-poisoning deaths among men without a college degree to declines in working-class jobs.
