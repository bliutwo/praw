## Grandiose narcissists' overconfidence, impulsivity, and a willingness to ignore expert advice results in a higher likelihood of making a bad decision. In addition, after getting the wrong answer, grandiose narcissists are more likely to blame others and remain self-confident in their judgment.

## Scientists have discovered a new method that makes it possible to transform electricity into hydrogen or chemical products by solely using microwaves - without cables and without any type of contact with electrodes. It has great potential to store renewable energy and produce both synthetic fuels.

> Two points should be kept in mind to temper your enthusiastic for the significance of this work:
> 
> 1.  Efficiency is a critical metric.  I don't see a mention of it in the press release or abstract, but I would not be surprised if the efficiency was worse than conventional electrolysis.  There would be no interest in large scale application if this if that is the case.
> 
> 2.  Even a perfect 100% efficiency, zero-hardware-cost electricity-to-hydrogen system would do little to change the fundamentals of where and to what extent hydrogen is useful in energy systems.  A key limitation is the efficiency of fuel cells, which makes electric - H2 - electric systems about half the efficiency of batteries.
> 
> Moving forward, world energy systems will use significant hydrogen, and research advances are useful, even if they only improve our understanding and aren't directly applicable beyond the lab.   So I am happy to see this research.

## After Obamacare's 2014 Medicaid Expansion, states that expanded Medicaid gained significantly more access to preventative cardiovascular drugs (for cholesterol, hypertension, etc.). This will likely narrow health disparities by reducing rates of heart attacks, strokes, & death among the poorest.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.007492):

> Methods: We used the publicly available Medicaid Drug Utilization and Current Population Survey to extract filled prescription rates per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries of statins, antihypertensives, P2Y12 inhibitors, and direct oral anticoagulants. Difference-in-differences analyses were performed to compare the association of the Medicaid expansion with per-capita cardiovascular drug prescription rates in expander versus non-expander states. The Medicaid expansion was not associated with higher DOAC prescription rates , P=0.142). Conclusions: The 2014 Medicaid expansion was associated with a significant increase in per-capita utilization of cardiovascular prescription drugs among Medicaid beneficiaries.

> Ok. So as a brit we get these on the NHS.
> 
> But regardless of that, with a prescription its possible to buy a month of atorvestatin and amlodipine (blood pressure and cholesterol) for around $20 a pack. Without subsidy. These are cheap generic drugs.
> 
> Using the state system its fixed at $12 an item. Even if its a $10k drug.

## Black homeowners are twice as likely to lose their homes and transition back to renting than white homeowners. These racial disparities in the loss of homeownership are due in part to Black homeowners having less access to wealth from extended family & higher rates of poverty across family networks.

## President Trump’s use of Twitter diverts crucial media from topics that are potentially harmful to him or that he considers threatening. The pattern is absent in placebo analyses involving other topics that do not present a political risk to the president.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19644-6?T=AU):

> The delay between media coverage and diversionary tweets is assumed to be shorter than the subsequent response of the media to the diversion. In particular, although one interpretation of these estimates is consistent with our hypotheses of media coverage causing diversion and the diversion in turn suppressing media coverage, the available data do not permit an unequivocal interpretation. Our analysis presents empirical evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that President Trump's use of social media leads to systematic diversion, which in turn may suppress media coverage that is potentially harmful to him.

> It's been blatantly obvious for years that he loves to make a loud noise, either on Twitter or by actually doing something in the real world, to distract from bad things coming out about him.

## Hyperventilating touted as possible treatment for alcohol poisoning

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/alcohol-poisoning-hyperventilating-as-treatment-1.5799432):

> Lead researcher Joseph Fisher, a senior scientist at University Health Network's Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, calls the technique a "No-brainer" that doesn't have side effects and involves a very simple mechanical device to assist breathing. Subjects each drank about half a glass of vodka and were able to eliminate alcohol three times faster than through the liver alone, says Fisher. Years ago, Fisher developed similar techniques to address carbon monoxide poisoning and eliminate anesthetics from the body.

`/u/codyd91` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jt4vsu/hyperventilating_touted_as_possible_treatment_for/):

> I like where this is going, but getting a person in the midst of alcohol poisoning to do anything voluntarily is next to impossible. Not sure how you could make someone hyperventilate, but I'm also just some schmuck on reddit who has definitely tried to hyperventilate to sober up.
