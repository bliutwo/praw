## Neuroscience study indicates that LSD “frees” brain activity from anatomical constraints - The psychedelic state induced by LSD appears to weaken the association between anatomical brain structure and functional connectivity, finds new fMRI study.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/neuroscience-study-indicates-that-lsd-frees-brain-activity-from-anatomical-constraints-59458):

> Consciousness is believed to involve the integration of multiple segregated brain networks and their subnetworks, and the researchers sought to better understand how these patterns of brain connectivity varied over time under the influence of LSD. Luppi and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the structural and functional brain connectivity of 15 healthy volunteers during two separate sessions. During the other, they were given an active dose of LSD. Typically, "Neurons that fire together, wire together." But the researchers found that LSD decoupled the relationship between structural and functionally connectivity, indicating that brain activity is "Less constrained than usual by the presence or absence of an underlying anatomical connection" under the influence of the substance. "Studying psychoactive substances offers a unique opportunity for neuroscience: we can study their effects in terms of brain chemistry, but also at the level of brain function and subjective experience," he added.

> This is exactly what I've been saying since I discovered it. The way I describe it is this:
> 
> The connections in your brain that equate to your habits and inclinations are like well worn paths etched in to a field of grass. What LSD does is mow that field of grass so that you are free to explore new paths, so instead of say escapism, or alcoholism, you're free to explore the path of appreciation and self exploration. The paths that you choose on a trip begin to wear in, and if you keep on them for the next week/month/year can become your new modus operandi.
> 
> This is why it can help cure addictions and depression in a single dose. You carve new paths.

## With child discipline, physical punishment or verbal reasoning when parent is loud and abrupt, may lead to aggression, finds global study (n=215,885). Long-term actions by parents (letting children know they are loved, spending time and listening to them) are better than nonviolent discipline.

Summary of [original article](https://news.umich.edu/explaining-to-your-child-why-behavior-is-wrong-may-not-always-work/):

> "Positive discipline doesn't always seem to have all that many positive benefits," said Andrew Grogan-Kaylor, professor of social work and lead author of the study published in the latest issue of International Journal of Behavioral Development. Research has continually shown that spanking leads to negative child outcomes, such as aggression and distraction, regardless of the context in which children are disciplined, including country, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood. "Verbal reasoning may have negative effects on children if it is not employed in a way that is developmentally appropriate for the child to understand why their behavior is inappropriate," Grogan-Kaylor said.

> I hope this generation has it figured out better than the previous numbers. We all were raised by parent(s) who were raised by someone, etc. Dysfunction can pass down through generations, so even when one generation tries to apolgize for their ways as they matured it can take the next to understand this. Some may never but hopefully this generation will rise above.

## Newly licensed autistic drivers crash less than other young drivers - Researchers found that compared with their non-autistic peers, young autistic drivers have lower rates of moving violations and license suspensions, as well as similar to lower crash rates.

## Sudy has identified that certain microorganisms living in the guts of female mice causes them to neglect their offspring. It adds to the growing body of science demonstrating that microbes in the gut are important for brain health and can affect development and behavior.

Summary of [original article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabe6563):

> Together, our results demonstrate that intestinal E. coli strains have differential effects on postnatal growth in the mouse and fall into three categories: strains that have no effect on linear growth and positive effects on weight gain; strains that have a pathogenic effect on linear growth but are sufficient to promote normal weight gain; and strains that have pathogenic effects on both linear growth and weight gain. In conclusion, the growth stunting and impaired milk consumption exhibited by E. coli O16:H48 pups are associated with impaired maternal behavior in E. coli O16:H48 dams. Whether the maternal behavior deficiencies are due to direct effects of E. coli O16:H48 colonization on brain health or a consequence of developmental defects in E. coli O16:H48 mice independent of the growth stunting remains to be determined; however, our results with the cross-fostering studies suggest it may be the latter.

## Most high-seas shark species now threatened with extinction

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/most-high-seas-shark-species-now-threatened-extinction):

> Shark populations in the high seas have fallen by 71% since 1970, researchers have found. In the new study, shark experts took a look at 31 species of oceanic sharks and rays-all of the species that live in the open ocean. The good news is that fishing regulations can help species recover, such as bans on the landing of sharks.

## Slow government response to COVID-19 is linked to higher burnout and lower wellbeing in frontline workers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/slow-government-response-to-covid-19-linked-to-higher-burnout-and-lower-wellbeing-in-frontline-workers-59420):

> It has been widely reported that the UK's relatively slow response into initiating lockdown measures has had an impact on morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and there is now evidence to suggest that this slower response has also had a negative impact on frontline workers' resilience, burnout, and wellbeing. Frontline workers in the UK reported comparatively poorer wellbeing and judged the response of their government less favorably than Ireland-based frontliners. Dr. Elaine Kinsella added: "This study highlights the role of wider social factors on individual-level wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are likely to have relevance for future government and organizational policy-makers who have opportunities to shape the conditions for frontline workers throughout the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and future societal crises."

> Work at a grocery store. First- we can’t wear masks. Then we have to wear masks. No vacation time. No where to go. Everywhere is closed. Several associates are quarantined. We are busier than any holiday. With less help. Burn out is happening on all fronts. Tired of self riotous folks not wearing masks and trying to talk to me.

## Scientists discovered the remains of a fungi-like microfossil that emerged at the end of an ice age some 635 million years ago. The finding provides direct fossil evidence for the colonization of land by fungi and offering a key constraint on fungal terrestrialization.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-20975-1):

> Pyritized filamentous fossils from the ~3235 Ma Sulphur Springs Group27 and the ~1800 Ma Duck Creek Formation28 in Australia, the latter interpreted as sulfur bacteria, are similar to the Doushantuo filaments in terms of filament size and preservation, but these fossil filaments do not branch or fuse; similarly, extant filamentous sulfur bacteria do not develop any branches either29. Late Ediacaran filamentous fossils reported by Zhou et al.30 are associated with karstic dolostone and also appear to have some fungal features such as mycelium-like networks and apparently branching filaments; these fossils warrant further investigation to test whether they represent additional Ediacaran examples of fungus-like micro-organisms in cryptic karstic environments.
