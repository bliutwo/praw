## Gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft and Doordash rely on a model that resembles anti-labor practices employed decades before by the U.S. construction industry, and could lead to similar erosion in earnings for workers, finds a new study.

> Gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft and Doordash rely on a model that resembles anti-labor practices employed decades before by the U.S. construction industry, and could lead to similar erosion in earnings for workers, a researcher found. Mark Erlich, a fellow at Harvard University Law School and a retired carpenters union leader, found in a new paper that the U.S. construction industry's shift from classifying full-time employees to independent contractors laid the groundwork for today's gig economy. Mark Erlich, Wertheim Fellow at the Harvard Labor and Worklife Program, Harvard University Law School was the sole author of the study.

> When are people going to learn, most innovation in businesses these days is "how do I reduce the workforce and get the same work done" or "how do I reduce obligations to the workforce"
> 
> In some cases it is "how do I legally justify merging with this other company to reduce the workforce"
> 
> Sometimes it is "how do I best route my assets to justify not paying taxes"
> 
> Very rarely is "how do I capitalize on this new technology". Mostly if you do want to use a new tech you would let someone else invent it and buy the company for IP or talent depending on the context.

## Researchers in Japan have made the first observations of biological magnetoreception – live, unaltered cells responding to a magnetic field in real time. This discovery is a crucial step in understanding how animals from birds to butterflies navigate using Earth’s magnetic field.

## New study finds that religious coping (e.g. rationalizing your situation by believing that God has a plan for you) closely mirrors the coping strategies that psychologists recommend. This may account for why religious people tend to display reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/uoia-srp010821.php):

> CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - Religious people facing life crises rely on emotion-regulation strategies that psychologists also use, a new study finds. "It appears that religious people are making use of some of the same tools that psychologists have systematically identified as effective in increasing well-being and protecting against distress," said Florin Dolcos, a professor of psychology in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, who led the study with psychology professor Sanda Dolcos and graduate student Kelly Hohl. The study should be of interest to clinical psychologists working with religious clients, Hohl said.

## Partisan scandals harm parties more than politicians. When a politician is implicated in a scandal, it’s the party aligned with the politician that suffers more. This in part explains why the approval rating for the outgoing US President remained steady while his party’s rating plummeted.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/partisan-scandals-harm-parties-more-than-politicians/):

> Its authors outline a new model for so-called partisan scandals in which incomplete information about the supposed scandal leaves voters to infer whether it actually took place, most often resulting in a "Downgraded" perception of both parties while elevating their view of the accused politician. Through these conditions, the authors found that the production of new political scandals is accelerated by heightened stakes - marked by growing polarization, which is defined by increasing gaps in policy priorities between the two parties on subjects such as immigration and taxes. "So you're going to see fewer bipartisan scandals where both parties say something happened ... But you are going to have more scandals overall, because this is going to be driven by partisan scandals."

> While I'm not sure I disagree with the initial statement, I do think there is a lot more going on than just party vs. person perception with regards to Trump.
> 
> The GOP has been taking a beating since 2015.  People outside of it think less of it as a result of Trump's rise (ie; they have a degree of disdain because the GOP let it happen).  People inside it think less of it as a result of the schism that began during the 2016 primary, increased substantially over the last four years and increased hugely since November 6th or so.

## The social class and wealth of your ancestors (even from as far back as 600 years ago) partly determine your current income. There is a "glass floor" that protects descendants of the upper class from falling down the economic ladder.

> Without reading much more than the abstract, I wonder how you get a sample population of people with 600 yr family histories available.  It seems that it would be easier to describe a family history if the family is not mobile.  Families that had emigration would be more difficult to trace.

> Could this introduce a bias?
> 
> Edit: this blew up while I slept.  Lots of replies.  A number of them mention how they have traced their family back 15+ generations.  I would like to ask, does this mean you can name all 32768 of your great^13 grandparents?

## New study finds that the entire auditory pathway encodes sounds based on what we expect to hear. As a result, our subjective beliefs play a vital role in how we perceive reality through our hearing.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/tud-whw010821.php):

> Predictive coding assumes that the brain is constantly generating predictions about how the physical world will look, sound, feel, and smell like in the next instant, and that neurons in charge of processing our senses save resources by representing only the differences between these predictions and the actual physical world. Dr Alejandro Tabas, first author of the publication, states on the findings: "Our subjective beliefs on the physical world have a decisive role on how we perceive reality. Decades of research in neuroscience had already shown that the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that is most developed in humans and apes, scans the sensory world by testing these beliefs against the actual sensory information. We have now shown that this process also dominates the most primitive and evolutionary conserved parts of the brain. All that we perceive might be deeply contaminated by our subjective beliefs on the physical world." These new results open up new ways for neuroscientists studying sensory processing in humans towards the subcortical pathways.

## A new study has identified key genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—that may be responsible for the jump from bats to humans, and established which animals have cellular receptors that allow the virus to enter their cells most effectively.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-identifies-genetic-changes-likely-to-have-enabled-sars-cov-2-to-jump-from-bats-to-humans):

> "This study used a non-infectious, safe platform to probe how spike protein changes affect virus entry into the cells of different wild, livestock and companion animals, something we will need to continue monitoring closely as additional SARS-CoV-2 variants arise in the coming months," said Dr Stephen Graham in the University of Cambridge's Department of Pathology, who was involved in the study. This potentially indicates that similar changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein occurred historically, which may have played a key role in allowing the virus to jump the species barrier. The lack of binding to bat receptors adds weight to the evidence that SARS-CoV-2 likely adapted its spike protein when it jumped from bats into people, possibly via an intermediate host.
