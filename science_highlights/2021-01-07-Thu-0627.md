## US politicians who engage in “negative partisanship”, referring to hostile, nonsubstantive rhetoric about an opposing party or statements emphasizing defeats of partisan opponents, are not rewarded with higher evaluations from citizens. Voters don’t want representation focused around polarization.

## Before the pandemic, one-third of US households with children were already “net worth poor,” lacking enough financial resources to sustain their families for 3 months at a poverty level. Their savings are virtually nil, and they have no financial cushion to provide the basics for their children.

> DURHAM, N.C. - Before the pandemic, one-third of U.S. households with children were already "Net worth poor," lacking enough financial resources to sustain their families for three months at a poverty level, finds new research from Duke University. In 2019, 57 percent of Black families and 50 percent of Latino families with children were poor in terms of net worth. Notably, Black and Latino families were twice as likely to experience net worth poverty than to have poverty-level incomes.

## For young adults in the 18–24-year-old age group, pornography was the most commonly endorsed helpful source about how to have sex, as compared to other possible options such as sexual partners, friends, media, and health care professionals. This was more likely for males and heterosexuals.

A more sinister interpretation is that companies 'take advantage of judicial naiveté to hide some of the most onerous and costly terms in plain sight by using all‐caps.' "

## The lack of respect and open-mindedness in political discussions may be due to affective polarization, the belief those with opposing views are immoral or unintelligent. Intellectual humility, the willingness to change beliefs when presented with evidence, was linked to lower affective polarization.

## Human Fetuses Can Contract SARS-CoV-2, but It’s Rare. Compared with Zika and cytomegalovirus, the virus that causes COVID-19 appears to have a harder time penetrating the placenta and moving to a woman’s unborn baby.

> Not only did that case study demonstrate that a pregnant mom could in fact pass the virus on to her unborn child, it also highlighted concerns that such transmission could have devastating consequences for the baby, says Roberto Romero, the chief maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Detroit-based Perinatology Research Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The current data indicate that infected moms-to-be pass the virus to their babies relatively infrequently, perhaps only in about 1 percent of pregnant women who contract COVID-19, though some estimates are as high as 30 percent. The data suggest that the virus can pass through the placenta and into the fetal blood, but this type of viral transmission is rare.

## CRISPR-based genetic screening identifies KAT7 as a gene that drives aging in both premature aging and normal aging, with subsequent gene therapy extending healthspan and lifespan in both mice models

> > Understanding the genetic and epigenetic bases of cellular senescence is instrumental in developing interventions to slow aging. We performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9–based screens using two types of human mesenchymal precursor cells (hMPCs) exhibiting accelerated senescence. The hMPCs were derived from human embryonic stem cells carrying the pathogenic mutations that cause the accelerated aging diseases Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Genes whose deficiency alleviated cellular senescence were identified, including KAT7, a histone acetyltransferase, which ranked as a top hit in both progeroid hMPC models. Inactivation of KAT7 decreased histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation, repressed p15INK4b transcription, and alleviated hMPC senescence. Moreover, lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9/sg-Kat7, given intravenously, alleviated hepatocyte senescence and liver aging and extended life span in physiologically aged mice as well as progeroid Zmpste24−/− mice that exhibit a premature aging phenotype. CRISPR-Cas9–based genetic screening is a robust method for systematically uncovering senescence genes such as KAT7, which may represent a therapeutic target for developing aging interventions.
> 
> - The KAT7 gene appears to drive cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, in both premature and normal aging in mice
> 
> - Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria are two types of genetic diseases that result in accelerated aging, which has systemic consequences that affect various organs/tissues to cause heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis etc, as well as a tragically shortened life. In Hutchinson-Gilford, a more severe form of progeria, many children suffer heart attacks and strokes before age 10, with a [life expectancy of only 13 years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7481268/).
> 
> - Removing the senscent cells that accumulate with aging (as related to cellular senescence), by using senolytic drugs/therapies have previously been shown to extend healthspan and lifespan in normally aged mice (see:[ Mayo Clinic mice](https://imgur.com/gallery/TOrsQ1Y))
> 
> - This paper adds further evidence to cellular senescence being an important hallmark of aging, and has identified another mechanism related to this hallmark (KAT7 gene) that may potentially be targeted via gene therapy or drugs
> 
> - Identifying causes of aging is important as aging is [by far #1 risk factor for our most prevalent diseases, including cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, stroke etc.](https://imgur.com/gallery/xZQi2dr), and contributes to the increased vulnerability to disease such as seen with Covid-19
