## The first severe COVID-19 patient successfully treated with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), with disappearance of coronavirus swiftly from the serum, nasal cavity and lungs, and a reduction of inflammatory cytokine levels, leading to a significant clinical improvement.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00374-6):

> While membrane-bound ACE2 may mediate cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a genetically modified soluble form of ACE2, called hrsACE2, may decrease cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 competing for membrane-bound ACE2. APN001 is a hrsACE2 designed by Apeiron Biologics to imitate the human enzyme ACE2. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissues using clinical-grade soluble human ACE2.

## The "natural experiment" caused by the shutdown of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 2-h shift in the sleep of developing adolescents, longer sleep duration, improved sleep quality, and less daytime sleepiness compared to those experienced under the regular school-time schedule

## In areas with extensive local news coverage, locals become more knowledgeable about their governor and U.S. senator, and do more split-ticket voting. The decline of traditional sources of local news appears to be a key driver behind the “nationalization” of local elections.

> how do we bring back real local news? it seems like people are so hyper focused on national issues these days that regional issues are completely ignored, and the internet and TV has made it so that national media is more accessible. it seems like there's a social and political need for it, but no real market.

## Tokyo’s Voluntary Standstill May Have Stopped COVID-19 in its Tracks. People moved less and stayed nearer to home. Social contact could also be computed based on people's spatial proximity. That, too, was substantially reduced, nearly to the 80% reduction level the government had targeted

> I live in Japan.
> 
> This is all just my opinion, so take it as you will.
> 
> Japan's "success" is overrated. There are still hundreds of people coming down with the virus every day. 
> 
> The government was forced into a lockdown by other countries. They were not going to close things down because they wanted the Olympics to go forward. The Prime Minister at the time, Shinzo Abe, and Tokyo Governor, Yuriko Koike, were saying as much until countries started pulling out of the games. Abe and Koike realized they couldn't pull the Olympics off, so they postponed them one year. Very soon after, they started the lockdown.
> 
> Throughout the pandemic, various government officials (including Koike) have tried to jumpstart the Japanese economy with "projects" and "campaigns," which Japanese officials at all levels love. They tried to get the Japanese people to boost the economy so that the government wouldn't have to support people and businesses. From hearing about an acquaintance, a small business owner, I've heard that those small businesses are in trouble.
> 
> All throughout this time, hundreds of people are getting sick every day. It's not on the level of the United States, but way behind places like New Zealand and Korea.
> 
> The thing that balances the government's ineptitude in the character of the Japanese people. On the whole, Japanese people listen to people who know and understand things, think of what would be best for themselves, and do it. So when the lockdown came, people did what they understood was necessary, even when the government was unclear and indecisive. 
> 
> Dealing with disasters is part of Japanese daily life. Earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural disasters happen a lot here, and the people are spectacular in dealing with it. So, when the pandemic hit, people just did what they had to do. Of course, not everyone, which is why there wasn't a complete eradication of the virus here.
> 
> I'm really worried about this winter. The flu is always a big problem here, and a virus with no vaccine can spread though communities in no time. The government is going to drag their collective feet to "protect the economy" and again it will be up to the people to battle the virus while the higher-ups encourage people to "go to travel" again.

## Lancet study finds evidence that the reopening of schools causes COVID transmission rates to surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext):

> We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number, from a broad perspective across 131 countries. We aimed to assess the temporal association between introducing and lifting different NPIs and levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as measured by R, across 131 countries. Our analysis demonstrates that the effect of introducing and lifting NPIs was not immediate and that the time required to reach certain levels of effect differed by NPI. This finding provides important evidence to policy makers on when to expect a notable effect from introducing or lifting an NPI. The observed delay of effect could be explained by behavioural inertia, which is supported by the similar immediacy results of NPIs between using R and using Google mobility data.

`/u/hedgehogflamingo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jp9ip1/lancet_study_finds_evidence_that_the_reopening_of/):

> Closer proximity to people, the easier it is to spread a diseases in prolonged exposure due to **asymptomatic** features of Covid. 
> 
> In schools, it's harder to believe in an 'invisible monster' too, and kids definitely don't all understand or take precautions seriously despite their parents' initial instructions about hand washing, touching or sharing of common surfaces. 
> 
> Anecdotally, I also saw middle school kids milling about the playground trying to rub and cough on each other... So previous faulty understanding of Covid may allow belief that a reopening of schools and services may falsely indicate no severity of the disease at all.

## Engineers have developed a computer chip that combines two functions – logic operations and data storage – into a single architecture, paving the way to more efficient devices. Their technology is particularly promising for applications relying on artificial intelligence.

Summary of [original article](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/next-generation-computer-chip-with-two-heads/):

> EPFL engineers have developed a computer chip that combines two functions - logic operations and data storage - into a single architecture, paving the way to more efficient devices. Until now, the energy efficiency of computer chips has been limited by the von Neumann architecture they currently use, where data processing and data storage take place in two separate units. The EPFL chip is made from MoS2, which is a 2D material consisting of a single layer that's only three atoms thick.

## The rate at which children are being admitted to U.S. emergency rooms for sexual abuse almost doubled between 2010 and 2016, new study finds. Researchers believe the rise could be related to increases in human trafficking.

Summary of [original article](https://www.physiciansweekly.com/increasing-emergency-department-admissions/):

> Nationwide emergency department data show that admissions of youngsters under age 18 to EDs for sexual abuse rose from just under six per 100,000 children to nearly 12 per 100,000, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics. The number of emergency department admissions for child sexual abuse rose from 5,138 in 2010 to 8,818 in 2016, which meant that admissions increased from 6.93 per 100,000 children in 2010 to 11.97 per 100,000 in 2016. "They looked for diagnostic codes for child sexual abuse that were confirmed, whereas in practice many patients come to the emergency department with abuse are often coded as suspected rather than confirmed," Lim said.

`/u/lazyblackknight` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jp78lr/the_rate_at_which_children_are_being_admitted_to/):

> I'm curious. Is it because reporting has increased significantly in the last decade or is it just the pure increase in number of cases. I'd love to look at the data and factors that they've considered.
