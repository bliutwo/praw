## Conservatives are more likely to express concern about climate change when framed as a national security concern and communicated by members of the armed services.

Summary of [original article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524032.2020.1799836):

> We devised an environmental communication strategy that attributes pro-climate messages to military service members, aimed at convincing conservative climate skeptics to express elevated concern. In a large survey experiment, we show that conservatives are more likely to express concern about climate change when framed as a national security concern and communicated by members of the armed services. Supplementary analyses of an original military service member survey suggest that this approach is externally valid, as many past and current armed forces express concern about the effects of climate change.

## Sleep loss hijacks brain’s activity during learning. Getting only half a night’s sleep, as many medical workers and military personnel often do, hijacks the brain’s ability to unlearn fear-related memories. It might put people at greater risk of conditions such as anxiety and PTSD

> So, this means missing sleep after a highly stressful/embarrasing/or trauma filled day could lead to those memories failing to suppress and leading to anxiety and/or ptsd?

## A small minority of “superspreader” points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants and religious establishments account for a large majority of COVID-19 infections and restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility.

> This is so common in complex systems where you see a few key factors dominating the outcome (kind of similar to Pareto distributions). Target your efforts there and the results are much more noticeable. Pandemic response has so far been focused on widespread linear-style adjustments whereas a key influencer approach with some kind of power law assumptions would be preferable (in my opinion).

## Physicists have re-created a nuclear reaction that happened between two and three minutes after the Big Bang. Their measurement nails down the most uncertain factor in a sequence of steps known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis that forged the universe’s first atomic nuclei.

Summary of [original article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-pin-down-nuclear-reaction-from-moments-after-the-big-bang-20201111/):

> The precise amount of deuterium that remains reveals key details about those first minutes, including the density of protons and neutrons and how quickly they became separated by cosmic expansion. Adding to the difficulty, cosmic rays that constantly rain down on Earth's surface can mimic the signal produced by deuterium reactions. A longstanding "Fly in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis ointment," according to Fields, is that the matter density calculated from deuterium and the cosmic microwave background predicts that there should be three times more lithium in the universe than we actually observe.

> Ok, can someone eli5 how the hell people come to the conclusion that "x happened y amount of seconds/minutes/hours after the big bang?" Like, with an uncountable amount of matter and energy in the universe, how are we so confident that this happened in this *incredibly* specific timeframe nearly 14 billion years ago?

## Scientists have sequenced and recorded the genomes - the genetic make-up or "code of life" - of species from almost every branch of the bird family tree.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54904806):

> Scientists have sequenced and recorded the genomes - the genetic make-up or "Code of life" - of species from almost every branch of the bird family tree. The project aims eventually to include a genome from every living species of bird. Dr Braun said it was the humble chicken that was the "Model species" for studying some extreme examples of avian evolution - including how giant, flightless birds like the ostrich evolved.

> Wait could we use deep learning with such a map, and create new organisims from the gaps in evolutionary space?

## 68% of the tested mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts had evidence of COVID-19 infection, with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/09/science.abe5901):

> Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. The sequences generated from mink farms and from mink farm employees were compared with the national database consisting of around 1,775 WGS. To discriminate between community acquired infections and mink farm related SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to determine the potential risk for people living close to mink farms, WGS was also performed on 34 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, sampled from 04-03-2020 until 29-04-2020, from individuals who live in the same four-digit postal code area as the first four mink farms. These local sequences, sampled in a proxy of around 19 km2, reflected the general diversity of SARS-CoV-2 seen in the Netherlands and were not related to the clusters of mink sequences found on the mink farms, thereby indicating no spill-over to people living in close proximity to mink farms had occurred and that the sequences from SARS-CoV-2 infected animals and farm workers clustered by farm.

> One of the main reasons this is a huge deal, is that jumping species to species makes mutations much more likely.

> It's possible that once we get a workable vaccine we just see 'mink Covid' or some other new type that spread to another species and then back to humans.  The existing vaccine might work still, it might not.
> 
> But if it can easy jump species then even a worldwide vaccine wont eliminate it.  Because we'd have to not just give it to every person; we'd have to give it to every **mammal**.

## Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab have made transparent glass panes that darken in the sun’s glare and also act as solar panels. At low humidity levels, the window is see-through. But as temperatures rise, the vapor triggers a chemical reaction that causes the window to darken.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19009-z.pdf):

> MHPs are inherently thermochromic materials exhibiting signiﬁcant optical changes induced by crystal phase transitions between the α-phase, a black high-symmetry perovskite phase composed of corner-sharing [MX6]4− octahedra, and the δ-phase, a yellow-to-colorless non-perovskite hexagonal or orthorhombic phase composed of face- or edge-sharing [MX6]4− octahedra, respectively26-28. 2D WAXS data collected during phase evolution shows the grains are polycrystalline and do not become textured over time, and the size of the domains remain constant as the FAn+1PbnI3n+1 domains evolve with increasing RH. After exposure to ﬂowing humid air at 82% RH until the ﬁlm is white/colorless, exposure of ﬂowing dry He reverses the observed phase transformations: the peak of δ-FAPbI3 at 0.838 Å−1 disappears while the peak of α-FAPbI3 at 0.995 Å−1, and the,,, and peaks of FA2PbI4 at 0.703 Å−1, 1.400 Å−1, 2.040 Å−1, and 2.095 Å−1 reemerge. We were not able to measure  values of the white/colorless phase, as the lowest ﬂuences were sufﬁcient to convert this phase into the brown phase via heat-induced dehydration mechanism that we have observed at temperatures as low as 35 °C. ARTICLE Discussion We synthesized layered FA-based MHPs of the general formula FAn+1PbnX3n+1 and their mixed-halide compositions and show reversible multicolor chromism based on two different stimuli: solvent vapor and temperature.
