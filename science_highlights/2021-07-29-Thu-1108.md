## About 74 million lives could be saved this century if humans cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/29/1021247014/cutting-carbon-pollution-quickly-would-save-millions-of-lives-study-finds):

> Reducing Climate Pollution Saves Lives, Study Finds Cutting carbon emissions to zero in the next 30 years would save about 74 million lives this century, a new analysis estimates. "There have been over 100 U.S. government regulations where the social cost of carbon was used," says Maureen Cropper, a climate economist at the University of Maryland, who co-chaired a 2017 National Academies of Sciences committee on the social cost of carbon. At least 11 states also use the social cost of carbon to inform decisions about their power grids, efficiency regulations and other climate policies, Cropper says, and Canada based its own cost number on the original U.S. calculations.

## Einstein was right (again): Astronomers detect light from behind black hole

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-07-29/albert-einstein-astronomers-detect-light-behind-black-hole/100333436):

> Catching hidden lightDr Wilkins and his team were studying these X-ray flares spewing out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy called I Zwicky 1.Using NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope, they saw the expected bright X-ray flashes - but there was also something strange going on. Discovery provides insight into supermassive black holesIn addition to proving Einstein's theory of relativity is right once again, the discovery could also help astronomers better understand supermassive black holes, Dr Cowley said. "The exciting thing about this observation is that it is light bent around a black hole."It tells us what the material around the black hole is doing, at a resolution we couldn't ever hope to achieve with conventional telescopes.

> Einstein didn't think black holes could form so I don't know what that article is on about at the start. Predictions based on his theory are proven right again, not that his theories on black holes are proven right.

## University of Washington at Seattle researchers estimate that 60% of US COVID-19 cases have gone unreported due to biases in test data and delayed reporting, according to study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/us-covid-prevalence-likely-60-higher-reported-experts-say):

> The researchers used multiple data sources, including likely unbiased representative random testing surveys from Indiana and Ohio, to estimate the true number of coronavirus infections in both the country and in each state for 1 year starting in March 2020. "What we wanted to do is to develop a framework that corrects the flaws in multiple data sources and draws on their strengths to give us an idea of COVID-19's prevalence in a region, a state or the country as a whole," he said. About 65 million US residents likely had COVID-19 by Mar 7, the model shows.

> That's consistant with the estimated underreporting a year ago.

## Being reluctant to try new foods can be a turn-off. The new study provides evidence that the willingness to try new food can influence sexual desirability and is seen by others as a signal of sexual unrestrictedness.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/people-who-are-willing-to-try-new-foods-are-perceived-as-more-desirable-and-less-sexually-restricted-61604):

> In three additional studies, in which 323 participants viewed online dating profiles of opposite-sex individuals, Bradshaw and her colleagues found that those willing to try new foods were perceived as having had a greater number of past sexual partners and as being more open to uncommitted sexual relationships. "That is, people view those who are willing to try new foods as more desirable and less sexually restricted than those who are reluctant to try new foods. Essentially, one's willingness to try new food plays a role in the impressions formed by prospective dates and mates." "In the current research, we found that people form these judgements based on explicit information about one's willingness to try new food. Whether or not people form similar judgments based on more subtle cues that may be relayed during conversation is yet to be determined. Moreover, we still don't know whether people might order more novel foods in situations where they are motivated to signal their desirability to prospective mates."

## Findings suggest that gender discrimination and sexual harassment are common experiences among residents in general surgery programs. 80% of women and 17% of men reported experiencing gender discrimination, and 43% of women and 22% of men reported experiencing sexual harassment.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2782358):

> Question What are the experiences of residents in general surgery programs with regard to gender discrimination and sexual harassment? Meaning This study's findings suggest that gender discrimination and sexual harassment are common experiences among residents in general surgery programs; these phenomena warrant multifaceted context-specific strategies for improvement. Objective To describe the types, sources, and factors associated with discrimination based on gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation and sexual harassment experienced by residents in general surgery programs across the US. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional national survey study was conducted after the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination.

## "Early childhood Medicaid eligibility reduces mortality and disability, increases employment, and reduces receipt of disability transfer programs up to 50 years later. Medicaid has saved the government more than its original cost and saved more than 10 million quality adjusted life years."

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20171671):

> This paper estimates the long-run effects of childhood Medicaid eligibility on adult health and economic outcomes using the program's original introduction and its mandated coverage of welfare recipients. The design compares cohorts born in different years relative to Medicaid implementation, in states with different preexisting welfare-based eligibility. Early childhood Medicaid eligibility reduces mortality and disability, increases employment, and reduces receipt of disability transfer programs up to 50 years later.
