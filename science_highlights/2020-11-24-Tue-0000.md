## Scientists showed that glycine, the simplest amino acid and an important building block of life, can form in dense interstellar clouds well before they transform into new stars and planets. Glycine can form on the surface of icy dust grains, in the absence of energy, through ‘dark chemistry'.

> “Dark chemistry refers to chemistry without the need of energetic radiation. In the laboratory we were able to simulate the conditions in dark interstellar clouds where cold dust particles are covered by thin layers of ice and subsequently processed by impacting atoms causing precursor species to fragment and reactive intermediates to recombine.”

## Financial payments from the drug industry to U.S. physicians was associated with increased prescribing of the paying drug company's drug. The association was consistent across all studies and several studies presented evidence that the association was not correlation, but causation.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/acop-fpf111720.php):

> Financial payments from drug industry associated with physician prescribing. A systematic review of published research found that financial payments from the drug industry to U.S. physicians was associated with increased prescribing of the paying drug company's drug. Researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center reviewed 36 published studies comprising 101 analysis to evaluate whether receipt of payments from the drug industry is associated with physician prescribing practices.

> Now let's remember that nurse practitioners are not required to report payments like physicians are. But I'm sure there's nothing to see there...

## COVID-19 cases could nearly double before Biden takes office. Proven model developed by Washington University, which accurately forecasted the rate of COVID-19 growth over the summer of 2020, predicts 20 million infected Americans by late January.

Summary of [original article](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/11/covid-19-cases-could-nearly-double-before-biden-takes-office/):

> The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are likely to increase to 20 million by the end of January, nearly doubling the current level of 11.4 million cases, predicts a Washington University in St. Louis COVID-19 forecasting model. If we continue, as a nation, at the current level of social distancing, the model forecasts that we are likely to reach 20 million cases before the end of January 2021. "However, more recently, testing has increased, and probably more like 25% of cases are diagnosed. In that case, total COVID cases would increase beyond 20 million in the next few months unless we, as a society, engage in more social distancing."

`/u/KombatSpyder` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzgtlf/covid19_cases_could_nearly_double_before_biden/):

> I honestly think the reason the numbers are going up is that many people no longer care. Some people never did, but many did for a long time. They are now burnt out and want to live their lives regardless of the consequences. It may not be the right thing to do, and I agree it's selfish, but many people no longer give a $h1t.

## For the first time scientists have made a discovery of hallucinogenic drug remains at the site of an early California cave painting. These drug remnants were discovered in the ceiling of Pinwheel Cave and could change scientists’ understanding of how the community used that space -- and the drugs.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/native-californian-rock-art-hallucinogens):

> Robinson and his colleagues also found remnants which suggest the cave was used widely - there's evidence of hunting, gathering, cooking, eating, and potentially storage taking place in the Pinwheel Cave. A painting possibly representing the flowers of Datura on the ceiling of a Californian rock art site called Pinwheel Cave was discovered alongside fibrous quids in the same ceiling. Even though Native Californians are historically documented to have used Datura to enter trance states, little evidence exists to associate it with rock art.

`/u/DoctorCrocker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzpeak/for_the_first_time_scientists_have_made_a/):

> Woah, Datura. That’s supposed to be *highly* unpleasant

## Two new multidisciplinary studies document persistent human occupation along the South African eastern seaboard from 35,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago. The first direct evidence of coastal foraging in Africa during a glacial maximum and across a glacial/interglacial transition is documented.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/asu-apr112320.php):

> The Last Glacial Maximum was the period of maximum global ice volume, and it affected people and places around the world. According to Fisher, "The work we are doing in Mpondoland is the latest in a long line of international and multidisciplinary research in South Africa revealing fantastic insights into human adaptations that often occurred at or near coastlines. Yet until now, no one had any idea what people were doing at the coast during glacial periods in southern Africa. Our records finally start to fill in these longstanding gaps and reveal a rich, but not exclusive, focus on the sea. Interestingly, we think it may have been the centralized location between land and sea and their plant and animal resources that attracted people and supported them amid repeated climatic and environmental variability." It is another link to the coastline for the people living at Waterfall Bluff during the Last Glacial Maximum.

## Some Amazon rainforest regions are more resistant to climate change than previously thought. It was thought that dry air limits photosynthesis, but in these wet regions, photosynthesis and carbon uptake actually increase when the air is drier, as plants generate more efficient leaves in response.

Summary of [original article](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/gentine-climate-change-rainforest-regions):

> The current Earth system models used for climate predictions show that the Amazon rainforest is very sensitive to water stress. "To our knowledge, this is the first basin-wide study to demonstrate how-contrary to what models are showing-photosynthesis is in fact increasing in some of the very wet regions of the Amazon rainforest during limited water stress," said Pierre Gentine, associate professor of earth and environmental engineering and of earth and environmental sciences and affiliated with the Earth Institute. "Our results mean that the current models are overestimating carbon losses in the Amazon rainforest due to climate change. Thus, in this particular region, these forests may in fact be able to sustain photosynthesis rates, or even increase it, with some warming and drying in the future."

`/u/3dPrintedZoidberg` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzs9xf/some_amazon_rainforest_regions_are_more_resistant/):

> Are those regions also resistant to "accidental" wildfires?

## Researchers find empirical evidence that social connection may be a "basic human need" like hunger. Social isolation (10 hours) induces cravings, and influences brain activity in the dopaminergic mid-brain similar to fasting.
