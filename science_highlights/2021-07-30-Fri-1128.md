## A toxic workplace triples your risk of depression, a new study finds. Companies that fail to reward or acknowledge their employees for hard work, impose unreasonable demands on workers, and do not give them autonomy are placing their staff at a much greater risk of depression.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/a-toxic-workplace-triples-your-risk-of-depression-new-study-finds.html):

> If you work at a company that doesn't value your psychological well-being, your risk of depression doesn't just go up a bit - it shoots up 300 percent. What does not valuing psychological health and safety look like in practice? The research team evaluated companies' commitment to mental health using a standard scale that asks workers to agree or disagree with statements such as "Senior management acts decisively when a concern of an employee's psychological status is raised" and "Senior management considers employee psychological health to be as important as productivity." Taken together, the two results suggest that toxic workplaces where employees are bullied, demeaned, unappreciated, and worked past their breaking point are both less successful and actively harmful to team members' mental health.

## Researchers have debunked a popular anti-vaccination theory by showing there was no evidence of COVID-19 – or the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines – entering your DNA.

Summary of [original article](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/article/2021/07/no-covid-19-does-not-enter-our-dna):

> Professor Geoff Faulkner from the Queensland Brain Institute is refuting claims that COVID-19 can enter a person's DNA. He says that claims have led to "Scaremongering" and people should not hesitate to be vaccinated. Professor Faulkner team's research published in Cell Reports showed there was no evidence of COVID-19 - or the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - entering DNA. No evidence of vaccines entering DNA. "The evidence refutes this concept being used to fuel vaccine hesitancy," he said. No COVID-19 in human DNA. "We assessed the claims in cells grown in the laboratory, conducted DNA sequencing and found no evidence of COVID-19 in DNA.".

> I’m not trying to be a smartass or anything, but scientists have known mRNA vaccines don’t alter your DNA since the advent of the technology. mRNA vaccines have significantly less potential complications than previous vaccines, and will most likely take over as the leading vaccine technology in the near future.

## The Quantum Refrigerator. By combining quantum theory and thermodynamics, it is possible to design a new kind of atomic refrigerator, which can cool down extremely cold Bose-Einstein-condensates even further.

## Einstein was right (again): Astronomers detect light from behind black hole

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-07-29/albert-einstein-astronomers-detect-light-behind-black-hole/100333436):

> Catching hidden lightDr Wilkins and his team were studying these X-ray flares spewing out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy called I Zwicky 1.Using NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton telescope, they saw the expected bright X-ray flashes - but there was also something strange going on. Discovery provides insight into supermassive black holesIn addition to proving Einstein's theory of relativity is right once again, the discovery could also help astronomers better understand supermassive black holes, Dr Cowley said. "The exciting thing about this observation is that it is light bent around a black hole."It tells us what the material around the black hole is doing, at a resolution we couldn't ever hope to achieve with conventional telescopes.

## About 74 million lives could be saved this century if humans cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/29/1021247014/cutting-carbon-pollution-quickly-would-save-millions-of-lives-study-finds):

> Reducing Climate Pollution Saves Lives, Study Finds Cutting carbon emissions to zero in the next 30 years would save about 74 million lives this century, a new analysis estimates. "There have been over 100 U.S. government regulations where the social cost of carbon was used," says Maureen Cropper, a climate economist at the University of Maryland, who co-chaired a 2017 National Academies of Sciences committee on the social cost of carbon. At least 11 states also use the social cost of carbon to inform decisions about their power grids, efficiency regulations and other climate policies, Cropper says, and Canada based its own cost number on the original U.S. calculations.

## Scientists have found only 49 percent reported planning to vaccinate their youngest child when a Covid-19 vaccine is approved for children, while 26 percent of parents said they were unsure and 25 percent said they will not vaccinate their child.

> **Interesting**: Asian parents were most likely to report planning to vaccinate children in the U.S. survey while parents with less than a college education and income less than $25,000 were most likely to be vaccine hesitant. In contrast, a higher proportion of parents in NYC (62 percent) reported planning to vaccinate their youngest child against Covid-19, while 15 percent were unsure and 23 percent did not plan to vaccinate. Also in NYC, non-Hispanic Black parents were less likely to report plans to vaccinate their children for Covid-19 compared to other race/ethnicity groups.

## Behavioral experiments with dung beetles demonstrated that light pollution disrupted their ability to orient themselves using natural celestial cues, dramatically changing their navigation behavior.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00833-2):

> While some recent research used simulated light pollution to estimate how skyglow may affect orientation behavior,7Ugolini A.Boddi V.Mercatelli L.Castellini C.Moon orientation in adult and young sandhoppers under artificial light. To distinguish between the effects of direct light pollution and indirect light pollution on orientation behavior, we performed a further set of experiments under clear skies, in which either direct or indirect light pollution dominated the scene. From this first simultaneous comparison of light pollution's effects on both the visual environment and orientation performance of a nocturnal insect, we find that light pollution interfered with orientation behavior under most conditions.

## What Animals See in the Stars, and What They Stand to Lose. Humans aren’t the only species that navigate by starlight. Animals from birds to dung beetles may do it, too — and might become disoriented as our city lights drown out the heavens.
