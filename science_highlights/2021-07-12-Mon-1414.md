## Every spot of urban green space counts - "An international study of parks and gardens finds even the humble roadside verge plays an important role in the environment and for our health."

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/every-spot-urban-green-space-counts):

> The study took soil samples from different types of urban green spaces and comparable neighbouring natural ecosystems in 56 cities from 17 countries across six continents. The urban green spaces studied included Olympic Park in Beijing, the University of Queensland campus in Brisbane, Retiro in Madrid, Spain, and the park surrounding Uppsala Castle in Uppsala, Sweden. With 68 per cent of the global population set to live in cities by 2050, the study suggests that urban green spaces are critically important for promoting mental and physical wellbeing.

> 
> Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, autoimmune disorder in which a person's own immune system damages the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks to several years. Most people recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage.

## After cutbacks and layoffs, remaining employees were more likely to feel they were treated fairly if the companies invested in them. Those investments can include training, team-building, or improving company culture. Even keeping workloads manageable after layoffs can help employees’ job attitudes.

> Ugh.  No offense to the OP because it is an interesting article, but I just, personally, hate the mentality of “company culture” and “team building.”  
> 
> Want happy employees?  Pay them more, and give them the best benefits you can find in the market.
> 
> Want a loyal workforce?  Take care of your employees with flexible scheduling in businesses where it is possible, adequate sick leave, family leave, and vacation.  Provide them with a decent retirement plan with adequate company matching. 
> 
> Too often, “company culture” has become synonymous with “we put a fooseball table in the break room and a sliding board between floors,” which is just a ploy to keep people in the office and away from their lives/families/non-work-related existence for more time per week. 
> 
> …and most attempts at team building end up being forced non-job-related socialization. I’ll become friends with who I want to, and I’ll work with whoever I need to, but team building always seems so forced and has nothing to do with the actual job.

> Maybe it’s just me…

## Increased interactions with immigrants can reduce opposition to immigration among natives. Swedes who work in small workplaces with immigrants that share the same skill set are far less likely to vote for the Sweden Democrats (an anti-immigration political party).

## Dogs tune into people in ways even human-raised wolves don’t. Researchers have found domestication has reworked dogs’ brains to make the pooches innately drawn to people — and perhaps to intuit human gestures.

## More than a third of coal miners and former coal miners suffering from black lung disease struggle with depression, and more than one in 10 has recently considered suicide. Researchers are calling for more mental health resources and treatment for current and former miners

Summary of [original article](https://news.virginia.edu/content/depression-suicidal-thoughts-plague-ailing-coal-miners-study-finds):

> More than a third of coal miners and former coal miners suffering from black lung disease struggle with depression, and more than one in 10 has recently considered suicide, a new study finds. The study is believed to be the first to examine mental health issues in a large population of coal miners in the United States. "Although coal mining is on the decline, the rates of black lung in Southwest Virginia continue to increase. Coal miners in Central Appalachia face disparities in health related to a range of complex social, economic, occupational and behavioral factors," said researcher Dr. Drew Harris, a pulmonary medicine expert at UVA Health.

> I can weigh in on this! My dad was an above ground miner aka strip miner for 20 years. He worked 70 hour weeks for most of my childhood and got a 4 year mining degree straight out of high school.
> 
> He really struggled with depression at times and in my non-professional opinion it was because he made great money at the mines, he had planned it as his whole future and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
> 
> He thought he would be a miner his whole life and then the mines started cutting back so the union went on strike for a long time. Then the mine went into a form of bankruptcy and fought with the union over the pension fund and healthcare promises. They wanted to hand it out in bonuses to their execs. It was an emotional roller coaster for him.
> 
> Imagine working 70 hr weeks 20 years of your life for a fund and then lawyers show up and tell you that it may not be your money anymore and your lifetime healthcare plan may be canceled.
> 
> It took something like 15 years but the mines lost the suit and dad has his retirement and his lifetime healthcare but I will say it made him an emotional wreck. He did sales a bit after that and finally got another job working heavy equipment. He is retired retired currently but hasn't begun his social security yet pending the go ahead from his financial advisor.
> 
> Our postive ending is a testament to the power of the union. If he had worked non-union they would have told him how it would be and he would have had to accept it. The union hired lawyers and fought for 15 years until it was made right.

## Rise in forest clearance in Southeast Asia increasing greenhouse gases. Scientists have found more than 400 million metric tons of carbon are released into the atmosphere every year as forests are cleared in the region, with that emissions figure increasing in recent years.

Summary of [original article](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4868/rise-in-forest-clearance-increasing-greenhouse-gases):

> The authors found that forest clearance in Southeast Asia's mountains has accelerated during the 21st century, accounting for a third of total forest loss in the region. Combining forest loss data with a forest biomass carbon map, they discovered that carbon loss resulting from forest clearance was mainly in the lowlands in the 2000s, for example in Indonesia. In the 2010s lowland forest carbon loss decreased while mountain forest carbon loss in regions like Myanmar and Laos increased significantly.

`/u/Noktar` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oitpc7/rise_in_forest_clearance_in_southeast_asia/):

> It feels so hopeless sometimes watching humanity accelerate climate change and destroy the planet. This won’t lead anywhere good. We’re such a shortsighted greedy species and we can’t even muster the resolve to deal with an existential threat. This is our great filter. Hopefully any intelligent species that rise up after us don’t repeat any of our mistakes.
