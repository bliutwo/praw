## Conservatives and liberals differ on COVID-19 because conservatives tend to attribute negative outcomes to purposeful actions by threats high in agency. If health officials talked about the virus as a palpable enemy that is seeking to attack humans, they may get greater buy-in from conservatives.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/lu-hwc111320.php):

> Conservatives are generally more sensitive to threats that are relatively high in agency, propose Daniel Zane, assistant professor of marketing in Lehigh University's College of Business, and co-author Luke Nowlan, assistant professor of marketing at KU Leuven, Belgium, in their study. According to the paper, "Getting Conservatives and Liberals to Agree on the COVID-19 Threat," published in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research in September, conservatives tend to see free will as the primary driver of outcomes in life, whereas liberals are more accepting of the idea that randomness plays a role. "According to our study, conservatives might at least in part be less likely to wear masks because they don't feel as threatened by the virus itself," says Zane.

## Scientists have successfully used molecules to shut down the production of destructive proteins generated by the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, the researchers are working to aerosolize the RNA molecules so that they could be incorporated in an inhalable drug that would mitigate viral chaos.

> So they showed they can use RNAi to inhibit viral protein replication in a clinically irrelevant cell line. Cool. Something people have done for well over 25 years... and they say in the abstract the biggest flaw in using this therapeutically. Haven't dug into the paper deeply enough but from what I read so far this is typical media department hyped-up garbage.

## Americans are less likely to travel following close elections, and that families comprised of members with strong, opposing political views are more likely to shorten their Thanksgiving dinner. Study used large-scale cell phone location data during the 2016 Thanksgiving holiday.

Summary of [original article](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sf/soaa101/5975166):

> How does intense politicization in close elections affect our close relationships? Using four national egocentric network surveys during the 1992, 2000, 2008, and 2016 election cycles, I find that close elections are associated with a modest decrease in network isolation in Americans' political discussion networks. Close election −0.049 −0.049+ −0.049+ −0.052+ N 4,419 4,390 4,570 4,537 State-year FE Yes Yes Yes Yes Baseline controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Political controls No Yes No Yes Next, I examine two potential pathways by which close elections precipitate the evaporation of opposing views in one's social networks, the political salience mechanism and the negative campaign mechanism. Since political conversation is more likely to be politicized and polarized in close elections than non-close elections, the context of close elections may reduce the likelihood of traveling to see one's family.

## MIT chemists have determined the molecular structure of a protein found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This protein, called the envelope protein E, forms a cation-selective channel and plays a key role in the virus’s ability to replicate itself and stimulate the host cell’s inflammation response.

> Brilliant work through and through. They took knowledge from a previous project, applied the fundamental principles to this problem and came out with a real finding. I love the summation at the end of the article as well. This is true science. As someone in clinical practice now but with a proud past of bench work in my graduate degree this is great to see.

## New psychology study sheds light on how willpower beliefs can influence romantic relationships

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/new-psychology-study-sheds-light-on-how-willpower-beliefs-can-influence-romantic-relationships-58522):

> A new study provides evidence that beliefs about one's own willpower can impact how people respond to their romantic partner's annoying and bothersome behavior. "Typically, willpower beliefs have been studied in relation to people's personal outcomes, with limited willpower beliefs being associated with less desirable outcomes," said study author Zoë Francis, an assistant professor of psychology at University of the Fraser Valley. To better understand how willpower beliefs influence romantic relationship dynamics, the researchers used Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform to survey 428 individuals who were cohabitating with their partner.

> The article mentions it but a big gap here is *saying* how you’d respond vs how you’d *actually* respond. It’s a hard thing to test in practice but I think their theory has a lot of merit.

## New research indicates that while threesomes are a very common sexual fantasy , only 30% of a surveyed group (n=1575) had a history of mixed-gender threesomes. Results indicate that we wait for the right context and partner(s) to engage in them, and that they are generally positive experiences.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/new-research-expands-our-scientific-understanding-of-threesomes-58526):

> "Anecdotally, I noticed that men were stigmatized more for engaging in a MGT with a member of the same sex, whereas women were stigmatized for engaging in a MGT with two members of the other sex. This conversation was the catalyst for what has turned into a long-term research program assessing MGT attitudes, interest, experience, and outcomes." Approximately 81% of the participants reported some degree of interest in engaging in a MGT and both samples had neutral-to-positive attitudes toward MGTs. But only 30.07% of participants indicated that they had experienced a threesome. "Additionally, only a single-item measure was used to assess outcomes. Thus, we were unable to determine which aspects of MGT experiences were perceived most and least positively, nor were we able to assess variations in outcomes according to the type of MGT," Thompson said.

## Dogs are sensitive to their owners' choice despite their own preference. Although the studies did not demonstrate that dogs override their own preferences for an object, the results suggested that the owners' expressed preference was perceived by the dogs and guided their perceptual focus.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/elu-das111220.php):

> Although the studies did not demonstrate that dogs override their own preferences for an object, the results suggested that the owners' expressed preference was perceived by the dogs and guided their perceptual focus. „Fetching was clearly not a good choice to measure dogs' sensitivity to others' preferences for several reasons" notes Kubinyi, „since their own favorite object was in reach, the dogs had little incentive to factor in the owner's choice in their responses. Fifty-one dogs were assigned to one of two experimental groups: a matching/congruent condition where owners displayed happy expressions towards the toy and made disgusted faces towards the bracelet, and a non-matching/incongruent condition, where owners showed happiness toward the bracelet and disgust toward the toy.
