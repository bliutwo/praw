## People who take microdoses of psychedelic drugs consistently report that it results in improved mood and creativity, while having few side effects, according to new research published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/10/people-who-microdose-psychedelic-drugs-report-that-the-benefits-greatly-outweigh-the-drawbacks-58328):

> People who take microdoses of psychedelic drugs consistently report that it results in improved mood and creativity, while having few side effects, according to new research published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. Importantly, 4,783 participants reported having microdosed LSD in the last 12 months, 2,832 reported having microdosed psilocybin in the last 12 months, and 862 participants reported microdosing both of the psychedelic drugs in the last 12 months. "Generally speaking, those who microdose report that the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks," Petranker told PsyPost.

> My biggest issue with the study is it is people who chose to seek that out as a treatment and who self report the results. So, you have a personality/temperament bias. People who seek out mushrooms of their own volition isn’t a control.

## Anti-vaxxers have rebranded: Vaccine opponents have shifted their messaging toward the promotion of civil liberties. Between 2009 to 2019, conversations around civil liberties in the anti-vaccine community had increased, with Facebook pages framing vaccines as an issue of values and civil rights.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-anti-vaccine-vaxxer-vaccination-trump-movement-mask-b1219944.html):

> Historically, the anti-vaccine community has been known for its concerns around vaccine safety and the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism. The rebranding to emphasize liberties is allowing vaccine opponents to exploit American reactions to the pandemic, said Dorit Reiss, a University of California Hastings law professor who specializes in policy issues related to vaccines. Shortly after her remark, accounts and pages on Facebook and Twitter that support medical freedom began circulating a text post that said "Kamala won't take a vaccine that DJT pushed. Imagine being forced to take a mandated vaccine from a leader you disagree with!! The irony. Do you NOW understand what Medical Freedom means?".

> Clever of them unfortunately ( though clever isnt a term one might associate with these people).  I listened to an interesting podcaste a while ago ( which I have mentioned before so apologies) which said that research shows facts make no difference to the choices people like anti-vaxers ( and others) make - you can even convince them that vaccines arent harmful  in fact , but they still wont have them. What makes up their minds is how these things fit into their and their peer group's values. Anti-vaxers identified strongly with values like freedom of choice and 'purity' (whatever that is). The researchers said that if you wanted to change their minds then you needed to reframe how vaccination might better fit those values rather than just telling them factors. This report seems like the anti-vaxers reinforcing the connection of *anti*-vaccination to those group values as a defense against any attempts to undermine their position. The research suggests it would work, again unfortunately.

## A new electron microscope provides "unprecedented structural detail," allowing scientists to "visualize individual atoms in a protein, see density for hydrogen atoms, and image single-atom chemical modifications."

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2833-4):

> At resolutions better than 4 Å, atomic model building starts to become possible, but the direct visualization of true atomic positions in protein structure determination requires much higher resolution, which so far has not been attained by cryo-EM. The direct visualization of atom positions is essential for understanding the mechanisms of protein-catalysed chemical reactions, and for studying how drugs bind to and interfere with the function of proteins2. The atomic models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the following accession codes: 1.56  structure 6Z9F, 1.55  structure 6Z9E, 1.33  structure 7A6B, 1.25  structure 6Z6U, and 1.15  structure 7A6A. The cryo-EM maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank as follows: 1.56  map, 1.55  map, 1.33  map, 1.25  map and 1.15  map. At higher thresholds the two structures at 1.54  and 1.55  resolution nicely maintain the shapes of the sidechains but only in the structure at 1.25 Å; resolution individual atoms become clearly separated from each other indicating true atomic resolution.

> I wonder what the cost of this is, and if we could start seeing much higher resolution of many proteins.

## Humans are born with brains ‘prewired’ to see words, study finds. Brain scans of newborns showed a part of the visual cortex was connected to the language network of the brain, even before any exposure to language.

## Superwhite paint can cool buildings even in hot sunlight

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2257749-superwhite-paint-can-cool-buildings-even-in-hot-sunlight/):

> A new superwhite paint is so reflective that it can cool a surface to below the surrounding air temperature, even under sunlight. Xiulin Ruan at Purdue University and his colleagues developed a white paint that was so reflective and good at radiating heat that it cooled a surface to 1.7°C below the surrounding noon air temperature during tests in Indiana. Ruan estimates a typical US home of 200 square metres would save about $50 per month on cooling costs, compared with using an existing heat-resistant paint.

## How early Homo sapiens responded to climate change reveals a "hallmark" of our species. Analysis of a drilled core representing 1 million years of environmental history suggests a major transition in ancient tool tech was prompted by adaptation to environmental threats.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/ancient-human-adaptability-tool-study):

> Years ago, ancient humans broke the mold. In a study released Wednesday in Science Advances, scientists show how adaptability, as well as our long, ambivalent relationship with nature, may have led ancient humans to switch up their tools. Abstract: Although climate change is widely considered to have been a large-scale driver of African human evolution, landscape-scale shifts in ecological resources that may have shaped novel hominin adaptations are rarely investigated.

`/u/frakme2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jg06df/how_early_homo_sapiens_responded_to_climate/):

> Change was good. Change is good. Change will be good.
> 
> For the most part, people hate change, but we wouldn't be here today as a species if change didn't happen.
