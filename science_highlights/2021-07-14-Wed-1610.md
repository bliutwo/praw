## Researchers develop a self-healing cement paste inspired by the process of CO2 transport in biological cells. This novel mechanism actively consumes CO2 while strengthening the existing concrete structures. The ability to heal instead of replace concrete offers significant environmental benefits.

> Intriguing. So they use a ubiquitous enzyme to catalyze the precipitation of calcite (CaCO2), which then grows in a polycrystalline form filling cracks and pores. Apparently the enzyme is common enough and highly stable; the paper cites the ability to catalyze millions of reactions per molecule.
> 
> There may be some potential here in rapid CO2 sequestering. I wonder what the $/tonne CO2 sequestered ratio is for methods employing this enzyme, and what the major cost bottleneck is for this method.

## Wolves Raised by Humans Can't Understand People like Dogs Can

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wolves-raised-by-humans-cant-understand-people-like-dogs-can/):

> Something far in the shared evolutionary past of dogs and humans has linked the two species, making our canine companions especially good at understanding when we want to help or communicate with them. In a separate test, the dogs were 30 times more likely to approach an unknown human and made significantly more eye contact with people than the little wolves, the researchers report today in Current Biology. Outside of the tests, Salomons notes that while young wolves and dogs are both adorable and do a lot of the same things, their responses to humans could not be more different.

## Children exposed to elevated levels of air pollution may be more likely to have poor inhibitory control during late childhood and poor academic skills in early adolescence, including spelling, reading comprehension, and math skills

Summary of [original article](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/air-pollution-exposure-linked-poor-academics-childhood):

> Children exposed to elevated levels of air pollution may be more likely to have poor inhibitory control during late childhood and poor academic skills in early adolescence, including spelling, reading comprehension, and math skills. "By compromising childhood inhibitory control, prenatal exposure to air pollution may alter the foundation upon which later academic skills are built." "This study adds to a growing body of literature showing the deleterious health effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution on child health outcomes, including academic achievement," says co-author Julie Herbstman, PhD, CCCEH director and associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School.

`/u/helptlou` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ok3rsj/children_exposed_to_elevated_levels_of_air/):

> Couldn’t this be more correlation than causation? Where is air pollution worse on average? In the same places where education is worse, right? (such as inner cities)
> 
> Not doubting that air pollution is bad for *everyone’s* brains but the schools are certainly worse in areas that have more air pollution along with the families enrolled likely being of a lower social class on average, which is known to be bad for pretty much everything related to growing as a human.

## The Genome of a Human From an Unknown Population Has Been Recovered From Cave Dirt

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-human-genome-has-been-recovered-from-cave-dirt):

> A cup of mud that has been buried beneath the floor of a cave for millennia has just yielded up the genome of an ancient human. The cave was used by ancient humans for thousands of years, and yet only a single individual's genome from the site had ever been sequenced, from a human that lived 15,000 years ago. Finally, mitochondrial DNA found in the bison genome can also be found in living, present-day bison.

## According to new research, middle managers attempt to address workplace injustices by secretly helping out their subordinates when they can. In fact, managers with an especially strong moral code can consider it their duty to right the wrongs they see, and to compensate victims in hidden ways.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/uobc-hcm071321.php):

> A new study co-authored by the UBC Sauder School of Business has found that when senior managers mistreat workers, middle managers often attempt to quietly smooth things over. According to new research from UBC Sauder, middle managers also get in on the act, and attempt to address workplace injustices by secretly helping out their subordinates when they can. For the paper, titled When Managers Become Robin Hoods: A Mixed Method Investigation, the research team from UBC Sauder, Emlyon, University of Colorado and the University of Toulouse first interviewed 35 middle managers - 20 men and 15 women - at a European publishing company that employs roughly 550 workers.

## If everyone in America went vegan, their green house gas (GHG) emissions would only decrease by 2.6%

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301):

> In the simulated system with no animals, estimated agricultural GHG decreased, but did not fully counterbalance the animal contribution of GHG. This assessment suggests that removing animals from US agriculture would reduce agricultural GHG emissions, but would also create a food supply incapable of supporting the US population's nutritional requirements. The objective of this study was to compare the current contribution of animals to the US food supply and agricultural GHG by comparing current food production to a modeled system in which animal agriculture and animal-derived foods are eliminated. The modeled removal of animals from the US agricultural system resulted in predictions of a greater total production of food, increases in deficient essential nutrients and excess of energy in the US population's diet, a potential increase in foods/nutrients that can be exported to other countries, and a decrease of 2.6 percentage units in US GHG emissions.

## Deforestation and climate change are altering the Amazon rainforest's ability to soak up carbon, according to a new study - Significant parts of the world's largest tropical forest have started to emit more CO2 than they absorb.

> >Amazonia hosts the Earth’s largest tropical forests and has been shown to be an important carbon sink over recent decades. This carbon sink seems to be in decline, however, as a result of factors such as deforestation and climate change. Here we investigate Amazonia’s carbon budget and the main drivers responsible for its change into a carbon source. We performed 590 aircraft vertical profiling measurements of lower-tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at four sites in Amazonia from 2010 to 20184. We find that total carbon emissions are greater in eastern Amazonia than in the western part, mostly as a result of spatial differences in carbon-monoxide-derived fire emissions. Southeastern Amazonia, in particular, acts as a net carbon source (total carbon flux minus fire emissions) to the atmosphere. Over the past 40 years, eastern Amazonia has been subjected to more deforestation, warming and moisture stress than the western part, especially during the dry season, with the southeast experiencing the strongest trends. We explore the effect of climate change and deforestation trends on carbon emissions at our study sites, and find that the intensification of the dry season and an increase in deforestation seem to promote ecosystem stress, increase in fire occurrence, and higher carbon emissions in the eastern Amazon. This is in line with recent studies that indicate an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in photosynthesis as a result of climatic changes across Amazonia.
