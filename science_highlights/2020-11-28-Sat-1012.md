## Sleep deprivation impairs the suppression of unwanted thoughts and memories which enter conscious awareness when individuals confront reminders. Sleep-deprived people experienced significantly more intrusions and unsuccessful suppressions of unwanted thoughts.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702620951511):

> Participants initially encoded face-scene pairs by studying them one at a time for 6 s.
To reinforce learning and ensure adequate knowledge of the face-scene pairs, we then had participants complete a test phase in which faces were displayed individually for up to 4 s and participants indicated whether they were able to fully visualize the associated scene.
Sleep-deprived participants exhibited significantly higher relapse probability scores than did the sleep group, F(1, 57) = 7.08, p =.010, ηp2 =.11, indicating that after initially gaining control over an intrusive thought, they suffered intrusion relapses more than participants who had slept.
Prior research suggests that in healthy participants, acute sleep deprivation increases LF-HRV.
Replicating this work, our sleep-deprived participants exhibited higher LF-HRV compared with participants who slept.

## High achievement cultures may kill students' interest in math—specially for girls. Girls were significantly less interested in math in countries like Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden and New Zealand. But, surprisingly, the roles were reversed in countries like Oman, Malaysia, Palestine and Kazakhstan.

> In the UK, there's a culture of "ugh maths is hard, I can't do it, I hate it" particularly in older generations, which must have an influence on newer generations. Is this a thing in other countries?

## Children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers — and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson. Retribution is a driving force in young children’s moral judgement.

Summary of [original article](https://news.yale.edu/2020/11/23/children-more-willing-punish-if-wrongdoer-taught-lesson):

> Many children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers - and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson, a new Yale study published Nov.
23 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour shows.
The children first had to decide whether to punish the art destroyer by taking away their iPad.
However, if the children decided to punish the transgressor, they would have to make a personal sacrifice - their own iPad would be locked away.
Children in the second group, who knew that the wrongdoer would be told why he or she was being disciplined, were 24% more likely to punish than the first group.

> I'd be interested to know more about the kids in their sample. one author says "Children are less exposed to social ideas about how to behave in certain ways" and it seems like the underlying assumption there is "because they have less exposure to ideas, their natural impulses will be more exposed" but that honestly seems like a HUGE assumption to make. it says the kids were between the ages of 4-7, which covers a huge range of developmental milestones. And even the youngest still has 4 years of being punished or disciplined by their own parents at the very least. What if they're not exhibiting natural inclinations as much as they are reflecting what they've observed and learned?

## Self-continuity forms the very basis of identity. Every time you use the word 'I', you're referring to a thread that stitches a series of experiences into a tapestry of a lifetime, representing a relationship between the self of your youth with one yet to emerge.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-confirm-there-is-a-part-of-you-that-remains-you-throughout-your-life?fbclid=IwAR0229vNIBB2xq6O-ckvbl6-B419j9TpFt-pCKx-PRLpnKiLIdBSisfmQbc):

> A new, small psychobiological study weighs in, looking at brain scans to conclude that at least some part of you is indeed consistent as you grow and age.
"In conjunction with the previous literature, our results indicate that there is a component that remains stable while another part is more susceptible to change over time." Significantly, neurological descriptions of the specific brain bits responsible for sorting self from stranger can help us better understand why some people don't share this impression.

> Very cool work, *but* (of *course* there's a but)... I don't see any clear connection between their conclusion (which you summarized nicely in your choice of quotes for the title) and what they measured.
> 
> They found a speck of brain that responds a certain way to pictures of ourselves in an image recognition task.  Okay, that's actually pretty impressive, but what the heck does it have to do with *anything* described in the title?

## Most people in the US did not have antibody evidence of previous COVID-19 infection, finds a new study of all 50 states. Fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, reinforcing the need for continued measures, including face masks and social distancing, to limit the spread.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2773576):

> In a US nationwide survey of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, we tested more than 177?000 residual specimens submitted for non-SARS-CoV-2 testing during 4 periods from July to September 2020 and found that in nearly all jurisdictions, fewer than 10% of people in the US had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection using currently available commercial IgG assays.
The few population-level seroprevalence surveys with repeated measurements are generally consistent with small changes over time.16,30,33 While the estimates in our study cannot be directly compared with results from an earlier commercial clinical laboratory seroprevalence survey10,16 because of differences in the geographic distribution of the 2 study populations, participating laboratories, and SARS-CoV-2 serology tests used in each study, we observed similar patterns of declining seroprevalence in New York and increasing seroprevalence in Minnesota.
In this US nationwide seroprevalence cross-sectional study, we found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and seroprevalence estimates varied widely by jurisdiction.

## The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team at National Museums NI.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/science/ireland-first-only-dinosaur-find-confirmed/?utm_source=DamnInteresting):

> The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team led by Dr.
Mike Simms, a curator and paleontologist at National Museums NI.
Drawing on the expertise of scientists from the University of Portsmouth and Queen's University Belfast, the two bone fragments were found to belong to two different individuals.
If you're into dinosaur hunting, Ireland is one of the most frustrating places to ply your trade.
"The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Ireland's rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores.
The two dinosaur fossils that Roger Byrne found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilized."

## As interactions increasingly take place online, people find information that confirms their existing beliefs, making them less willing to listen to alternatives. This exacerbates filter bubbles and explains why public debates become polarized as people become impervious to opposing arguments.

> You have to wonder how much social media companies have a part in this. If they build algorithms to present information similar to what the user has been viewing in the past, surely that can be a large part of what drives such unbalanced viewing. Facebook, Reddit, Amazon and all sorts of companies try this with the aim of keeping their "customers" more engaged, which keeps them coming back to the site.
