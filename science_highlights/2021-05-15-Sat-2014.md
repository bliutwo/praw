## Large pharmaceutical companies test drugs in dozens of foreign countries but often don't bother to make the drugs available to those nations once the drugs are approved in the US, a significant bioethics issue. Countries with lowest access to drugs tested on their residents were African countries.

## Studying science isn’t what makes students less religious: College majors that focus on inquiry rather than applying knowledge are more likely to secularize students, according to a new study that breaks with the traditional claim that exposure to science leads people away from religion.

## Politically polarized brains share an intolerance of uncertainty - A new study on political polarization showed how an aversion to uncertainty is often associated with black-and-white political views, for both liberals and conservatives.

Real Science, real knowledge in general, is constantly checking itself to make absolutely sure it's the truth. Otherwise, we lose the truth and just become cults.

## There was less wastage during production of marble slabs in the Roman imperial period than today. Analysis of wall decoration dating to the second century A.D. provides new insights into marble extraction and processing.

Summary of [original article](https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/13538_ENG_HTML.php):

> "To date no actual remains of marble workshops from the Roman imperial era have been found, so little is known about marble processing during this period," said Professor Cees Passchier of the Institute of Geosciences at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Finally, with the help of the software, the researchers created a three-dimensional model of the marble block, which in turn enabled them to draw conclusions about the material wastage during the production of the slabs. "The slabs are about 16 millimeters thick and the gaps between them, caused by sawing and subsequent polishing, are about 8 millimeters wide. This material loss attributable to production equates to around one third and is therefore less than the rates now commonly associated with many forms of modern marble production," Passchier pointed out.

> >Slabs of Cipollino Verde, composed of layered and folded marble from Euboea in Greece, decorated the hall of a Roman town house in Ephesos, Turkey in the second century AD. After excavation, the fragmented slabs were restored. Preservation of the dowels in the walls from which the slabs were originally suspended allowed reconstruction of the order in which they had been placed on the walls. The pattern of folded layering in the slabs in turn allowed 3D structural geological reconstruction of the folds, and reconstruction of the arrangement of slabs in the marble block, from where they were serially sectioned, using a slab saw. Investigation of geological fold alignment in the block revealed that 23–47% of the marble was lost in sawing and polishing, close to modern values. Comparison of the sequence of slabs on the walls and in the original block reveals the decoration strategy for the Roman hall. Slabs were placed in the sequence in which they had been cut from the block in book-matched fashion, with some rearrangement due to breakage of two slabs. Limited breakage was not due to sawing of slabs, but probably to the polishing process, or to transport of slabs. Analysis of ancient ornamental stone using geological 3D restoration techniques can provide important insights in the archaeology of stone working and trade.

## Eating a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is associated with less stress, according to new research. The findings revealed people who ate at least 470 grams of fruit and vegetables daily had 10 per cent lower stress levels than those who consumed less than 230 grams.

> Correlation is, as they say, not causation. Now, granted, the study isn't from the US, but in the US, at least, it's as likely to go the other way. People who have the kinds of jobs and lives that leave them stressed don't eat as much fruit and vegetables. If you're too busy at your two jobs to get worrying symptoms checked out, you're going to be eating fast food or rotisserie chickens rather than slicing cucumbers or peeling oranges.

## New species of crested dinosaur identified in Mexico

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/new-species-crested-dinosaur-identified-mexico-2021-05-14/):

> A team of palaeontologists in Mexico have identified a new species of dinosaur after finding its 72 million-year-old fossilized remains almost a decade ago, Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said on Thursday. The new species, named Tlatolophus galorum, was identified as a crested dinosaur after 80% of its skull was recovered, allowing experts to compare it to other dinosaurs of that type, INAH said. The Mexican anthropology body also explained the meaning of the name - Tlatolophus galorum - for the new species of dinosaur.

`/u/BikkaZz` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ndccq9/new_species_of_crested_dinosaur_identified_in/):

> “The investigation, which also included specialists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, began in 2013 with the discovery of an articulated tail in the north-central Mexican state of Coahuila, where other discoveries have been made.
> 
> The Mexican anthropology body also explained the meaning of the name - Tlatolophus galorum - for the new species of dinosaur.
> 
> Tlatolophus is a mixture of two words, putting together a term from the indigenous Mexican language of Nahuatl that means “word” with the Greek term meaning “crest”. Galorum refers to the people linked to the research, INAH said.”

## What is a face worth: Facial attractiveness biases experience‐based monetary decision‐making [Attractive, but financially disadvantageous partners were preferred to the same extent (or more) as unattractive‐advantageous partners]

Summary of [original article](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12495?campaign=wolearlyview):

> Following every partner‐selection, participants received feedback about the net monetary gains/losses the partner had conferred. Even though attractive and unattractive partners were equally profitable and despite receiving feedback, participants selected attractive partners more throughout the task were quicker to reselect them even when they conferred losses and judged them as more helpful. Importantly, the effect of attractiveness on decision‐making was fully explained by the perceived trustworthiness of the financial partners.
