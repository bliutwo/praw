## When a romantic partner is very responsive on some days and very unresponsive on other days, it can lead to more attachment issues than if the partner had average responsiveness - the first empirical evidence that responsiveness variability predicts attachment anxiety in romantic relationships.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550620944111):

> Extant theorizing in adult attachment made this distinction and argued that responsiveness variability is linked with anxious attachment and average responsiveness with avoidant attachment. To investigate the differential roles of responsiveness variability and average responsiveness in romantic attachment, the present study focused on partner-specific attachment orientations in fledgling couples for several reasons. Given the correlation between average responsiveness and responsiveness variability, we included both in the model so that we could show that the association of responsiveness variability with attachment anxiety was independent of average responsiveness.

## Countries led by women have not fared significantly better in the COVID-19 pandemic than those led by men- it may be just our Western media bias that makes us think they have

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244531):

> We examine national-level data for 175 countries around the world, accounting for Covid-19 infection and death rates, cultural traits [10, 11], gender parity in the national assembly, and whether each country is led by a woman or a man. Quality of Covid-19 policy responses from the Economist Intelligence Unit assessment of OECD countries, graphed according to gender of the national executive. Fatalities from COVID are concentrated among the elderly and those with significant comorbidities and both these populations are likely larger in countries with longer life expectancies.

## Desalination breakthrough could lead to cheaper water filtration - scientists report an increase in efficiency in desalination membranes tested by 30%-40%, meaning they can clean more water while using less energy, that could lead to increased access to clean water and lower water bills.

> Hey! This is my field! I'm sad that the paper didnt emphasize the most important part of membrane separations: we spend a lot of effort talking about how much more or less efficient membranes are for separations (which really just boils down to two quantities: the membrane *selectivity* and membrane *permeability*), but this isn't what will make them practically useful. Researchers are trying to shift the focus to making membranes that, despite efficiency, **last longer**. All other variables notwithstanding, membranes that maintain their properties for longer than a few days will make the largest practical difference in industry. 
> 
> To emphasize an extreme example of this (and one I'm more familiar with), in hydrocarbon separations, we use materials that are multiple decades old (Cellulose Acetate i.e., CA) rather than any of the new and modern membranes for this reason: they lose their selectivity usually after **hours** of real use. CA isnt very attractive on paper because its properties suck compared to say, PIM-1 (which is very selective and a newer membrane), but CA only has to be replaced once every two years or so.

## In a series of 6 studies across 4 countries, test subjects tend to cast women as victims and men as perpetrators, as well as assume that women suffer more harm and men deserve harsher punishments, when assessing differently-gendered but otherwise identical scenarios of workplace conflict

## Rats who are cooperative give off a special smell when they act helpful. If their conspecifics smell this odure, they prefer to share their food with these social rats - possibly in the hope of being supported by them one day.

Summary of [original article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2327):

> In the direct reciprocity paradigm, we tested whether a rat increases cooperative behaviour towards an individual that was helpful to them, whereas in the generalized reciprocity paradigm we tested whether rats generally increase their cooperation propensity if they experienced cooperative behaviour from any other conspecific. In conclusion, our study shows that in rats chemical cues originating from the cooperative behaviour of a conspecific are essential and more important than direct behavioural cues for the decision to perform altruistic helping behaviour towards a conspecific. Gerber N, Schweinfurth MK, Taborsky M. 2020.Data from: The smell of cooperation: rats increase helpful behaviour when receiving odour cues of a conspecific performing a cooperative task.

`/u/Q_Ahmad` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ko7k1c/rats_who_are_cooperative_give_off_a_special_smell/):

> Rats are a very social species. They barter, can feel remorse and are also considered compassionate animals. According to this study, rats can also be empathetic by reacting promptly when their behavior causes pain to their fellow species.
> 
> Since rats see comparatively poorly, the researchers tested the animals for their highly developed sense of smell.  To do this, they put two brown rats in a plexiglass box and separated them with a wire mesh. With the help of a wooden stick, one of the animals was able to provide food for its counterpart.
> 
> First, the scientists tested whether this rat shared the food if it could smell and see its conspecifics, and it to when the smells were sucked out. They then let in only the scent of rats from another cage, who were either cooperative or unhelpful, and observed the behavior again.
> 
> It turned out that the rats actually preferred to share their food if they could smell their counterpart.  It was noticeable that the test animals mainly helped rats that had previously been helpful - regardless of whether they had already been supported by them: The test rats tended to provide food more often for previously cooperative than for previously non-cooperative partners.
> 
> Further experiments showed that the rodents also tended to share their food with their counterpart more often when they smelled a strange conspecific.  The amazing thing, if they smelled the scent of cooperative social partners from another cage, they even helped those of their own species who were not helpful themselves.
> 
>  Regardless of whether the partner rat in the neighboring compartment was helpful or not - as soon as the test animal was blown into the cage by the smell of another rat helping another animal, it made it cooperative.
> 
> Surprisingly, the smell, and this alone, was responsible for the willingness of the test animals to help. This suggests that helpful rats release special odor molecules. This smell seems to be more decisive for the helpfulness of their fellows than the visible cooperative or non-cooperative behavior of the counterpart.
> 
> Geber and her colleagues concluded from this that rats unconsciously use the scent to signal their tendency to cooperate and thus increase their chances of receiving help in return.  Biologists speak of reciprocal behavior in which helpful animals do not seem to have any advantage for their own survival at first, but this increases the likelihood that they will receive something in return in the future.
> 
> Some studies have already indicated that fragrances are the key to finding a partner for us humans and that the smell of certain messenger substances can increase trust in others.  Future studies will now investigate whether there is also a analogous “scent of helpfulness” in humans.

## When men's masculinity feels threatened, they may attempt to restore it by withdrawing from relationships that could provide care and support. Not only could this harm the relationship and affect their romantic partner, but this tactic may not restore masculinity in the eyes of others.

> I think this study is false in a few ways. Isolating is common behavior for people that feel they’ve been attacked. Not to mention their argument could more easily be summed up as “some men aren’t good at handling rage.” This has been proven and most men will openly admit it.
