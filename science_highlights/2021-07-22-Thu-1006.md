## Scientists Witness Chimps Killing Gorillas for the First Time Ever. The surprising observation could yield new insights into early human evolution.

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/for-the-first-time-ever-scientists-witness-chimps-kill-1847330442):

> "At the first encounter, when we heard the initial chimpanzee screams, we actually thought our chimps had bumped into another group of chimpanzees," Lara Southern, a PhD student at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and first author of the study, explained in an email. For Wrangham the chimpanzee attack on the gorillas was not very surprising, given their interest in killing. Note, more observations are needed, ideally with gorillas that do not run from humans, to understand whether chimpanzees get any benefit from gorillicide beyond the thrill of killing.

## A new study reports that one third of the most popular cancer treatment articles on social media contain misinformation.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/hci-ssc072121.php):

> A new study published online today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that one third of the most popular cancer treatment articles on social media contain misinformation. "As a medical community, we can't ignore the problem of cancer misinformation on social media or ask our patients to ignore it. We must empathize with our patients and help them when they encounter this type of information. My goal is to help answer their questions, and provide cancer patients with accurate information that will give them the best chance for the best outcome." The cancer campus includes a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital, community clinics, a mobile screening program, and two buildings dedicated to cancer research.

> From living with an oncologist the last 10 years...that is about 60% lower than I expected it to be.

> Though I suppose "no actual information" is still not misinformation.

## Many ICU staff have experienced mental health disorders in COVID-19 pandemic. On average 48 percent of participants showed signs of mental health conditions - depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Summary of [original article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226513/many-icu-staff-have-experienced-mental/):

> "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical and mental health of healthcare workers around the world. The large number of patients admitted to hospital at the height of the pandemic has put considerable demand and pressure on ICUs and staff. Although there has been much reporting on the mental health of frontline workers there has been little done to assess the impact of the pandemic on those who were treating the sickest patients in ICU.". "Work related stress is well documented in healthcare workers and this has been worsened by the COVID-19 crisis. The results of this study suggest that all ICU staff should have access to early and effective mental health assistance as part of a wider staff health and wellbeing strategy. This is especially pressing as hospitals and governments prepare their workforce for potential further surges of COVID-19 patients." Although the mental health burden in healthcare workers caused by COVID-19 has gained increasing attention, there has been a lack of data, especially relating to healthcare workers in ICU. The researchers wanted to examine whether critical care staff experienced adverse mental health in a similar way to frontline healthcare workers, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Tomato fruits send electrical warnings to the rest of the plant when attacked by insects. Tomato fruits inform the mother plant when they are being eaten by caterpillars, shows a new study. This could provide more effective monitoring strategies for detecting agricultural pests in the future.
