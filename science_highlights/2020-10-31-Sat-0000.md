## Fatalities from COVID-19 are reducing Americans’ support for Republicans at every level of federal office. This implies that a greater emphasis on social distancing, masks, and other mitigation strategies would benefit the president and his allies.

Summary of [original article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/44/eabd8564?T=AU):

> The SEs in our regression results are clustered at the state-day or county-day level depending on the model. Our results are representative of the American public at the national level. Our county level results are also similar with and without don't knows.

> Just because he loses support from some people when COVID deaths go up doesn’t mean he won’t gain those people back but lose even more other supporters if he doubled down on mask wearing/social distancing messages.

## A German mandate allocating a third of corporate board seats to workers led to increases in capital investment. It had no impact on the profitability of the firms nor on the wages and employment by the firms.

> If it led to more invested capital, but resulted in no changes in profitability, wages, nor employment, then it means that more money was injected in the company, but it did not improve anything?

## In 2012, the Obama administration required airlines to show all mandatory fees and taxes in their advertised fares to consumers upfront. This was a massive win for consumers, as airlines were no longer able to pass a large share of the taxes onto consumers. Airlines subsequently lost revenue.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20190200):

> We show that the more prominent display of tax-inclusive prices is associated with significant reductions in consumer tax incidence, demand, and ticket revenues along more heavily taxed itineraries. In particular, the fraction of unit taxes that airlines passed onto consumers fell by roughly 75 cents for every dollar of tax. These results present evidence of consumer inattention in a novel institutional setting featuring quasi-experimental variation in tax salience, economically significant tax amounts, and endogenous price responses.

## 'Fireball' that fell to Earth is full of pristine extraterrestrial organic compounds, scientists say

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/nasa-meteor-meteorite-fireball-earth-space-b1372924.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1603807600):

> A fireball that fell to Earth in 2018 contains "Pristine extraterrestrial organic compounds" that could help tell us how life formed, scientists say. "These kinds of organic compounds were likely delivered to the early Earth by meteorites and might have contributed to the ingredients of life." "Scientists who study meteorites and space sometimes get asked, do you ever see signs of life? And I always answer, yes, every meteorite is full of life, but terrestrial, Earth life," says Heck.

> For everyone who didn't click on the article, this meteorite fell to earth back in 2018.
> 
> It was tracked with weather radar, fell on ice (rather than dirt) and was picked up quickly.
> 
> The article does not specify what  “pristine extraterrestrial organic compounds”  means, and I'm too lazy to hunt down the paper that they didn't bother linking to.
> 
> But if anyone thinks that this is definitely aliens, I'll bet you each $200 that you're wrong.

## To survive asteroid impact, algae learned to hunt. Tiny, seemingly harmless ocean plants survived the darkness of the asteroid strike that killed the dinosaurs by learning a ghoulish behavior -- eating other living creatures.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2020/10/30/survive-asteroid-impact-algae-learned-hunt):

> Along with the dinosaurs on the land and giant reptiles in the ocean, the dominant species of marine algae were instantly wiped out - except for one rare type. To answer their questions, the team examined well-preserved fossils of the surviving algae and created detailed computer models to simulate the likely evolution of the algae's feeding habits over time. Only much later did the algae evolve, losing the ability to eat other creatures and re-establishing themselves to become one of the dominant species of algae in today's ocean.

## Undocumented immigration does not increase the violent crime rate in U.S. metropolitan areas. In fact, it may reduce property crime rates. As the size of the undocumented population increases, the property crime rate decreases, on average.

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/undocumented-immigrants-may-actually-make-american-communities-safer-not-more-dangerous-new-study-finds-146829):

> We found in a 2017 study with colleagues that from 1970 to 2010 metropolitan areas with greater concentrations of immigrants, legal and undocumented combined, have less property crime than areas with fewer immigrants, on average. In statistical models that did identify a significant relationship between undocumented immigration and crime, we found undocumented immigration reduces property crimes, such as burglary. Using two different estimates of the undocumented immigrant populations for 154 metropolitan areas in our most recent study - one from the Pew Research Center and one from the Migration Population Institute - we examined the effect of undocumented immigration on homicide, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary and larceny crime rates.
