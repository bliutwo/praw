## Korean scientists developed a cancer-targeted phototherapeutic agent that promises complete elimination of cancer cells without side effects. It involves only one injection and repeated phototherapy. In a mouse model, it showed no toxicity while the cancer was completely removed.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/nrco-cwl011121.php):

> The research team developed a peptide-based photosensitizer that activates phototherapeutic effects only in cancer tissues by using the internalizing RGD peptide that can selectively penetrate and target cancer tissues, and by proper design for the modulation of its reaction to light. The phototherapeutic agent developed by the researchers was injected into a mouse model implanted with a tumor, and the photosensitizer was stored around the tumor and was continuously released for a long time, demonstrating the ability of selectively targeting the tumor with just a single injection around the cancerous tissues. "The developed phototherapeutic agent is expected to be useful in future phototherapy as it allows long-term repeated phototherapy without toxicity after only one injection around the cancer until the complete removal of the cancer, and has a simple formulation with a single component," he added.

## New research suggests that the use of terms like “Wuhan flu” and “Chinese virus” by conservative media outlets and Republican figures had a measurable impact on unconscious bias against Asian Americans. The study found that implicit bias increased after the use of such phrases went viral.

> Its surprising to me that this was written as an explicitly causal study. This is not an analysis of causation. They looked at difference in racial bias before and after March 8th. I think we can all agree that a change in media tone was not the only thing that happened last year.
> 
> They addressed this in the discussion section of the paper, but I still feel it was strongly irresponsible to frame this analysis as explicitly causal. It would have been more responsible to simply describe the temporal trend, and discuss multiple potential causal mechanisms, of which change in media tone would be one.
> 
> Edit: casual -> causal
> 
> Edit 2: My comments are NOT intended to discredit this study. My comments are NOT intended to discredit instruments used to measure implicit bias. My comments are NOT intended to falsify all the aims of the study nor invalidate the various results. 
> 
> The statistical analysis they performed support some of their conclusions, and the paper as a whole, deserves to be added to the evidence base on this field of study. However, these results should not be framed as evidence of causality, since the study was not structured in that way.
> 
> The temporal trends of implicit bias over time generally and stratified by political ideology are not rendered useless just because the study was not designed to show causality.
> 
> Racism IS a public health crisis, and deserves the attention of researchers of many disciplines.

## Twitter Bots Are a Major Source of Climate Disinformation. Researchers determined that nearly 9.5% of the users in their sample were likely bots. But those bots accounted for 25% of the total tweets about climate change on most days

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/twitter-bots-are-a-major-source-of-climate-disinformation/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Ftechnology+%28Topic%3A+Technology%29):

> Twitter accounts run by machines are a major source of climate change disinformation that might drain support from policies to address rising temperatures. Their paper published last week in the journal Climate Policy is part of an expanding body of research about the role of bots in online climate discourse. A paper published last year in the Proceedings of the International Conference SBP-BRiMS 2020 estimated that 35% of the accounts that tweeted about climate during the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland were bots.

## New research from McMaster University has found that psychiatric help for mothers with postpartum depression results in healthy changes in the brains of their babies.

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article. (ERROR: <class 'smmryapi.SmmryAPIException'>)

`/u/goodredditer` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l2qifj/new_research_from_mcmaster_university_has_found/):

> This is so important. Studies have demonstrated that the long-term impact of positive changes in mothers have impacts on their children's long term mental health, physical health, and well-being. To me, this implies that the potential impact of this intervention over the long term (think decades or generations) will be even greater. So cool!
> 
> Abstract from the original paper below:
> 
> ### Background
> 
> Exposure to maternal postpartum depression (PPD) increases the risk for emotion regulatory and psychiatric problems in offspring. This study aimed to determine if maternal cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PPD improves infant emotion regulatory capacity.
> 
> ### Methods
> 
> Participants were 40 infants of mothers with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder matched 1:1–40 healthy control infants of nondepressed mothers on infant age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Mothers with PPD received nine weeks of group CBT. Dyads were tested at two time points. Visit 1 occurred following the first CBT session (baseline visit for control infants). Visit 2 took place after CBT (nine weeks post‐baseline for controls). At both visits, infant emotion regulation was assessed using resting‐state frontal electroencephalography alpha asymmetry (FAA), heart rate variability (HRV), and maternal and partner ratings of orientation or regulation behaviors (infant behavior questionnaire‐revised \[short form\]). Changes in maternal characteristics (depression, bonding, and emotion regulation) from pretreatment to posttreatment were examined to determine if they explained infant changes.
> 
> ### Results
> 
> At Visit 1, infants of women with PPD exhibited poorer emotion regulation relative to the healthy control infants. At Visit 2, following maternal PPD treatment, infants exhibited improved emotion regulation (shifted from right to left FAA \[*p* = .01, *d* = 0.60\], increased HRV \[*p* = .003, *d =* 0.56\], mother \[*p* = .015, *d* = 0.29\] and partner \[*p* = .049, *d* = 0.35\] reported orientation or regulation behaviors) such that they no longer differed from the healthy control infants. Changes in maternal characteristics did not appear to account for these changes.
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> Treating PPD may promote adaptive changes in physiological and behavioral systems underlying infant emotion regulation.

## New Maps Show Forests Absorb Twice as Much Carbon as They Release Each Year. The continued destruction of the world’s largest tropical forests - 11.9 million hectares of tropical tree cover was lost in 2019 alone - makes them less powerful carbon sinks.

> Primary forest loss was 2.8% higher in 2019 than the year before and has remained stubbornly high for the last two decades despite efforts to halt deforestation. At least 1.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are associated with 2019 primary forest loss, equivalent to the annual emissions of 400 million cars.

## Those who recover from COVID-19 are protected against the virus for at least six months, and likely much longer. Antibodies produced months after the infection showed increased ability to block SARS-CoV-2, as well as its mutated versions such as the South African variant.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w):

> Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response.
