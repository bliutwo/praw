## 5- to 9-year-old children chose to save multiple dogs over 1 human, and valued the life of a dog as much as a human. By contrast, almost all adults chose to save 1 human over even 100 dogs. The view that humans are morally more important than animals appears later and may be socially acquired.

## ‘Poverty line’ concept debunked - mainstream thinking around poverty is outdated because it places too much emphasis on subjective notions of basic needs and fails to capture the full complexity of how people use their incomes. Poverty will mean different things in different countries and regions.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aston.ac.uk/latest-news/poverty-line-concept-debunked-new-machine-learning-model):

> New mathematical model uses machine learning to challenge conventional notions of a fixed international poverty line. Mathematicians have used machine learning to develop a new model for measuring poverty in different countries that junks old notions of a fixed 'poverty line'. "No-one has ever used machine learning to decode multidimensional poverty before," said lead researcher Dr Amit Chattopadhyay of Aston University's College of Engineering and Physical Sciences.

## Liberals are prone to chronic second guessing, while conservatives tend to go with their gut - Politically conservative individuals tend to have greater confidence in their judgments, while political liberals have a tendency to second guess themselves.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/study-liberals-are-prone-to-chronic-second-guessing-while-conservatives-tend-to-go-with-their-gut-58904):

> Politically conservative individuals tend to have greater confidence in their judgments, while political liberals have a tendency to second guess themselves, according to new research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. "Basically, regardless of what the task was, conservatives were more confident that they were answering correctly, and liberals were less so," Ruisch told PsyPost. "For people whose job it is to motivate action among liberals and conservatives, these findings might also be worth bearing in mind. Liberals seem to kind of be 'chronic second guessers,' which can decrease their confidence that they hold the right answer. So to get liberals to act, you might need to undercut this baseline tendency towards extensive - and possibly excessive - deliberation."

## A bit of stress might not be so good for us after all: The study found even mild stress may harm most people’s executive functions—mental skills such as self-control, focused attention, working memory and problem solving.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ubc.ca/2020/12/18/a-bit-of-stress-might-not-be-so-good-for-us-after-all-ubc-study/):

> "There is this idea that for challenging cognitive tasks, you will do better if you're a bit stressed rather than calm," says Dr. Diamond, professor of neuroscience in the department of psychiatry and member of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health at UBC. "But our study found that stress, even if it's really mild, is actually not good for most people and hurts their executive function performance. A positive effect of stress is true only for a subset of people and even then, only if the stress is extremely mild." "It's also important to recognize that many people might not be experiencing the best self-control or logical reasoning at this time because of high stress levels, and we should give one another a little slack." While there was a subset of people with a specific form of a gene whose executive functions improved, other investigators who imposed slightly more stress found no benefit to that group from stress.

## Vietnam War-era U.S. bombings of Cambodia still contribute to underdevelopment and poverty today. Bombs on softer high‐fertility land were less likely to explode, thus leaving dangerous unexploded bombs in the most fertile lands. Counterintuitively, the most fertile land becomes the least productive

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12577):

> How does past political violence impact subsequent development and practices, long beyond the life of the regime that perpetrated violence? Prior research focuses on physical destruction without much attention to weapons left behind in conflict zones. Short‐term adjustments in agricultural methods accumulate to long‐term underdevelopment and poverty. Counterintuitively, the most fertile land becomes the least productive.
