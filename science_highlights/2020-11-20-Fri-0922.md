## By fostering visitors' feelings of ownership of a public resource, visitors will feel more responsible, and donate more money. Visitors who saw a "Welcome to YOUR Park" instead of “the Park” sign felt more ownership and responsibility, were more likely to pick up trash, and donate 34% more.

> I don’t understand why people litter. I’m from NYC, growing up littering was the norm, but it always bothered me. Maybe my parents influenced me since they weren’t from there?
> 
> The other day I was at a playground with my grandkids and my daughter’s dad and I picked up a bottle someone had discarded on the ground. 
> 
> My daughter’s dad literally shamed me for picking up trash, going “oh look she’s cleaning up.”
> 
> He seems to be getting early onset dementia, so I didn’t say anything because he wouldn’t remember anyway, but it just made me realize how normalized littering was/is to people in NYC and other places, and I don’t get it.

## Actual COVID-19 Cases Could Be 6 Times Greater Than Official Figures. A newly modelled estimate from the United States, Australia, Canada, South Korea and 11 countries in Europe suggests official figures could be struggling to capture the full scale of the outbreak.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-actual-number-of-covid-19-cases-is-far-higher-than-official-figures-in-many-nations):

> According to their results, at the end of August the population infection rate was, on average, six times higher than reported cases. In South Korea, the actual number of infections was found to be 2.6 times higher than reported figures, whereas in Italy, the 'backcasted' number of cases was a startling 17.5 times higher. Most nations have taken far fewer tests among their populations, which suggests the number of people globally who have been infected with COVID-19 is likely several times greater than official figures.

> Makes sense. Especially since they were encouraging younger healthier people with symptoms to just stay home and quarantine rather than go out and use scarce resources for testing and treatment.

## People who value the moral principle of authority (over fairness) show less support for social justice movements like BLM, suggesting an ethical trade-off between the two foundations of human morality.

> I'd argue that there is no "moral principle of authority".  Yes, we need authority to provide stability, but it should be viewed as a necessary component of an otherwise moral society, and not as a moral principle in and of itself.

## Plate tectonics may have begun a billion years earlier than thought

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2260500-plate-tectonics-may-have-begun-a-billion-years-earlier-than-thought/):

> Plate tectonics may have begun 4 billion years ago, almost a billion years earlier than we thought, according to a new analysis of ancient rocks. Many argue that Earth was too hot at the time for plate tectonics in its modern form. Today, Earth's crust is divided into several dozen rigid plates, which move around over millions of years.

## Scientists reprogram immune B cells using CRISPR to produce same broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies found in rare HIV patients. These engineered immune cells elicit broad response to HIV in mice, offering hope for vaccine or functional cure against numerous strains of the fast-evolving virus.

## Scientists have shown for the first time a link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an often fatal lung condition, and the gut microbiome. They found the gut microbiome could now be considered when looking for new therapeutic targets to help treat lung disease

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/ci-gml111820.php):

> Research led by the Centenary Institute, the University of Technology Sydney and the University of Queensland has shown for the first time a link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an often fatal lung condition, and the gut microbiome. The study's researchers believe that the altered gut microbiome found in COPD patients could also support the gut as a potential target for new treatments. "The 'gut-lung axis' describes the common immune system of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. This means that activity in the gut can impact activity in the lung. Our COPD findings suggest that the gut microbiome should now also be considered when looking for new therapeutic targets to help treat lung disease," said Professor Hansbro.

> Hopefully we can further learn what foods to eat to properly cultivate our gut micro biome, thus preventing the disease in the first place.
