## Scientists have found that three consecutive nights of sleep loss can have a negative impact on both mental and physical health. Sleep deprivation can lead to an increase in anger, frustration, and anxiety.

> >	…found the biggest jump in symptoms appeared after just one night of sleep loss. The number of mental and physical problems steadily got worse, peaking on day three. At that point, research shows the human body got relatively used to repeated sleep loss. But that all changed on day six, when participants reported that the severity of physical symptoms was at its worst.

> Edit2: just finishing out a twelve hour day, 14 hr day actually with the breaks included. Just enough time to head home shower and sleep if I can. This isn’t gonna help my sleep but dammit I need the money. And that’s why corporations will keep pushing you. As soon as I get caught up on bills no more extra hours.

## Scientists developed a special type of quantum computer known as a programmable quantum simulator capable of operating with 256 quantum bits, or “qubits.” "The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system."

> Once again these numbers of possible states are not very meaningful. The number of states are large only if you can meaningfully entangle every qubit with every other qubit, which is highly unlikely to be the case because the atoms are arranged in a grid. Meaningful entanglements are probably just around nearby neighbors. There also the problem of keeping coherence across all the qubits. The devils are in the details.

> Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic research, but physicists don't overhype them using meaningless comparisons like the number of atoms in the universe.

## Americans living with HIV have the same life expectancy as those without. Suicide rates, however, remain high.

Summary of [original article](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-0065):

> Reproducible Research Statement:Study protocol and statistical code: Available from Dr. Edwards. Data set: Detailed mortality files and census data were provided by NCHS. Researchers may request access to these restricted-use files through the NCHS Research Data Center. HIV cohort data were provided by NA-ACCORD. Any investigator who can be reasonably expected to be able to conduct the proposed work is eligible to submit a concept proposal to NA-ACCORD, as detailed on the NA-ACCORD website.

## Cauliflowers form fractals because they are failed flowers

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6551/192):

> Skip to main content AbstractThroughout development, plant meristems regularly produce organs in defined spiral, opposite, or whorl patterns. How such a fractal, self-similar organization emerges from developmental mechanisms has remained elusive. Combining experimental analyses in an Arabidopsis thaliana cauliflower-like mutant with modeling, we found that curd self-similarity arises because the meristems fail to form flowers but keep the "Memory" of their transient passage in a floral state.

`/u/MarshmallowSnugglez` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oh98md/cauliflowers_form_fractals_because_they_are/):

> On behalf of cauliflowers, that’s a little offensive.

## A study found evidence that mothers’ pretend play may protect children from behavioral difficulties two years later. The study additionally found that mothers with anxiety engage in less pretend play with their children, and their children partake in less pretend play, too.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/mothers-with-anxiety-engage-in-less-pretend-play-with-their-children-study-finds-61390):

> The study additionally found that mothers with anxiety engage in less pretend play with their children, and their children partake in less pretend play, too. The findings revealed that mothers with greater anxiety engaged in less pretend play with their children during the free play interaction. "It suggests that supporting mothers to engage in pretend play with their children could be a target for interventions aimed at families affected by maternal anxiety and depression." The researchers say that future studies will be important to further understand the interplay between maternal anxiety and depression, mothers' engagement in pretend play, and children's development.

> Mammals actually have a dedicated play "circuit" within the brain which just emphasizes how fundamental it is to human development. If you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend starting with Dr. Jaak Panksepp's work on the [neurobiology of play](https://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/2-3-interview-science-of-brain-jaak-panksepp.pdf).

## The Vagus Nerve May Carry Serotonin Along the Gut-Brain Axis. SSRIs may activate vagus nerve dependent gut-to-brain serotonin signaling.

Summary of [original article](https://www-psychologytoday-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201910/the-vagus-nerve-may-carry-serotonin-along-the-gut-brain-axis?amp):

> In recent years, researchers at McMaster University's Brain-Body Institute have been investigating a possible link between SSRI antidepressant medications, serotonin levels in the gut, and the role that vagus nerve stimulation might play in boosting gut-to-brain transport of serotonin, which appears to rely on the vagus nerve. "The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve and is the main afferent pathway connecting the gut to the brain. The vagus nerve can transmit signals to the brain resulting in a reduction in depressive behavior as evidenced by the long-term beneficial effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus in patients with intractable depression." Many readers have told me that the vagus nerve illustration above triggered an Aha! moment of realizing-and visualizing for the first time-how the vagus nerve wanders along the gut-brain axis.

## Researchers have designed a fabric that looks like an everyday T-shirt—but can cool the body by nearly 5°C

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/new-mirror-fabric-can-cool-wearers-nearly-5-c?utm_campaign=SciMag&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Reddit):

> Now, researchers have designed a fabric that looks like an everyday T-shirt, but can cool the body by nearly 5°C. They say the technology, if mass produced, could help people around the world protect themselves against rising temperatures caused by climate change. Human skin, unlike many of the clothes we wear, naturally emits MIR. In 2017, Stanford University researchers designed a fabric that lets MIR from the human body pass directly through it, cooling the wearer by about 3° C. But to work, the fabric had to be very thin-only 45 micrometers, or about one-third the thickness of a lightweight linen dress shirt. When the researchers measured his skin temperature, the side under the new fabric was almost 5° C cooler than the side under the cotton, they report today in Science.
