## As interactions increasingly take place online, people find information that confirms their existing beliefs, making them less willing to listen to alternatives. This exacerbates filter bubbles and explains why public debates become polarized as people become impervious to opposing arguments.

> You have to wonder how much social media companies have a part in this. If they build algorithms to present information similar to what the user has been viewing in the past, surely that can be a large part of what drives such unbalanced viewing. Facebook, Reddit, Amazon and all sorts of companies try this with the aim of keeping their "customers" more engaged, which keeps them coming back to the site.

## People’s moral foundations can predict their compliance with staying at home, wearing masks, and social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caring and fairness are morals that predict compliance with all three public health measures.

> My dad thinks it's a conspiracy and all of the people wearing masks are sheep. He thinks the world is run by satanic jews. I don't know that he lacks empathy, more that he is just crazy.

## In the US, states typically pay for prison while counties determine sentencing. A natural experiment whereby the cost burden of juvenile incarceration was placed on counties led to a stark drop in incarceration. This suggests that mass incarceration in the US is in part due to misaligned incentives.

## Climate ‘apocalypse’ fears stopping people having children. In the first study of its kind, people cite their reasons, in a world that has changed over recent decades due to global temperatures increasing and the ice caps melting, as an extreme concern for the well-being of any future kids

## Earth Is a Whole Lot Closer to Our Galaxy's Supermassive Black Hole Than We Thought

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/earth-is-significantly-closer-to-our-galaxy-s-supermassive-black-hole-than-we-thought):

> Not only is it closer to the galactic centre - and the supermassive hole therein, Sagittarius A* - it's orbiting at a faster clip. It's relatively easy to map the two-dimensional coordinates of stars and other cosmic objects, but the distances to those objects is a lot harder to figure out. A good recent example of this is the red giant star Betelgeuse, which turned out to be closer to Earth than previous measurements suggested.

`/u/Purplekeyboard` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k229bv/earth_is_a_whole_lot_closer_to_our_galaxys/):

> >In 1985, the International Astronomical Union defined the distance to the galactic centre as 27,700 light-years. Last year, the GRAVITY collaboration recalculated it and found it closer, just 26,673 light-years away.
> 
> 4% is not "a whole lot".

## E.P.A.’s Final Deregulatory Rush Runs Into Open Staff Resistance

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/climate/epa-trump-biden.html):

> "Human subjects research is the most predictive data for establishing the human health impact from environmental exposures," Dr. Sinks wrote, adding, "Any rule or guidance that diminishes or removes high quality research from consideration in rule making results in poorly developed rules." The rule is expected to leave in place a 2012 standard on fine soot from smokestacks and tailpipes, known as PM 2.5, ignoring the E.P.A.'s own scientists, who wrote last year that the existing rule contributes to about 45,000 deaths per year from respiratory diseases, and that tightening it could save about 10,000 of those lives. Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard and a former adviser to the Obama administration, called the rule a "Little I.E.D.," referring to an improvised explosive device, or roadside bomb, aimed at slowing a Biden administration's plans to overturn Mr. Trump's rules.

`/u/Artheon` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k299yp/epas_final_deregulatory_rush_runs_into_open_staff/):

> So the rule states that data must be made public for it to be given weight... And the EPA states it doesn't have the expertise to keep personal information private therefore the rule itself isn't the problem, it's the capabilities of the EPA. It's scary these "scientists" cannot come up with a solution. A simple Google search can provide a list of hundreds of companies that provide tools to do exactly what they are saying they cannot do.

## Americans on the left and right are engaged in a culture war, and even intimate family gatherings are subject to tensions. Politically diverse Thanksgiving dinners were 24 minutes shorter than politically uniform ones, finds new study replicating a previous one that found them 35–70 minutes shorter.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239988):

> Our primary goal was to test whether politically diverse Thanksgiving dinners were shorter than politically uniform ones in the years 2018 and 2019. Using a complementary method to that used in previous research, we found little evidence to support the notion that politically diverse dinners were shorter than politically uniform ones, and we found positive support for the conclusion that diverse dinners tend to be of similar duration as politically uniform ones. These analyses also found that dinners at home and dinners at other people's homes were several hours longer than dinners at restaurants; the earlier the start time, the longer the dinner; dinners with more people were longer than dinners with fewer people; males reported longer dinners than females; and white people reported shorter dinners than non-white people.
