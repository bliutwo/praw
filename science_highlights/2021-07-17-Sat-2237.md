> That’s what they do. That’s why you don’t ever see them. Crows/Ravens do it too.

> Pretty amazing.  Glad it seems to have worked.   The outside power source seems like it could be a bit tricky but it's an option that hopefully will save lives.

## 57.8% of healthcare professionals suffered mental disorders during COVID-19 first wave. The research indicates that the moral courage shown by healthcare professionals to face the first wave was one of the factors that increased the risk of suffering from mental illness.

> I work in healthcare and did so through the pandemic. What’s happening now is crisis that is being underreported. Nurses, providers, and techs are leaving in droves. Staffing is a real issue. My hospital offers $100 for RNs to help cover shifts, and $20 for techs but very cone in to help. 
> 
> Last night my charge nurses gets on the PA in the ED, “Any 3 to 11 RNs willing to stay overnight? We could use the help.” No one stayed. The ED lobby was just about full with 23 patients waiting, and another 120 in the ED being seen. 
> 
> This isn’t sustainable. Most of my colleagues say the work is no longer worth it.

## Abnormal hot and cold temperatures account for more than five million excess deaths a year across the world, according to an international study which found 9.43 per cent of global deaths from 2000 to 2019 were attributable to cold and hot temperatures

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00081-4/fulltext#%20):

> This study estimated the global burden of mortality associated with non-optimal temperatures at a spatial resolution of 0·5° × 0·5°, and explored the temporal change from 2000 to 2019. GBD 2019 estimated that the mortality burden for hot temperatures is higher than the mortality burden for cold temperatures in Southern Asia, which is opposite to the findings in our study and a previous report based on daily observational data of deaths. As a result, the global temperature-related mortality burden might have been underestimated, as supported by our analysis showing that the relative risk of mortality from both hot and cold temperatures was lower for the seven countries in GBD 2019 than for the remaining countries in the MCC network.

`/u/TrevorBOB9` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/olz3mt/abnormal_hot_and_cold_temperatures_account_for/):

> The title is just a lie. The study says that non-optimal temperatures “*were associated with*” 5 million deaths per year, not that they “account for” them as the title says. Proving temperature to be a direct contributor to all of those deaths wasn’t their point, what they meant to do and what they did was show the statistical correlation across time and space.

## Australian researchers create quantum microscope that can see the impossible

Summary of [original article](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2021/06/australian-researchers-create-quantum-microscope-can-see-impossible):

> In a major scientific leap, University of Queensland researchers have created a quantum microscope that can reveal biological structures that would otherwise be impossible to see. "The quantum entanglement in our microscope provides 35 per cent improved clarity without destroying the cell, allowing us to see minute biological structures that would otherwise be invisible." Image above left: UQ team researchers Catxere Casacio, Warwick Bowen, Lars Madsen and Waleed Muhammad aligning the quantum microscope.

## The coronavirus pandemic has worsened tinnitus for many sufferers

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-worsened-tinnitus-for-many-sufferers-new-research-149598):

> Our recent study has also found that the pandemic has worsened tinnitus for many individuals. Of the respondents who had not had COVID-19, 67% reported their tinnitus stayed the same during the pandemic, worsened for 32%, and improved for 1% of respondents. Other factors found to have worsened participants' tinnitus during the pandemic included health-related concerns, social distancing measures, lifestyle changes, and reduced exercise levels.

`/u/b_a_b_a_r` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ombfb3/the_coronavirus_pandemic_has_worsened_tinnitus/):

> I didn’t get Covid-19 but my tinnitus started after I was in a car accident a month ago. Silence no longer exists for me, it’s no joke.

## Just 7 percent of our genome is uniquely shared with other humans, and not shared by other early ancestors. The researchers also found that an even smaller fraction of our genome — just 1.5 percent — is both unique to our species and shared among all people alive today

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/just-7-percent-dna-unique-modern-humans-study-shows-rcna1445):

> What makes humans unique? Scientists have taken another step toward solving an enduring mystery with a new tool that may allow for more precise comparisons between the DNA of modern humans and that of our extinct ancestors. Just 7 percent of our genome is uniquely shared with other humans, and not shared by other early ancestors, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. Four years later, geneticist Joshua Akey co-authored a paper showing that modern humans carry some remnants of Neanderthal DNA. Since then, scientists have continued to refine techniques to extract and analyze genetic material from fossils.

`/u/Shinoobie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/om680x/just_7_percent_of_our_genome_is_uniquely_shared/):

> There is a fascinating lecture from a primatologist named Robert Sapolsky where he explores what makes humans different from other animals. I recommend both this lecture and really his entire Stanford series on human behavior that you can watch for free online.
