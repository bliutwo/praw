## According to a study published in Psychological Reports, a workplaceâ€™s tendency for bullshit does not go unnoticed by its employees. In fact, bullshit in the workplace can even be measured with a new scale called the Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/researchers-explore-employee-perceptions-of-bullshit-in-the-workplace-with-the-organizational-bullshit-perception-scale-61415):

> Bullshit in the workplace can even be measured with a new scale called the Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale. Bullshit in the workplace - or organizational bullshit - has been speculated to have a negative impact on both employees and organizations. The researchers created the Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale to measure the extent that employees perceive bullshit within their organization.

## Minimum wage increases lead to lower recidivism for released prisoners. The effects are primarily driven by a reduction in property and drug crimes when minimum wages go up.

Summary of [original article](http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2021/07/03/jhr.58.5.1220-11398R1.abstract):

> For released prisoners, the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credits can influence their ability to find employment and their potential wages relative to illegal sources of income, affecting the probability they are reincarcerated. Using administrative prison release records we identify the effects of state variation in minimum wages and EITC policies on recidivism. We find that a minimum wage increase of $0.50 reduces the probability an individual returns to prison within 3 years by 2.15%; these reductions come mainly from returns for property and drug crimes.

> You mean when released prisoners have the ability to actually survive outside of prison, they don't resort to the same things they did before? Who knew?

## Every spot of urban green space counts - "An international study of parks and gardens finds even the humble roadside verge plays an important role in the environment and for our health."

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/every-spot-urban-green-space-counts):

> The study took soil samples from different types of urban green spaces and comparable neighbouring natural ecosystems in 56 cities from 17 countries across six continents. The urban green spaces studied included Olympic Park in Beijing, the University of Queensland campus in Brisbane, Retiro in Madrid, Spain, and the park surrounding Uppsala Castle in Uppsala, Sweden. With 68 per cent of the global population set to live in cities by 2050, the study suggests that urban green spaces are critically important for promoting mental and physical wellbeing.

> Maybe that partly explains the growth of [mini-parks / pocket parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_park) in cities around the world. People love to be in green spaces, even if they're small spaces.

## Marijuana legalization linked to temporary decrease in opioid-related emergency visits

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/uop-mll070821.php):

> Published today in the journal Health Economics, the study shows that even after the temporary decline wears off, recreational cannabis laws are not associated with increases in opioid-related emergency department visits. Although the downturn in emergency department visits for opioids doesn't persist past six months, Drake said that it is encouraging that visits also don't increase above baseline after recreational marijuana laws are adopted. "Cannabis can provide pain relief for persons using opioids, but cannabis ultimately is not a treatment for opioid use disorder. Still, this is good news for state policymakers. States can fight the opioid epidemic by expanding access to opioid use disorder treatment and by decreasing opioid use with recreational cannabis laws. These policies aren't mutually exclusive; rather, they're both a step in the right direction."

> Not in my experience; I've seen lots of people who would rather use cannabis than touch opioids at all and that's what they do, for chronic back pain to pain after reconstructive surgery.

> Are they distinct and co-occuring or are they (typically) occurring sequentially? I was unable to figure out that information from the article. 
> 
> It's not uncommon in the marine environment for organisms to have an asexual (or hermaphroditic) stage; the pelagic tunicates are my prime example of displaying both sexual & asexual reproduction, as well as self-fertilization of an egg (which to me amusingly then develops into the asexual, colonial stage). 
> 
> Im curious if its an evolved "gene mixing" adaptation, an adaptation allowing a specific subset of most-fit organisms to pass on their genes in limiting conditions (as the researchers had to induce the different sexual stages with nutrient limiation), or something else.
> 
> 
> Im just a PhD student in marine sciences, I'm aware im often wrong and misinformed.

## Study: Regular coffee consumption linked to lower risk of COVID-19 infection

Summary of [original article](https://whdh.com/news/study-regular-coffee-consumption-linked-to-lower-risk-of-covid-19-infection/):

> Those who drink coffee on a regular basis have a lower risk of becoming infected with COVID-19, according to a new study. A study conducted by researchers at Northwestern University in Chicago found that the "Habitual consumption of one or more cups of coffee per day was associated with about a 10% decrease in risk of COVID-19" in comparison to consuming less than one cup. Processed meat consumption was said to be associated with higher risk of COVID-19 but red meat consumption presented no risk, researchers added.
