## New studies suggest people with blood type O may have a lower risk of COVID-19 infection and reduced likelihood of severe outcomes, including organ complications, if they do get sick. Meanwhile, individuals with type A and AB may have increased risk of severe clinical outcomes.

## Dutch woman dies after catching COVID-19 twice, the first reported reinfection death, raising serious questions about how long immunity and antibodies can last. Her immune system was compromised. The case was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/dutch-woman-dies-after-catching-covid-19-twice-the-first-reported-reinfection-death-1.5144351):

> An elderly Dutch woman has become the first known person to die from catching COVID-19 twice, according to experts, raising serious questions about how long immunity and antibodies can last. Two days into chemotherapy treatment - 59 days after the start of the first COVID-19 episode - the woman developed fever, cough and difficulty breathing. A 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong was the first person reported to have caught the virus twice.

## New species of water bear uses fluorescent ‘shield’ to survive lethal UV radiation

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/new-species-water-bear-uses-fluorescent-shield-survive-lethal-uv-radiation):

> Now, scientists have discovered a new species of tardigrade that can endure ultraviolet light so lethal, it is regularly used to get rid of hard-to-kill viruses and bacteria. The researchers realized they had found a new species of tardigrade, part of the Paramacrobiotus genus. Fluorescent pigments, likely located under the tardigrades' skin, transformed the UV light into harmless blue light, the team reports today in.

## New research suggests that a strain of coronavirus that has recently alarmed the swine industry may have the potential to spread to humans as well. The coronavirus strain, known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), emerged from bats and has infected swine herds throughout China.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/uonc-scr101320.php):

> The virus' potential threat to people was demonstrated in lab tests showing SADS-CoV efficiently replicated in human airway and intestinal cells. According to Edwards, SADS-CoV shows a higher rate of growth in intestinal cells found in the human gut, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which primarily infects lung cells. "It is impossible to predict if this virus, or a closely related HKU2 bat strain, could emerge and infect human populations. However, the broad host range of SADS-CoV, coupled with an ability to replicate in primary human lung and enteric cells, demonstrates potential risk for future emergence events in human and animal populations."

## A new study investigates the secret of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's unusual success: its transmissibility, or how it manages to get from host to host. The dominant mode, it turns out, changes according to environmental conditions.

Summary of [original article](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/020063/aerosols-vs-droplets):

> To understand how the novel coronavirus manages to persist in circumstances in which the flu virus fails, Zhu, Zhao and colleagues modeled different temperatures and relative humidities along a continuum from hot and dry to cold and humid in typical indoor spaces, where the virus is distributed by normal speech and breathing - and, according to the paper, where people "Only sneeze or cough into a tissue or their elbows." To these scenarios they added emerging knowledge about the highly contagious microbe; in particular, how long it remains infectious outside a host. In addition to its ability to travel farther, the virus is particularly persistent in cooler temperatures, remaining "Infectious from several minutes to longer than a day in various environments," according to several published studies. "Combined with our study, we think we can maybe provide design guidelines for the optimal filtering for facial masks," said Zhao, adding that the research could be used to quantify real exposure to the virus - how much virus could land on one's body over a certain period of exposure.

> Winter is on its way. And in this year of coronavirus, with it comes the potential for a second wave of COVID-19. Add in flu season and our tendency to head inside and close our windows to the cold, wet weather, and it appears the next several months are going to present us with new health challenges.

> UC Santa Barbara researchers Yanying Zhu and Lei Zhao hope to arm people with better knowledge of how SARS-CoV-2 spreads as the seasons change. Their new study investigates the secret of this virus’s unusual success: its transmissibility, or how it manages to get from host to host. The dominant mode, it turns out, changes according to environmental conditions.
> 
> “Back at the beginning of April a lot of people were wondering if COVID would go away in the summer, in the warmer weather,” said Zhu, a professor of mechanical engineering and one of the authors of a paper that appears in the journal Nano Letters. “And so we started to think about it from a heat transfer point of view, because that’s what our expertise is.

## People’s attachment to the wilderness is linked to the fulfillment of basic psychological needs, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/10/peoples-attachment-to-the-wilderness-is-linked-to-the-fulfillment-of-basic-psychological-needs-study-finds-58254):

> A study published in Environment and Behavior suggests that people feel attached to wilderness landscapes due to nature's ability to fulfill the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Study authors Adam C. Landon and his team speculated that it may have something to do with the fulfillment of psychological needs. Despite the limitations, the study offers strong evidence that human connection to nature is linked to the fulfillment of basic psychological needs.
