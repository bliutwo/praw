> Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!
> 
> **Didn't we already know there was water on the moon?** Short answer: yes.  Water on the moon in the form of ice has been known for decades, but in very specific circumstances of some craters in the south pole that never get sunlight.  The trick is the daytime temperatures on the moon (remember, a day lasts two weeks there- as in, sunrise to sunset) reaches above the boiling temperature of water, so until now it was thought the water outside these regions would have evaporated long ago.
> 
> **What's new this time?** Scientists used a cool instrument called SOFIA, the world's only flying observatory, which is a telescope on a modified Boeing 747 and flies above 99% of the water vapor in the atmosphere and thus can make this measurement even though you can't from Earth's surface. (Full disclosure, one of the coolest things I've done was get to ride on SOFIA last year, as far south as Antarctica!  I wrote about it [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/riding-along-with-a-stratospheric-telescope/) if you're interested in what it's like.) They basically demonstrated using its unique observation capabilities that water is also present in the sunny areas, not just the southern craters, so will hopefully be way easier for future astronauts to access.  SOFIA is basically capable of mapping the molecular existence of water at [Clavius crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavius_\(crater\)) (fun coincidence: where they had the lunar base in *2001: A Space Odyssey*!), and found it a lot of those sunlit places where no one was really expecting it.  It's also not literally water droplets or chunks of ice, mind, but a fairly low concentration, likely from micro-meteorites or the solar wind- they say it's the *equivalent of a 12 oz bottle over a cubic meter of soil*, and NASA on the press conference right now can't confirm how useful that'll be and how prevalent this is all over.
> 
> **What gives?  Is this that big a deal if we already knew there is water?** I mean, on the one hand, yes.  Water is obviously super important for future explorations and is really expensive to send up, so it'll be really useful for future lunar astronauts if it's more accessible.  Also, it is intriguing in terms of how prevalent water might be in other areas in space that are currently thought to be harsh environments incapable of having it.  On the other hand... this is my personal opinion, but NASA *does* like to sometimes get a splash in the press because they are a government agency that is currently looking at a lot of budget cuts for a lot of their science. Specifically, SOFIA [was canceled in the most recent proposed NASA budget](https://spacenews.com/nasas-sofia-airborne-observatory-faces-termination-again/), and it's not a cheap instrument. (I actually had a random astronomer I've never met chastising me for my article about how cool SOFIA was last year, which was weird, so this is a not-insignificant sentiment.) Obviously, a lot of scientists really disagree with this assessment of how important SOFIA is, as it's the best way to do infrared astronomy right now that we have, so it's good to have a press conference that will inevitably have a bit more press coverage than just a press release to highlight the cool things only SOFIA can do.
> 
> TL;DR- looks like there's more water than we expected on the moon, and hopefully that'll be useful for future astronauts!

## Tackling climate change seemed expensive. Then COVID happened. | the money countries have put on the table to address COVID-19 far outstrips the low-carbon investments that scientists say are needed in the next five years to avoid climate catastrophe — by about an order of magnitude.

> We tend to talk about climate mitigation in terms of ***cost***, which is an outdated way of thinking.  Early economic literature assumed that any country reducing CO2 emissions would only incur local *costs*, because any benefits of preventing global warming would be *delayed and global*.  These early assumptions influenced other academic disciplines, and formed the framework for everything from international climate negotiations to the beliefs of the layperson ([Stern 2015, section 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/)).  But current evidence suggests that **the** ***immediate*** **and** ***local*** **benefits of reducing fossil fuel combustion outweigh costs**, regardless of what other countries do*.*  
> 
> While early literature focused only on CO2 emissions, fossil fuel combustion generates other pollutants which impose immediate local costs.  Among these are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and others.  These pollutants contribute to four of the five leading causes of mortality in the United States. Considering these pollutants gives us a more complete picture of the societal cost of fossil fuels ([Shindell 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1343-0)).  Decreasing fossil fuel use reduces these other pollutants as well, generating significant additional social co-benefits ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031)).  
> 
> [Scovronick 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x#Abs1) finds that “The optimal climate policy has immediate and continual monetized global net benefits when accounting for health co-benefits. This overturns the findings from standard cost-benefit optimization models, which ignore health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century.”  [Vandyck 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9) ([fig. 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9/figures/6)) finds that the co-benefits of unilaterally reducing fossil fuel use exceed costs in most countries, even without accounting for benefits of avoiding climate damages.  The IMF ([Coady 2019, page 5](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509?fbclid=IwAR0qsx8ojaY62mmIOTmcWe9fh-Y4pw57ASxdvmU-hTSGRSwq5ALgQTm-Uog)) states that “Energy pricing reform therefore remains largely in countries own interest, given that about three quarters of the benefits are local.”

## In an agent-based simulation model, researchers find that even with the social and economic costs, social distancing measures are one of the "most effective" tools to prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2 when locally designed and adopted early.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/culture/social-distancing-covid-19-pandemic-fatigue):

> Whether people followed public health precautions made a significant difference too: The team estimated that 70 percent of the local population in Dane County and Milwaukee would need to adhere to social distancing measures to keep the pandemic in a "Steady state." In New York City, 85 percent of people would need to adhere to social distance measures - likely because the population density is high and many people rely on public transportation. Partial abstract: Background: Across the United States, various social distancing measures were implemented to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019. In NYC, implementing social distancing measures 1 week earlier would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 203 261 to 41 366 as of 31 May 2020, whereas a 1-week delay could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1 407 600.

## Women, particularly US-born Black women, in states with restrictive reproductive rights policies deliver more low birth weight babies & experience greater health inequities. The study provides evidence that reproductive rights policies play a critical role in advancing maternal & child health equity

Summary of [original article](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/when-reproductive-rights-are-less-restrictive-babies-are-born-healthier):

> Women, particularly US-born Black women, in states with restrictive reproductive rights policies deliver more low birth weight babies and experience greater health inequities, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. American women living in states with less restrictive reproductive rights policies are less likely to give birth to low-birth weight babies, according to a new study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier. The findings show that women, particularly US-born Black women, giving birth in states with less restrictive reproductive rights policies have a seven percent lower low-birth weight risk, compared to women in states with more restrictive policies.

Studies like this provide he reasoning why fighting for reproductive rights is a matter of universal consequence for a country.

## Strong state firearm laws are associated with fewer firearm homicides—both within the state where the laws are enacted and across state lines. Conversely, weak firearm laws in one state are linked to higher rates of homicides in neighboring states. Gun violence is a public health crisis in the US.

Summary of [original article](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/state-gun-laws-may-help-curb-violence-across-state-lines-study):

> Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health researchers find that strong state firearm laws are associated with fewer firearm homicides-both within the state where the laws are enacted and across state lines. The weak gun laws in Alabama and Georgia both contribute to higher homicide incidence in Alabama, but the stronger gun laws in Massachusetts temper the effect of the weak laws in New Hampshire. "Research has demonstrated that strong gun laws can reduce this burden. It's now becoming clear that weak gun laws don't only drive up gun violence within their own borders, they also affect gun violence in neighboring states."

> 
> Do we have a gun violence problem?  Yeah, probably,  but we need to look at solving the cause of the issues, not the symptoms.  
> 
> Making fair wages the norm, instituting universal healthcare and making gang violence less necessary by removing their income stream(what they fight for) would be far more effective than prohibition and allow for normal people to keep their weapons without being harassed for it.
