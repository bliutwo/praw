## Deep-Sea Coral Reefs Found Surviving in Ireland at The Edge of a Submarine Canyon

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/some-corals-in-the-deep-sea-are-thriving-but-scientists-are-worried-that-s-about-to-change):

> I have been studying the cold-water coral habitats off the coast of Ireland for a number of years, and have found these mounds of fossilised coral and sediment are incredibly varied. It's still unclear exactly how these huge mounds of coral deep below the surface of the ocean will respond to these changing conditions, especially since coral lives on such long time scales. Despite their slow-growing nature, colleagues and I have previously found these mounds have exhibited changes over just four years, with increased amounts of coral rubble and significant decreases in the coverage of a particular coral species.

> I highly recommend anyone interested in learning more about coral watch the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral. I legitimately teared up at seeing what's happening to our reefs, and they also talk about deep-sea coral and how they are surviving in the warmer waters around the world.

## Studies find that dangerous sexual behaviours are more likely to be performed by girls that have had a history of sexual abuse.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/tmsh-eno011421.php):

> New York, NY - Girls who are emotionally neglected or severely sexually abused early in their lives report riskier sexual behaviors during adolescence, Mount Sinai researchers report. The researchers identified four distinct patterns of neglect and sexual abuse in low-income, predominantly Black and/or Latina girls and young women that led to distinct trajectories of risky sexual behavior during adolescence. The girls who experienced moderate emotional neglect, which is the most common form of child maltreatment, may develop riskier behaviors than their peers who were not neglected because emotional neglect may interfere with the development of a secure bond with a parent and the self-esteem that bond produces; the lack of these may precipitate the onset and risky patterns of sexual behavior during middle adolescence, according to the study.

> The original title is "Profiles of Childhood Maltreatment: Associations with Sexual Risk Behavior during Adolescence in a Sample of Racial/Ethnic Minority Girls".
> 
> Maltreatment in the study includes more than sexual abuse, eg neglect.
> 
> Sexual Risk Behaviors are defined as "activity that will increase the probability that a person engaging in sexual activity with another person infected with a sexually transmitted infection will be infected or become pregnant, or make a partner pregnant."

## Link between gut microbes, diet and illnesses revealed. A large-scale international study using metagenomics and blood chemical profiling has uncovered a panel of 15 gut microbes associated with lower risks of common conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes

Summary of [original article](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/landmark-study-link-gut-microbes-diet-illnesses):

> A large-scale international study using metagenomics and blood chemical profiling has uncovered a panel of 15 gut microbes associated with lower risks of common conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It uncovered strong links between a person's diet, the microbes in their gut and their health. Nicola Segata, PhD, professor and principal investigator of the Computational Metagenomics Lab at the University of Trento, Italy and leader of the microbiome analysis in the study, said: "We were surprised to see such large, clear groups of what we informally call 'good' and 'bad' microbes emerging from our analysis. It is also exciting to see that microbiologists know so little about many of these microbes that they are not even named yet. This is now a big area of focus for us, as we believe they may open new insights in the future into how we could use the gut microbiome as a modifiable target to improve human metabolism and health."

> A large-scale international study using metagenomics and blood chemical profiling has uncovered a panel of 15 gut microbes associated with lower risks of common conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study has been published today in Nature Medicine from researchers at King’s, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the University of Trento, Italy, and health start-up company ZOE.
> 
> The PREDICT 1 (Personalized Responses to Dietary Composition Trial 1) analyzed detailed data on the composition of participants’ gut microbiomes, their dietary habits, and cardiometabolic blood biomarkers. It uncovered strong links between a person’s diet, the microbes in their gut (microbiome) and their health.
> 
> Researchers identified microbes that positively or negatively correlate ‘good’ and ‘bad’ with an individual’s risk of certain serious conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Surprisingly, the microbiome has a greater association to these markers than other factors, such as genetics. Some of the identified microbes are so novel that they have not yet been named.
> 
> The researchers defined a “healthy” diet as one that contained a mix of foods associated with a lower risk of chronic disease. They found that trial subjects who ate such a diet, or one rich in plants, were more likely to have high levels of specific ‘good’ gut microbes which are associated with a low risk of common illnesses. The researchers also found microbiome-based biomarkers of obesity as well as markers for cardiovascular disease and impaired glucose tolerance, which are key risk factors for COVID. These findings can be used to help create personalized eating plans designed specifically to improve one’s health.

## Evidence from Europe/ China suggests that mortality from COVID-19 is higher in men. A new US study (n=96,473) also found that men were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, and in hospital, have more complications, require ICU and ventilation, and have higher mortality, independent of age.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245556):

> Initial small studies from China indicated that males tend to experience higher disease severity as compared to females; and that among males, individuals with comorbidities had a higher likelihood of critical illness, however a similar association was not observed for females [4, 5]. This study was followed by several narrative reviews that summarized publicly available epidemiological data from Europe and China and speculated various behavioral and biological pathways that may be responsible for sex differences related to COVID-19 [6, 7]. More recently, further preliminary evidence of differential immune response to SARS-CoV-2 between males and females has been elucidated. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider in the Houston metropolitan area, we aimed to determine if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is interpedently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes. Houston precisely reflects the US sex distribution; proportion of females in Houston area is 50.1% compared to 50.8% for US. Though initial reports from China and Europe provided preliminary evidence of poor COVID-19 outcomes among males, to our knowledge data from large and diverse US metropolitan areas is lacking.

## People are less willing to share information that contradicts their pre-existing political beliefs and attitudes, even if they believe the information to be true. The phenomenon, selective communication, could be reinforcing political echo chambers.

## Clinical trial finds that vaping CBD-dominant cannabis doesn’t impair driving or produce significant cognitive or psychomotor impairment. Although CBD alone doesn’t lead to the feeling of euphoria, its calming effect makes it useful for treating anxiety, depression and seizures.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/cbd-doesnt-impair-driving-clinical-trial-finds/):

> Study participants who vaped a low dose of CBD-dominant cannabis did not exhibit impaired driving in a recent study aiming to measure the effects of less-examined cannabidiol compound. For the double-blind randomized clinical trial, researchers measured the extent to which 26 healthy participants who were occasional cannabis users weaved lanes, swerved and overcorrected on the road during 62-mile driving tests. Although cannabis is essentially regulated as a single product, the market has expanded to include concentrates, edibles and other products that are freely available, particularly in the U.S."I think we are now at a junction where you see that traditional cannabis will always be there, but there will be so much variation and so much spinoff of that particular plant, that probably legislation will have to follow and also regulation will have to follow and make sure that they are not prosecuting people in cars that have just smoked CBD rather than THC," Ramaekers said.
