## A small minority of “superspreader” points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants and religious establishments account for a large majority of COVID-19 infections and restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility.

> This is so common in complex systems where you see a few key factors dominating the outcome (kind of similar to Pareto distributions). Target your efforts there and the results are much more noticeable. Pandemic response has so far been focused on widespread linear-style adjustments whereas a key influencer approach with some kind of power law assumptions would be preferable (in my opinion).

## Conservatives tend to see expert evidence & personal experience as more equally legitimate than liberals, who put a lot more weight on scientific perspective. The study adds nuance to a common claim that conservatives want to hear both sides, even for settled science that’s not really up for debate.

## People with a greater sense of entitlement are less likely to comply with COVID-19 health guidelines, such as washing their hands more often and social distancing, according to a new study

> A study at least 25 years ago looked at this and found that surgeons were no more likely to wash their hands in a public restroom than most other professions, despite saying that they wash every time.  Social workers and health inspectors were the most likely group to actually wash.

## Social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also protected against many other diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. But susceptibility to those other diseases could be increasing, resulting in large outbreaks when masking and distancing stop

Summary of [original article](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/09/large-delayed-outbreaks-endemic-diseases-possible-following-covid-19-controls):

> The researchers used an epidemiological model based on historic RSV data and observations of the recent decline in RSV cases to examine the possible impact of COVID-19 NPIs on future RSV outbreaks in the United States and Mexico. These outbreaks were often delayed following the end of the NPI period, with peak cases projected to occur in many locations in winter 2021-22. "The decrease in cases of influenza and RSV - as well as the possible future increase we project - is arguably the broadest global impact of NPIs across a variety of human diseases that we've seen," said co-author Bryan Grenfell.

## To avoid the problem of inbreeding, female banded mongooses lead their groups into fights then try to mate with enemy males in the chaos of battle, new research shows. "Exploitative leadership" of this kind, which is also seen in human warfare, leads to frequent and damaging conflicts.

Summary of [original article](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_824622_en.html):

> The research team - led by the University of Exeter and the University of Cambridge - say females start fights for the genetic benefits of finding unrelated males. "Females start fights between groups to gain genetic benefits from mating with outsiders, while the males within their group - and the group as a whole - pay the costs." "Professor Rufus Johnstone of the University of Cambridge, who led the theoretical research, said:"Exploitative leadership in banded mongooses helps to explain why intergroup violence is so costly in this species compared to other animals.

## Computer model representing 98 million Americans' mobility in ten major U.S. cities during the pandemic pinpoints four high-risk "superspreader" sites: restaurants, gyms, hotels, and cafes. To slow Covid-19’s spread without full lockdown, the team recommends targeted occupancy caps in these places.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/study-pinpoints-high-risk-covid-19-locations):

> The study design - To determine how mobility patterns influence the coronavirus' spread, the team used a massive set of cell phone data collected by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates anonymous location data from mobile applications. "Our model's ability to capture the true case curve, despite only capturing changes in mobility, suggests that mobility played a really large role in determining the infection curve," study co-author Serina Chang, a researcher at Stanford University, said on the call. Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models which capture the effects of changes in mobility on virus spread. We introduce a metapopulation SEIR model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas.

## The amount of long-lived radioactive elements incorporated into a rocky planet as it forms may be a crucial factor in determining its future habitability, according to a new study. Radioactive decay drives plate tectonics and may be necessary for the planet to generate a magnetic field.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/planet-dynamos.html):

> The amount of long-lived radioactive elements incorporated into a rocky planet as it forms may be a crucial factor in determining its future habitability, according to a new study by an interdisciplinary team of scientists at UC Santa Cruz. "What we realized was that different planets accumulate different amounts of these radioactive elements that ultimately power geological activity and the magnetic field," Nimmo explained. The rare earth element europium, which is readily observed in stellar spectra, is created by the same process that makes the two longest-lived radioactive elements, thorium and uranium, so europium can be used as a tracer to study the variability of those elements in our galaxy's stars and planets.

> So if you had 100 billion tons of uranium you could jumpstart a magnetic field on Mars?
