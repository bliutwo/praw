> 44 otherwise healthy volunteers for three weeks with no control group.  Interesting, but probably needs validation with a larger population.

## People who experienced neglect in childhood are more likely to struggle to maintain a stable and coherent sense of self, which in turn is associated with dysfunctional sexual behaviors, according to new research published in the International Journal of Sexual Health.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/06/identity-difficulties-might-act-as-a-psychological-mechanism-linking-neglect-in-childhood-to-sexual-disturbances-in-adulthood-61217):

> People who experienced neglect in childhood are more likely to struggle to maintain a stable and coherent sense of self, which in turn is associated with dysfunctional sexual behaviors, according to new research published in the International Journal of Sexual Health. The researchers recruited 374 adults from Canada and Europe, and had them complete an anonymous online survey that assessed childhood neglect, childhood sexual abuse, identity impairment, and sexual disturbances. "This study was only assessing two indicators of sexual difficulties, sexual concerns and dysfunctional sexual behaviors. I think further research should explore broader aspects of sexual well-being in association with childhood neglect such as sexual satisfaction, distress, function and even sexual communication," Bigras explained.

## Slamming political rivals may be the most effective way to go viral – revealing social media’s ‘perverse incentives’. This is according to a study led by University of Cambridge psychologists, who analysed over 2.7 million Tweets and Facebook posts

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/viralpolitics):

> Use of terms for the political ingroup had no significant effect on the chances of shares. Negative language increased shares by up to 45% per word, while each positive word decreased sharing by 2-5%. Ingroup terms did little to sharing chances. Rathje, Van Bavel, and van der Linden have also recently launched a research project allowing people to gauge the political slant of news shared by Twitter accounts - whether their own or other public feeds - as well as how reliable it is.

## Analysis finds no real-world link among COVID-19 vaccines and brain blood clots

Summary of [original article](https://www.strokejournal.org/article/S1052-3057(21)00326-8/fulltext):

> To assess the association of COVID-19 vaccines and non-COVID-19 vaccines with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. In light of this, it is critical to better understand how COVID-19 vaccines affect the risk of developing CVST, and specifically whether any FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines demonstrably increases the risk of developing CVST and/or VITT. This study investigates these questions by leveraging a large multi-state EHR system to analyze individuals who have received over 130,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and over 771,000 doses of non-COVID-19 vaccines. We searched for records of any vaccine that had any of the following adverse events: Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial Venous Sinus Thrombosis, Superior Sagittal Sinus Thrombosis, Cerebral Venous Thrombosis, Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis, Transverse Sinus Thrombosis within 30 days.

> I was excited by your headline but disappointed that the study doesn’t appear to have included the Astra-Zeneca (Oxford) vaccine which is the one most under the spotlight for potential links with blood clots.

## People who support a ban on pornography tend to hold more sexist views about women. Generally, consuming pornography or supporting legal pornography was either non-predictive of sexism, or predicted lower sexism

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/06/people-who-support-a-ban-on-pornography-tend-to-hold-more-sexist-views-about-women-study-finds-61202):

> The study, published in The Journal of Sex Research, also indicates that people who believe pornography should be legal tend to hold more egalitarian gender attitudes compared to those think pornography should be banned. "On one side of this debate, those opposed to pornography suggest that it is, by nature, sexist because it objectifies women; on the other side of the debate, those who support pornography make the argument that those involved in the creation, production, and consumption of pornography should be free to do so and that preventing them from this solely because they are women would itself be sexist," added co-author David Speed, an assistant professor. "We used General Social Survey data, which gathers information from across the United States about many different topics, including questions about pornography legality, consumption and gender equality. We found that people who support pornography being legal and regulated reported less sexist attitudes than those who believed pornography should be outright illegal," MacDonald told PsyPost.

> Consuming pornography, or being willing to admit consuming pornography? Because lots of anti-women places show up with the kinkiest popular pornhub searches.

## An Australian-based team researching dementia has discovered that low-intensity ultrasound can restore cognition affected by ageing.

Summary of [original article](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/article/2021/06/non-invasive-potential-treatment-alzheimers-disease):

> Dr Daniel Blackmore, senior postdoctoral researcher on the team, said the new research aimed to use ultrasound to restore LTP and improved spatial learning in aged mice. Previous research has shown the long-term safety of ultrasound technology and that pathological changes and cognitive deficits could be improved by using ultrasound to treat Alzheimer's disease. "''We believe there may be some overlap between physiological and pathological ageing in the brain and the potential for this to be corrected with ultrasound is meaningful for those living with Alzheimer's disease," he said.
