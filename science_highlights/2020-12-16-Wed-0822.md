## German scientists say the prices we pay for meat and dairy products are too low as they fail to account for costs to society and the climate in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The biggest polluter is conventionally-produced meat, they say, which should be nearly 2.5 times its current price.

> The issue is if you start taxing food to inflate prices, those taxes won't be used to compensate for the damage they do. See taxes on gasoline in europe, the state sees it as income not as money that should be used to counterbalance the damage it does to our environment.

## Reading fiction like The Hunger Games may reduce prejudice and promote collective action on behalf of disadvantaged groups. A similar association has been found previously with Harry Potter books. Books can help people “reflect on what is around them”.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/reading-the-hunger-games-can-reduce-prejudice-and-promote-collective-action-study-finds-58806):

> New research provides evidence that reading "The Hunger Games" books can promote collective action on behalf of disadvantaged groups. After controlling for the number of "The Hunger Games" movies watch, Vezzali and his colleagues found that reading more "The Hunger Games" books was associated with higher levels of anger against social inequalities, which in turn was positively associated with collective action. Why were the results found among those with a low social dominance orientation in the first study and a high social dominance orientation in the second? The researchers believe the nature of the intervention in the second study - and the fact that adolescents were examined rather than adults - could explain the divergent results.

## Learning to program a computer is similar to learning a new language. However, MIT neuroscientists found that reading computer code does not activate language processing brain regions. Instead, it activates a network for complex cognitive tasks such as solving math problems or crossword puzzles.

## A manly beard may help drive sales by increasing perceptions of expertise and trust. Beards from an evolutionary perspective serve as a cue to others about masculinity, maturity, competence, leadership and status. The ability to grow a healthy beard may signal ‘immuno-competence.’

Summary of [original article](https://www.stedwards.edu/post/news-releases/st-edwards-university-study-finds-manly-beard-may-help-drive-sales):

> If you work in a sales or service role, you might consider the power of donning a beard before no-shave November rolls around. Sarah Mittal, assistant professor of Marketing at St. Edward's University and the paper's lead researcher, and David H. Silvera, associate professor of Business at University of Texas at San Antonio, conducted five studies to test the "Power of the beard," predicting that the beard would be an advantage in sales and service roles. "The beard truly seems to send a consistent message about expertise in one's field - a key driver in sales success. These effects also hold in a service context, where bearded individuals receive higher service satisfaction ratings," Silvera said.

## Avocado Consumption Alters Gastrointestinal Bacteria Abundance and Microbial Metabolite Concentrations among Adults with Overweight or Obesity. People who ate avocado every day had a greater abundance of gut microbes that break down fiber and produce metabolites that support gut health.

## After decades of exploration in nature’s smallest domains, physicists have finally found evidence that anyons exist. First predicted by theorists in the early 1980s, these particle-like objects only arise in realms confined to two dimensions

## Lonely people have a unique brain signature, perhaps due to so much imagined social contact

`/u/fotogneric` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kdldcm/lonely_people_have_a_unique_brain_signature/):

> “In the absence of desired social experiences,” the authors write, “lonely individuals may be biased towards internally directed cognitions,” as if “to fill the social void.”
> 
> In that sense, then, the physical effects of loneliness on the brain are not surprising. Paying “greater attention to one’s inner milieu, and a heightened focus on the self and self-reflective thoughts,” the authors write, “would naturally engage memory-based functions of the default network.”
> 
> Indeed, past research has found that lonely people are more likely to engage in imaginary social interactions, nostalgic reminiscences, and hypothetical conversations, and are also more likely to treat pets like people.

## Better prisons reduce recidivism. Prisoners that were randomly assigned to newer, less crowded, and higher service prisons had a 36% lower probability of returning to prison within one year.

> I keep seeing the argument that better job training and services to prisoners is wrong unless all citizens can get that for free.
> 
> However, if we are going to spend "X" dollars on convicts, the way to dramatically reduce crime is to provide halfway houses and jobs training.
> 
> I also believe that all citizens should have access to affordable jobs training, but that's a separate issue.
