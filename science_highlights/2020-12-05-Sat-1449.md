## Biological diversity evokes happiness in people - More bird species in the vicinity increase life satisfaction of Europeans as much as higher income. 14 additional bird species raise the level of life satisfaction at least as much as an extra 124 Euros per month. (n=26,000)

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/gcfi-bde120420.php):

> Species diversity was measured based on the diversity of avian species, as documented in the European breeding bird atlas. Birds are well-suited as indicators of biological diversity, since they are among the most visible elements of the animate nature - particularly in urban areas. "The Global Assessment 2019 by the World Biodiversity Council IPBES and studies of avian species in agricultural landscapes in Europe clearly show that the biological diversity is currently undergoing a dramatic decline. This poses the risk that human well-being will also suffer from an impoverished nature. Nature conservation therefore not only ensures our material basis of life, but it also constitutes an investment in the well-being of us all," adds Methorst in conclusion.

## Voyager Probes Spot Previously Unknown Phenomenon in Deep Space. “Foreshocks” of accelerated electrons up to 30 days before a solar flare shockwave makes it to the probes, which now cruise the interstellar medium.

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/voyager-probes-spot-previously-unknown-phenomenon-in-de-1845793983):

> As the new paper describes, these shock waves are facilitating a previously unseen behavior in the interstellar medium, namely bursts of electrons appearing far ahead of the advancing shock waves. "We detected the electron bursts when the shock waves first touched the magnetic field lines running through the Voyager spacecraft-and that's the mechanism. The shock wave just touches the magnetic field line, and there's a jump at the shock, which reflects and energizes a few of the cosmic ray electrons." "More data will be needed to better understand these results," he said, including more data from Voyager 2, "Which hasn't been in the interstellar medium for long," as well as NASA's upcoming IMAP mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2024.The new paper could improve our understanding of the complex interactions between shock waves and cosmic radiation, not just in the outskirts of our neighborhood but around other stars as well, including exploding stars.

## Employees who take charge relatively more in their teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders. However, such employees are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

## A smile, which brings up the corners of the mouth and creates crow's feet around the eyes, can reduce the pain of a needle injection by up to 40%, and also blunt a stressful needle-related physiological response by lowering the heart rate

> A grimace had the same effect as a "genuine smile".  But a non-genuine smile did not.
> 
> The grimace may be more useful.  Getting patients to give a "genuine" rather than fake smile may be difficult when they're facing a needle ("No! I need your smile to have crow's feet!  Do you want this shot or not?!")  Getting them to grimace might be easier.
> 
> Of course that's not as feel-good as "smiles kill pain!"  But that's OK with me.  *Grimace*.

## To decarbonize economy, researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "electrify" economic sectors with wind & solar energy. In some years, we will have to install more than a 100 GW of solar PV and wind power, and to achieve full decarbonization, CO2 prices will have to be a lot higher than today.

## CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing successful for a patient with Sickle Cell Disease and another patient with transfusion dependent β-Thalassemia - More than a year later, both patients had clinically improved and no longer needed blood transfusions. (NEJM, 5 Dec 2020)

> Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses γ-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer. Approximately 80% of the alleles at this locus were modified, with no evidence of off-target editing. After undergoing myeloablation, two patients — one with TDT and the other with SCD — received autologous CD34+ cells edited with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the same BCL11A enhancer. More than a year later, both patients had high levels of allelic editing in bone marrow and blood, increases in fetal hemoglobin that were distributed pancellularly, transfusion independence, and (in the patient with SCD) elimination of vaso-occlusive episodes.

## blood type may play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Study finds slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types & the risk of death was increased for type AB & decreased for types A & B. Rh-negative blood type have a protective effect for infection, intubation & death outcomes.

## Depressive symptoms induced by insurmountable job stress and sick leave for mental health reasons have become a focal concern. Researchers have now come up with the Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI), a measure designed to quantify the severity of work-attributed depressive symptoms.

> The department I worked in at my former employer is going to 9 day weeks with just a 40¢/hr increase on weekends, that’s in addition to increasing the workload of their current workforce by arguably more than 2X while tying their evaluations (and therefor pay) to impossible metrics. I put on about 100lbs working there and didn’t start to lose it until I emotionally divorced myself from the position and devised an exit strategy. I’m currently unemployed and burning through my savings and I still feel less stress on a daily basis now that I’m gone even though my future has never been less certain in nearly 40 years. If the amount of damage to people that the working environment I came from can be objectively measured and companies be penalized for fostering those kinds of environments, this would be excellent news indeed. Even if such an index could be published as a warning to potential employees we’d be doing something.

> EDIT man does this amount of attention make me nervous. a few things; not naming the company because I still have friends and family there. I’ll just say that if a place has upwards of 500 locations there’s a serious chance they’re doing *some*thing heinous enough to make you queasy if you heard about it. Plus if you’re not in the Mid-Atlantic there’s a really good chance you don’t have to worry about this one anyway. And maybe stick to Mom and Pops for your gas and grocery just to be safe. Also thanks for the general support.
