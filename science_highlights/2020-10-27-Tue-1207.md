## New research shows that when vampire bats feel sick, they socially distance themselves from groupmates in their roost – no public health guidance required. Study was conducted in the wild, tracking bats' social encounters with "backpack" computers containing proximity sensors.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/for-vampire-bats-social-distancing-while-sick-comes-naturally/):

> "That's the same thing we were observing in this study: In the wild, vampire bats - which are highly social animals - keep their distance when they're sick or living with sick groupmates. And it can be expected that they reduce the spread of disease as a result." Among their previous findings: Vampire bats make friends through a gradual buildup of trust, and vampire bat moms maintained social connections to their offspring even when both felt sick. On average, compared to control bats, the sick bats associated with four fewer groupmates over the six-hour treatment period and spent 25 fewer minutes interacting per partner, and the time any two bats spent near each other was shortest if the encounter involved at least one sick bat.

## 'Fireball' that fell to Earth is full of pristine extraterrestrial organic compounds, scientists say

> Note: ‘organic compounds’ doesn’t mean that they’re alive or anything: it just means the compounds in question are primarily carbon, hydrogen or oxygen. At least if I remember my organic chemistry from a couple years ago correctly.

## 6% of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US were healthcare workers. Among them, 36% were in nursing-related occupations. Approximately 28% of these patients were admitted to an ICU, 16% required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4% died.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943e3.htm?s_cid=mm6943e3_w):

> HCP were defined as persons working in health care settings, home health care services, or health care occupations within other settings who have potential for exposure to patients or infectious materials. To decrease the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care facilities, CDC recommends that HCP use face masks at all times while they are in health care facilities, including patient-care areas, staff member rooms, and areas where other HCP might be present. Findings from this analysis of data from a multisite surveillance network highlight the prevalence of severe COVID-19-associated illness among HCP and potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among HCP, which could decrease the workforce capacity of the health care system.

> As a nurse, this is a good reason why I go the extra step to keep my distance and always wear a mask.

## A new study from the University of Copenhagen shows that people doing hard physical work have a 55-per cent higher risk of developing dementia than those doing sedentary work. The figures have been adjusted for lifestyle factors and lifetime, among other things.

Summary of [original article](https://healthsciences.ku.dk/newsfaculty-news/2020/10/hard-physical-work-significantly-increases-the-risk-of-dementia/):

> Men in jobs with hard physical work have a higher risk of developing dementia compared to men doing sedentary work, new research from the University of Copenhagen reveals. A new study from the University of Copenhagen shows that people doing hard physical work have a 55-per cent higher risk of developing dementia than those doing sedentary work. The WHO guide to preventing dementia and disease on the whole mentions physical activity as an important factor. But our study suggests that it must be a 'good' form of physical activity, which hard physical work is not. Guides from the health authorities should therefore differentiate between physical activity in your spare time and physical activity at work, as there is reason to believe that the two forms of physical activity have opposite effects," Kirsten Nabe-Nielsen says and explains that even when you take smoking, blood pressure, overweight, alcohol intake and physical activity in one's spare time into account, hard physical work is associated with an increased occurrence of dementia.

`/u/ToxDocUSA` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jize9b/a_new_study_from_the_university_of_copenhagen/):

> Leaves a lot of questions.  Is it something about doing the physical activity for work that makes it worse, or is it doing physical activity constantly throughout the day rather than in brief/intermittent bursts?  For example, being a military physician, my actual job is relatively sedentary, but I do an hourish of intense exercise every morning "for work" / not in my free time.  Does that raise my risk?
> 
> Also, did they control for head injuries?  There's a reason manual laborers are often in helmets, could this increased dementia just be a result of serial mTBI?  Or, is the dementia we see in some retired pro athletes more associated with their physical exertion than their injuries?

## Talking to people at gun shows about suicide prevention and the risks of unsecured firearms can lead to safe weapons storage, according to a new study.

> Or we could just provide an economy that makes people not want to off themselves. 
> 
> Or make it easy enough to get quality help that a person chooses that over suicide. 
> 
> Relating firearm storage to suicide is like relating building height to suicide. Suicide nets aren't a solution to suicide just like not having access to guns isn't a solution to suicide.

## In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries (n = 200 countries).

`/u/wwarnout` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jizwg2/in_countries_with_cultural_norms_or_government/):

> The US government has demonstrated the exact opposite of "government policies supporting public mask-wearing".
> 
> A further study involving state governments' policies would be interesting.  The study would suggest that the per-capita mortality would be lower in those states that supported mask-wearing.

## A study by the Imperial College of London of more than 350,000 people shows that antibodies fade within few months, dealing a blow to the herd immunity theory

Summary of [original article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/207333/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence-falling-england-react/):

> The REACT study is using finger-prick testing to detect coronavirus antibodies in the blood. After accounting for the accuracy of the test, confirmed by laboratory evaluation, and the country's population characteristics, the study found that antibody prevalence declined from 6.0% to 4.8% and then 4.4% over the three months. REACT has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and is being carried out in partnership with Imperial College London, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Ipsos MORI. Kelly Beaver, Managing Director of Public Affairs at Ipsos MORI said: "Over 365,000 members of the public have volunteered to take part in this at home antibody study which involves a small fingerprick test. I'd like to thank all of those that took the time to participate in the study which provides another piece of information to help the Government manage the pandemic for us all."

> really bad title, not even representative of the content of the article. this isn't a blow to herd immunity, your body doesn't keep antibodies around forever, it remembers how to create antigen-specific antibodies in memory t cells.
