## Conservatives are more likely to express concern about climate change when framed as a national security concern and communicated by members of the armed services.

Summary of [original article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524032.2020.1799836):

> We devised an environmental communication strategy that attributes pro-climate messages to military service members, aimed at convincing conservative climate skeptics to express elevated concern. In a large survey experiment, we show that conservatives are more likely to express concern about climate change when framed as a national security concern and communicated by members of the armed services. Supplementary analyses of an original military service member survey suggest that this approach is externally valid, as many past and current armed forces express concern about the effects of climate change.

> That's..... Extremely specific to research

## President Trump’s use of Twitter diverts crucial media from topics that are potentially harmful to him or that he considers threatening. The pattern is absent in placebo analyses involving other topics that do not present a political risk to the president.

> It's been blatantly obvious for years that he loves to make a loud noise, either on Twitter or by actually doing something in the real world, to distract from bad things coming out about him.

## Sleep loss hijacks brain’s activity during learning. Getting only half a night’s sleep, as many medical workers and military personnel often do, hijacks the brain’s ability to unlearn fear-related memories. It might put people at greater risk of conditions such as anxiety and PTSD

Summary of [original article](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/sleep-loss-hijacks-brains-activity-during-learning):

> One third of subjects got normal sleep, one third were sleep restricted, so they slept only the first half the night, and one third were sleep deprived, so they got no sleep at all. Brain imaging recorded during the tasks showed activation in brain areas associated with emotional regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex, in people who got normal sleep. During the extinction recall 12 hours later, their brain activity looked more similar to those with normal sleep, suggesting that a limited night of sleep may be worse than none at all.

> So, this means missing sleep after a highly stressful/embarrasing/or trauma filled day could lead to those memories failing to suppress and leading to anxiety and/or ptsd?

## A small minority of “superspreader” points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants and religious establishments account for a large majority of COVID-19 infections and restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2923-3?T=AU):

> The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models which capture the effects of changes in mobility on virus spread1. The Supplementary Methods section describes our comparison of SafeGraph mobility data to Google mobility data, where we find high correlation; sensitivity analyses of the model and tests of model identifiability, a detailed description of how we estimated dynamic mobility networks from raw SafeGraph data using iterative proportional fitting. The Supplementary Discussion section covers further discussion of the racial and socioeconomic disparities predicted by our model; limitations of the model and mobility dataset.

> People. Need. To. Read. This.

> This is so common in complex systems where you see a few key factors dominating the outcome (kind of similar to Pareto distributions). Target your efforts there and the results are much more noticeable. Pandemic response has so far been focused on widespread linear-style adjustments whereas a key influencer approach with some kind of power law assumptions would be preferable (in my opinion).

## Physicists have re-created a nuclear reaction that happened between two and three minutes after the Big Bang. Their measurement nails down the most uncertain factor in a sequence of steps known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis that forged the universe’s first atomic nuclei.

Summary of [original article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-pin-down-nuclear-reaction-from-moments-after-the-big-bang-20201111/):

> The precise amount of deuterium that remains reveals key details about those first minutes, including the density of protons and neutrons and how quickly they became separated by cosmic expansion. Adding to the difficulty, cosmic rays that constantly rain down on Earth's surface can mimic the signal produced by deuterium reactions. A longstanding "Fly in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis ointment," according to Fields, is that the matter density calculated from deuterium and the cosmic microwave background predicts that there should be three times more lithium in the universe than we actually observe.

> Ok, can someone eli5 how the hell people come to the conclusion that "x happened y amount of seconds/minutes/hours after the big bang?" Like, with an uncountable amount of matter and energy in the universe, how are we so confident that this happened in this *incredibly* specific timeframe nearly 14 billion years ago?

## 68% of the tested mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts had evidence of COVID-19 infection, with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/09/science.abe5901):

> Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. The sequences generated from mink farms and from mink farm employees were compared with the national database consisting of around 1,775 WGS. To discriminate between community acquired infections and mink farm related SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to determine the potential risk for people living close to mink farms, WGS was also performed on 34 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, sampled from 04-03-2020 until 29-04-2020, from individuals who live in the same four-digit postal code area as the first four mink farms. These local sequences, sampled in a proxy of around 19 km2, reflected the general diversity of SARS-CoV-2 seen in the Netherlands and were not related to the clusters of mink sequences found on the mink farms, thereby indicating no spill-over to people living in close proximity to mink farms had occurred and that the sequences from SARS-CoV-2 infected animals and farm workers clustered by farm.

> One of the main reasons this is a huge deal, is that jumping species to species makes mutations much more likely.
> 
> It's possible that once we get a workable vaccine we just see 'mink Covid' or some other new type that spread to another species and then back to humans.  The existing vaccine might work still, it might not.
> 
> But if it can easy jump species then even a worldwide vaccine wont eliminate it.  Because we'd have to not just give it to every person; we'd have to give it to every **mammal**.
> 
> Rats, bats, and raccoons arent exactly the easiest populations to vaccinate...
