## Sleep deprivation impairs the suppression of unwanted thoughts and memories which enter conscious awareness when individuals confront reminders. Sleep-deprived people experienced significantly more intrusions and unsuccessful suppressions of unwanted thoughts.

## High achievement cultures may kill students' interest in math—specially for girls. Girls were significantly less interested in math in countries like Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden and New Zealand. But, surprisingly, the roles were reversed in countries like Oman, Malaysia, Palestine and Kazakhstan.

Summary of [original article](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2020/11/25/psychology-gender-differences-boys-girls-mathematics-schoolwork-performance-interest/):

> A new study in Frontiers in Psychology suggests that high national math achievement combined with societal pressures may contribute to how well girls and boys like math. "It seems that cultures that promote high achievement in math may also tend to kill many pupils' interest in math schoolwork and I found that this negative effect of high-achievement culture was stronger among girls than among boys!". "By highlighting how girls' interest in schoolwork is especially sensitive to high-achievement culture, perhaps my work can make researchers and policy-makers recognize and address this challenge: How can schools promote high achievement in mathematics without killing pupils' interest in their schoolwork?" says Eriksson.

> In the UK, there's a culture of "ugh maths is hard, I can't do it, I hate it" particularly in older generations, which must have an influence on newer generations. Is this a thing in other countries?

## Children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers — and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson. Retribution is a driving force in young children’s moral judgement.

Summary of [original article](https://news.yale.edu/2020/11/23/children-more-willing-punish-if-wrongdoer-taught-lesson):

> Many children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers - and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson, a new Yale study published Nov. 23 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour shows. The children first had to decide whether to punish the art destroyer by taking away their iPad. However, if the children decided to punish the transgressor, they would have to make a personal sacrifice - their own iPad would be locked away. Children in the second group, who knew that the wrongdoer would be told why he or she was being disciplined, were 24% more likely to punish than the first group.

`/u/tocktober` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k2bfrt/children_are_willing_to_make_personal_sacrifices/):

> I'd be interested to know more about the kids in their sample. one author says "Children are less exposed to social ideas about how to behave in certain ways" and it seems like the underlying assumption there is "because they have less exposure to ideas, their natural impulses will be more exposed" but that honestly seems like a HUGE assumption to make. it says the kids were between the ages of 4-7, which covers a huge range of developmental milestones. And even the youngest still has 4 years of being punished or disciplined by their own parents at the very least. What if they're not exhibiting natural inclinations as much as they are reflecting what they've observed and learned?

## Self-continuity forms the very basis of identity. Every time you use the word 'I', you're referring to a thread that stitches a series of experiences into a tapestry of a lifetime, representing a relationship between the self of your youth with one yet to emerge.

## Most people in the US did not have antibody evidence of previous COVID-19 infection, finds a new study of all 50 states. Fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, reinforcing the need for continued measures, including face masks and social distancing, to limit the spread.

## The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team at National Museums NI.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/science/ireland-first-only-dinosaur-find-confirmed/?utm_source=DamnInteresting):

> The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team led by Dr. Mike Simms, a curator and paleontologist at National Museums NI. Drawing on the expertise of scientists from the University of Portsmouth and Queen's University Belfast, the two bone fragments were found to belong to two different individuals. If you're into dinosaur hunting, Ireland is one of the most frustrating places to ply your trade. "The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Ireland's rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores. The two dinosaur fossils that Roger Byrne found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilized."

> The museum curator wanted to keep them for his personal collection, but no he must practice restraint.

## As interactions increasingly take place online, people find information that confirms their existing beliefs, making them less willing to listen to alternatives. This exacerbates filter bubbles and explains why public debates become polarized as people become impervious to opposing arguments.

Summary of [original article](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/press-releases/beliefs-filter-bubbles):

> The results showed that whether participants integrated information from the social environment in their second estimate depended on whether and how strongly their peers' estimates deviated from each other and from their own estimate. Overall, three adjustment strategies were identified: sticking to one's original estimate, adopting the estimate of one of the three peers, or compromising between one's original estimate and the peer estimates. "Our experiment quantifies how people weigh their own prior beliefs and the beliefs of others. In our context, there is actually no reason to assume that one's own estimate is better than anyone else's. But what we see here is an effect known in psychology as 'egocentric discounting' - namely that people put more weight on their own beliefs than on those of others," explains co-author Alan Noveas Tump, postdoc at the Center for Adaptive Rationality of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.

`/u/CrucialLogic` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k20c2n/as_interactions_increasingly_take_place_online/):

> You have to wonder how much social media companies have a part in this. If they build algorithms to present information similar to what the user has been viewing in the past, surely that can be a large part of what drives such unbalanced viewing. Facebook, Reddit, Amazon and all sorts of companies try this with the aim of keeping their "customers" more engaged, which keeps them coming back to the site.
