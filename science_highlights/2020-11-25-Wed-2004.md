## People who are psychologically flexible have better romantic and family relationships. It is about being open to experiences, experiencing thoughts and feelings without obsessively clinging to them, and continuing to take steps toward a goal, even in the face of setbacks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/psychological-flexibility-romantic-familial-relationships-462812/):

> Analysis shows those who are psychologically flexible have better romantic and family relationships. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way," Leo Tolstoy wrote famously in 1878 in the opening lines of Anna Karenina. Seeing difficult thoughts and feelings as a personal reflection and feeling judged or shameful for having them.

> So how do you become more psychologically flexible then?

## Dogmatic people are characterised by a belief that their worldview reflects an absolute truth and are often resistant to change their mind, for example when it comes to partisan issues. They seek less information and make less accurate judgements as a result, even on simple matters.

## Adolescents with migraine who attend high schools that follow AAP recommendations for start times have lower headache frequency than those whose high schools start before 8:30 am. Shifting to a later high school start time may be an effective strategy for migraine prevention in adolescents.

## Pesticide deadly to bees now easily detected in honey - Researchers developed fully automated technique that extracts pyrethroids from honey. Pyrethroids contribute to colony collapse disorder in bees, a phenomenon where worker honeybees disappear.

## US pollution regulations meant to protect humans from dirty air are also saving birds. So concludes a new continent-wide study. Improved air quality under a federal program to reduce ozone pollution may have averted the loss of 1.5 billion birds during the past 40 years

Summary of [original article](https://mailchi.mp/cornell/release-clean-air-act-ozone-reductions-saved-at-least-15-million-birds-1319360?e=f0b505020c):

> Improved air quality, reduced ozone pollution may have averted bird deaths For Release: November 24, 2020.Ithaca, NY-U.S. pollution regulations meant to protect humans from dirty air are also saving birds. Ozone pollution directly harms birds by damaging their respiratory system, and indirectly affects birds by harming their food sources. "Not surprisingly, birds that cannot access high-quality habitat or food resources are less likely to survive or reproduce successfully. The good news here is that environmental policies intended to protect human health return important benefits for birds too." Last year, a separate study by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology showed that North American bird populations have declined by nearly 3 billion birds since 1970.

## Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center have developed what could be a promising therapeutic for COPD, with ramifications that go beyond just emphysema as lung regeneration has traditionally been elusive and will be a hot topic in the near future, for obvious reasons.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2882-8):

> Therapeutic inhibition of LTβR signalling in young and aged mice disrupted smoking-related inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, induced regeneration of lung tissue, and reverted airway fibrosis and systemic muscle wasting. 5 Inhibition of LTβR signalling strongly reduces non-canonical but not canonical NF-κB signalling in lung.

> I know this study was just in mice but its findings are really exciting- not only did they stop the degeneation of the lung’s epithelial cells but they kickstarted a full regeneration in the mice’s cells.
> 
> Outside of what this could mean for COPD this counter to lung fibrosis is vitally important for the comorbidities we will possibly be seeing due to COVID-19

## Plasma from people who recover from COVID-19 doesn't help new patients: No significant differences observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo. Publication in the New England Journal of Medicine

Summary of [original article](http://www.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2031304):

> An exploratory analysis in 4330 patients showed no significant difference in 7-day mortality between patients who received high-titer plasma and those who received low-titer plasma in the overall population, whereas 20% lower 7-day mortality was seen in the predefined subgroup of nonintubated patients who received higher-titer plasma than in those who received lower-titer plasma. 13 In an attempt to more clearly determine the effect of convalescent plasma in Covid-19, we planned and conducted the PlasmAr trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Effect of convalescent plasma therapy on time to clinical improvement in patients with severe and life-threatening COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial.

> Wasn't this report from a very small test group (<500) and the patients were all suffering from pneumonia.  I hope that my donations weren't in vain because the days following my visit to the Red Cross left me drained and fatigued.

> Being colorblind really frustrates me when I'm trying to get racism down.  So, Hispanic people are white, but Asian people aren't? How does that make sense?  Do people actually see the color yellow when they look at Asian skin? I don't see it; I don't get it.
