## Conservatives and liberals differ on COVID-19 because conservatives tend to attribute negative outcomes to purposeful actions by threats high in agency. If health officials talked about the virus as a palpable enemy that is seeking to attack humans, they may get greater buy-in from conservatives.

## A new study demonstrates positive effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion. Health insurance expansions increased early-stage cancer diagnoses, while rates of late-stage cancer decreased, highlighting the role of public health insurance in improving cancer outcomes.

> And universal health care would improve on that. Abolish for profit insurance companies, everyone gets coverage. The ACA is still only a bill to boost insurance companies, not to assure health care for all.

## Scientists have successfully used molecules to shut down the production of destructive proteins generated by the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, the researchers are working to aerosolize the RNA molecules so that they could be incorporated in an inhalable drug that would mitigate viral chaos.

> So they showed they can use RNAi to inhibit viral protein replication in a clinically irrelevant cell line. Cool. Something people have done for well over 25 years... and they say in the abstract the biggest flaw in using this therapeutically. Haven't dug into the paper deeply enough but from what I read so far this is typical media department hyped-up garbage.
