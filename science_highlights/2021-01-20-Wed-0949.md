Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l0mle7/best_of_rscience_2020_winners/):

> U/InvictusJoker for 'A new study makes it clear: after universal masking was implemented at Mass General Brigham, the rate of COVID-19 infection among health care workers dropped significantly. U/ Shibboleth 's many answers during his COVID-19 community discussions [Link 1] [Link 2] [Link 3]. u/aClimateScientist explains their own research studying the accuracy of climate modeling [Link]. In your experience, what is the best way to pivot from having a large body of evidence to formulating effective public policy? Especially in the city where I live and work, Chicago, health inequity is a pervasive social problem.

## In India, the rich cause seven times more emissions than the poor. The study presents the first nation-wide, region- and class-specific assessment of carbon footprint using the consumption data across 623 districts and 2,03,313 households.

## A national mask mandate in the US early in the COVID-19 pandemic could have led to as much as 47% less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates to up to 47,000 saved lives.

## A new study finds that, in the wake of a mass shooting, NRA employees, donors and volunteers had mixed emotions about the organization, reporting higher levels of positive and negative feelings, including fear, anger and disgust. The people most critical were those most closely affiliated with it.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/01/nra-stakeholders-conflicted/):

> A recent study finds that, in the wake of a mass shooting, National Rifle Association employees, donors and volunteers had extremely mixed emotions about the organization - reporting higher levels of both positive and negative feelings about the NRA, as compared to people with no NRA affiliation. The study also include 56 NRA employees, which made up 9% of the participants; 51 NRA members; three NRA donors; seven NRA volunteers; and 108 people who were not NRA members, but who supported the organization. People who said they support the NRA had more positive feelings about the NRA's actions than people who said they did not support the NRA. But there were some surprises.

## Kids who see their parents bicker during a separation or divorce are more likely to develop a fear of abandonment, new research warns. Children who reported higher fear of abandonment were more likely to report more mental health problems (bottled-up feelings of distress, anxiety or fear) later.

## Large-scale land acquisitions by foreign investors, intended to improve global food security, had little to no benefit, increasing crop production in some areas while simultaneously threatening local food security in others, according to researchers who studied their effects.

Summary of [original article](https://news.nd.edu/news/land-deals-meant-to-improve-food-security-may-have-hurt/):

> Large-scale land acquisitions by foreign investors, intended to improve global food security, had little to no benefit, increasing crop production in some areas while simultaneously threatening local food security in others, according to researchers who studied their effects. Following a global food crisis during the early 2000s, foreign investors purchased more than 220 million acres of land in middle-income and developing countries, according to the study's estimates, to increase crop production and contribute to the global food supply. "In many countries throughout the world land is being commodified, so it is becoming easier to buy and sell land. Those, and rising food prices, were drivers for these companies," Muller said.

## Scientists develope polymer cathodes for ultrafast batteries. The new cathodes withstand up to 25,000 operating cycles and charge in a matter of seconds, thus outperforming lithium-ion batteries. The cathodes can also be used to produce less expensive potassium dual-ion batteries.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/sios-rcd011921.php):

> Russian researchers from Skoltech, D. Mendeleev University, and the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics of RAS have synthesized and tested new polymer-based cathode materials for lithium dual-ion batteries. "Our previous research addressed polymer cathodes for ultra-fast high-capacity batteries that can be charged and discharged in a few seconds, but we wanted more," says Filipp A. Obrezkov, a Skoltech Ph.D. student and the first author of the paper. Thus the Russian team demonstrated that polymer cathode materials could create efficient lithium and potassium dual-ion batteries.

> >PDPAPZ potassium half-cells exhibited a high energy density of 398  Wh/kg. For comparison, the value for common lithium cells is 200-250  Wh/kg, the anode and electrolyte weights included.
> 
> I think that part is rather important. I had expected the upgrade in charge cycles and speed to come at the cost of energy density, but that does not seem to be the case.

## Teachers are working harder than ever before and more than any other occupation, according to a study. Data reveals for the first time how drop in job quality goes beyond just pay and hours. Training, the influence teachers have over their tasks and work-related well-being have also declined.

> Yep. Elementary teacher here. It's different in every district, but in the ones I've taught in, we have no choice in what we teach. Many curriculums are literally scripts that we have to follow. We're forced to enforce rules that we may not believe in (I literally don't care if the kids wear hats but I've gotten until trouble for not making them take them off), and are judged by admins who haven't been in the classroom for years. We spend hours in useless meetings and trainings. Our list of tasks keep growing and our autonomy keeps shrinking.
