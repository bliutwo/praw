## Researchers discovered that the light-sensitive protein cryptochrome 4, found in birds' retinas, is sensitive to magnetic fields and could well be the long-sought magnetic sensor of the migratory birds.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03618-9):

> Millitesla magnetic field effects on the photocycle of an animal cryptochrome. Magnetic sensitivity mediated by the Arabidopsis blue-light receptor cryptochrome occurs during flavin reoxidation in the dark. Broadband cavity-enhanced detection of magnetic field effects in chemical models of a cryptochrome magnetoreceptor.

> Abstract: 
> 
> Night-migratory songbirds are remarkably proficient navigators. Flying alone and often over great distances, they use various directional cues including, crucially, a light-dependent magnetic compass. The mechanism of this compass has been suggested to rely on the quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the retinas of the birds. Here we show that the photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and pigeon (Columba livia). Site-specific mutations of ErCRY4 reveal the roles of four successive flavin–tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and in stabilizing potential signalling states in a way that could enable sensing and signalling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds.

## U.S. life expectancy decreased by 1.87 years between 2018 and 2020, a drop not seen since World War II, according to new research from Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Colorado Boulder and the Urban Institute.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/vcu-pdl062121.php):

> RICHMOND, Va., - U.S. life expectancy decreased by 1.87 years between 2018 and 2020, a drop not seen since World War II, according to new research from Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Colorado Boulder and the Urban Institute. Other countries also saw declines in life expectancy between 2018 and 2020, but the loss of life expectancy in the U.S. was 8.5 times that of the average for 16 peer countries. "To give some perspective, when the decline in life expectancy was happening a few years ago, it was a decrease of about 0.1 years each year that was making front-page news," said Woolf, VCU's C. Kenneth and Dianne Wright Distinguished Chair in Population Health and Health Equity.

## A group of experts reviewed thousands of “studies” on weight loss supplements and treatments and rated them for their quality and bias. They found 52 reliable studies, only 16 of which showed any significant weight loss effects - reinforcing how bad the science behind weight loss marketing really is

## COVID-19 antibodies appear to wane rapidly. Research has found all vaccinated individuals, whether previously infected or not, will likely require booster shots moving forward because antibodies created through both vaccines and natural infection wane at the same relatively rapid rate

## Brain Inflammation From COVID-19 Looks Eerily Similar to That From Alzheimer's

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-changes-from-covid-19-look-eerily-similar-to-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-disease):

> The signs are eerily similar to what we see in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and yet no matter how hard the authors looked, they couldn't find any trace of the actual virus in the brain tissue. The study compared the brain tissue of 8 people who had died from COVID-19 with the brain tissue of 14 people who had died from other causes, including influenza. T-cell infiltration in the brain was apparent in all but one COVID-19 patient, while those in the control group showed none of these immune cells in their brain tissue.

## 3,000-year-old shark attack victim found. It is the earliest direct evidence for a shark attack on a human and caused 790 deep, serrated injuries to the victim. He was missing a hand, a leg and an arm, he was buried after the attack in a nearby cemetery with his leg placed on top of the body.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uoo-3sa062321.php):

> Newspapers regularly carry stories of terrifying shark attacks, but in a paper published today, Oxford-led researchers reveal their discovery of a 3,000-year-old victim - attacked by a shark in the Seto Inland Sea of the Japanese archipelago. Since archaeological cases of shark reports are extremely rare, they turned to forensic shark attack cases for clues and worked with expert George Burgess, Director Emeritus of the Florida Program for Shark Research. According to the pair, 'Given the injuries, he was clearly the victim of a shark attack.

## People's odds of loneliness could fall by up to half if cities hit 30% green space targets

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/peoples-odds-of-loneliness-could-fall-by-up-to-half-if-cities-hit-30-green-space-targets-161989):

> For people living on their own, the associations were even greater - in areas with 30% or more green space the odds of becoming lonely halved. It is good news that our study also found the odds of becoming lonely went down 52% among adults living alone in areas with more than 30% green space compared with those in areas with less than 10%. In other words, meeting urban greening targets could be especially important for the large numbers of people who live alone. A surprising finding from our study was that more green space did not provide relief from loneliness among the 1,282 adults in our sample who were lonely in 2013.

## New research shows the the brains of people who died from Covid-19 look terrifyingly similar to the brains of people who died from neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/this-is-your-brain-on-covid19):

> The most comprehensive molecular study yet of the brains of people who died of Covid-19 has put forth a potential answer to a mystery: Why people with the disease so often develop neurological conditions? These markers were so profound, the study team reports they're akin to what you'd expect to see in the brains of people who died of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. In the brains of deceased Covid-19 patients, T-cells were much more abundant than they were in the control brains.
