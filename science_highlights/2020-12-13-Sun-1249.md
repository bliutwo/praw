## Young adults who increased social media use were more likely to develop depression. Those using more than 300 min/day were 2.8 times as likely to become depressed within 6 months. Initial social media use led to increased depression, but initial depression did not lead to change in social media use.

Summary of [original article](https://news.uark.edu/articles/55480/increased-social-media-use-linked-to-developing-depression-research-finds):

> FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. - Young adults who increased their use of social media were significantly more likely to develop depression within six months, according to a new national study authored by Dr. Brian Primack, dean of the College of Education and Health Professions and professor of public health at the University of Arkansas. The study, which will be published online Dec. 10 and is scheduled for the February 2021 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is the first large, national study to show a link between social media use and depression over time. "We know from other large studies that depression and social media use tend to go together, but it's been hard to figure out which came first. This new study sheds light on these questions, because high initial social media use led to increased rates of depression. However, initial depression did not lead to any change in social media use."

## People with beliefs in conspiracy theories have a cognitive bias known as the jumping to conclusion (JTC) bias, the tendency to perform hasty decisions based on little evidence, and a preference for an intuitive general thinking style, as opposed to analytical thinking.

Summary of [original article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.568942/full):

> Third, our aim was to further elucidate the interplay of the different thinking styles and CB. Most conspiracy theories are intuitively appealing and therefore individuals who exhibit a stronger preference for an intuitive thinking style could be more inclined to belief in said theories. As our study is to our knowledge the first to show an association between the preference for an intuitive thinking style and the JTC-bias, our findings should be regarded as preliminary and require careful pre-registered replication in different samples and with different measures of JTC.Furthermore, we set out to provide further evidence for the relevance and importance of a preference for a more intuitive thinking style regarding the formation of CB. In fact, results of the regression analysis indicate that a preference for intuitive thinking predicts the degree of CB, with a moderate effect size of R2 =.14. A preference for analytic thinking may not detract from or, in some cases, could actually benefit the maintenance of CB. Future studies could therefore scrutinize the role of possible moderators of the association of analytic thinking and CB.Another possible explanation concerns the measurement of both thinking styles: As the Rational Experiential Inventory and its German version used in the present study are both self-assessments, they could measure rather the self-perception of the participants than the actual thinking preferences the participants use more often in their daily life.

## In the US, admission into selective high schools is as difficult to achieve as admission into top universities. However, a new study found that elite schools don’t help students academically any more than their less prestigious ones, including students from more disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/affirmative-action-unintended-consequences-chicago?T=AU):

> Since we didn't find evidence that they're doing much better with students in terms of academic outcomes, you could think that we should be focused more on investing in climate at all high schools. Chicago Public Schools admitted students based on race from 1980 until 2009-when a United States federal court lifted a consent decree that ordered schools to desegregate. "Since we didn't find evidence that they're doing much better with students in terms of academic outcomes, you could think that we should be focused more on investing in climate at all high schools."

## Hard and fast emission cuts will slow warming sooner than expected. The risk of experiencing warming rates that are stronger than anything previously seen would be 13 times lower with rapid and deep emissions cuts, compared to an “average” future that continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Summary of [original article](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4734/hard_and_fast_emission_cuts_will_slow_warming_sooner_than_expected):

> The study, published in Nature Climate Change, used thousands of simulations from different climate models alongside multiple estimates of observed natural climate variability to investigate how various levels of emissions cuts could affect the speed of global warming over the next two decades. The findings show that reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, and in particular with its aim to pursue efforts to stabilise global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, has a substantial effect on warming rates over the next 20 years, even after natural variability is taken into account. Taking action now means we can prevent global warming from accelerating in the next few decades, as well as get closer to the goal of limiting warming in the longer term.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kcf1ez/hard_and_fast_emission_cuts_will_slow_warming/):

> Anew study shows that strong and rapid action to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will help to slow down the rate of global warming over the next 20 years.
> 
> This highlights that immediate action on climate change can bring benefits within current lifetimes, not just far into the future.
> 
> Scientists already agree that rapid and deep emissions reductions made now will limit the rise in global temperatures during the second half of the century.
> 
> However, pinpointing shorter-term benefits over the next few decades has been more challenging, particularly as natural cycles in global atmosphere and ocean systems can cause slow ups and downs in temperature that temporarily mask human influence on the climate.
> 
> But, by using a novel approach that combines large amounts of data from different sources, a new study from the University has untangled human-induced warming from natural variability on much shorter timescales than previously thought possible.

## Study: Copper isotopes can be used to detect the amyloid-beta protein deposits that form in the brains of people living with – or at risk of developing – Alzheimer’s. Having access to longer-lasting diagnostic agents would make the process of diagnosing Alzheimer’s more accessible to people.

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article. (ERROR: <class 'smmryapi.SmmryAPIException'>)

`/u/simpliflyed` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kc5yrr/study_copper_isotopes_can_be_used_to_detect_the/):

> This title is misleading (or confused) to the point of incorrect. 
> The article is about a PET scanning tracer being used to image Alzheimer’s. There is no affinity between the copper and the amyloid plaques being detected, there is a carrier molecule doing that job and this has been the case for tracers using fluorine for a number of years. The article mentions that the carrier molecule being used here is actually not yet successful enough to do its job. 
> The development being covered in the article is that a longer-lived (than fluorine) copper isotope has been successfully attached to the carrier molecule. An isotope with a longer half life enables transport of the tracer over longer distances than with existing tracers. 
> However as PET facilities currently only exist within transport range of an appropriate radiopharmacy, my thought would be that this could only enable future PET expansion rather than enable extra abilities in current practice. And that also requires them fine tuning the carrier molecule enough to be successful. 
> 
> In fairness to the poster, the article is also pretty vague and difficult to understand. This is my field of practice so I was able to read between the lines quite a bit to make it out.

## Experts study effects on families of parental job loss during pandemic. Findings demonstrate that parental job loss due to the pandemic can have negative consequences on young children, including increased risk for psychological and physical abuse at the hands of their parents.

Summary of [original article](https://www.utsa.edu/today/2020/12/story/covid-parental-job-loss-research.html):

> Monica Lawson, an assistant professor of psychology; Megan Piel, an assistant professor of social work; and Michaela Simon, psychology graduate student in the College for Health, Community and Policy, have published a research article on the effects of parental job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic and risk of psychological and physical abuse toward children. The study included parental job loss and whether cognitive reframing moderated associations between job loss and child maltreatment. Lawson explained, "We're just starting to understand the impact of the pandemic on family functioning and well-being. Understanding factors that contribute to child abuse during the pandemic is critical for identifying at-risk families and providing services to protect children. This is especially important within the unique context of the pandemic, when many children are at home and out of sight of mandated reporters."

> A team of UTSA researchers has discovered that economic implications because of COVID-19 can have a devastating ripple effect on children. Monica Lawson, an assistant professor of psychology; Megan Piel, an assistant professor of social work; and Michaela Simon, psychology graduate student in the College for Health, Community and Policy, have published a research article on the effects of parental job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic and risk of psychological and physical abuse toward children.
> 
> Using a community sample of 342 parents of 4-to-10-year-olds living in the United States, the researchers investigated factors associated with child maltreatment during the pandemic.
> 
> “We know that risk for child abuse increases during economic crises. We saw this during the Great Depression and the Great Recession, and our study expanded this research to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Lawson. “We found that job loss due to the pandemic was associated with abuse toward children. Our study is unique by showing that positive coping strategies, however, can mitigate the risk for physical abuse against children, even among families where a parent has lost their job.”
