## Study reveals crucial differences in the way Black and white officers in the Chicago Police Department respond to incidents on their beat. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians.

> I wonder if the civilians react differently to Black and Hispanic officers, or if they react the same and it's 100% on the officers?

## Archaeologists have managed to get near-perfect notes out of a musical instrument that's more than 17,000 years old. The artefact is the oldest known wind instrument of its type. To date, only bone flutes can claim a deeper heritage.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56017967):

> It's a conch shell that was found in a hunter-gatherer cave in southern France. The scientists have identified the deliberate modifications that would have enhanced the shell's ability to make sound. The researchers have produced a 3D printed replica of the shell so they can further explore the musical possibilities of the conch without the risk of damaging the original artefact.

## Pigs show potential for 'remarkable' level of behavioral, mental flexibility on tasks normally given to non-human primates to analyze intelligence - Researchers teach four animals how to play a rudimentary joystick-enabled video game that demonstrates conceptual understanding beyond simple chance.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/f-psp020321.php):

> Pigs will probably never be able to fly, but new research is revealing that some species within the genus Sus may possess a remarkable level of behavioral and mental flexibility. The study involved two Yorkshire pigs named Hamlet and Omelette, and two Panepinto micro pigs, Ebony and Ivory. The study ended before the researchers could investigate a more ambitious goal: whether such a computer interface using symbols could be employed to communicate with the pigs more directly, as has been done with non-human primates.

> “Prior to the experiment, the focal length of the pigs was determined by lens refraction conducted by an optometrist to find the best position for the computer monitor (see Michaels, 1975). All pigs were found to be far-sighted, with each subject determined to be between +1 and +2 diopters hyperopic. To accommodate their visual limitations, the computer monitor was positioned approximately 45 cm away from the subjects’ eyes when they were using the joystick.”

> I love the fact that they tested their vision first.

## Scientists report the first evidence that, not short-term stress, like a series of tough college exams, rather chronic, unpredictable stress like that which erupts in our personal and professional lives, induces changes in the function of AgRP neurons that may contribute to depression

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/mcog-tpo021021.php):

> A tiny population of neurons known to be important to appetite appear to also have a significant role in depression that results from unpredictable, chronic stress, scientists say. "We can remotely stimulate those neurons and reverse depression," Lu says, using a synthetic small molecule agonist that binds to an also manmade chemogenetic receptor in their target neurons - a common method for studying the relationship between behavior and particular neurons - delivered directly to those neurons via a viral vector. While it's unknown if some of the existing antidepressants happen to impact AgRP neurons, it's possible that new therapies designed to target the neurons could also produce weight gain because of the neurons' role in feeding behavior and metabolism, Lu notes.

## Research has found conspiracy theorists more often live in societies that have less successful democracies, which influences trust in others and in the authorities. Tend to have a little less education, and more often obtain their information from social media.

> The more your government lies to you and hides things from you (e.g. in less democratic societies) the more *reasonable* it is to second guess the official narrative. Conspiracy theories are in this sense the product of people *searching for truth* and arriving at (sometimes) wrong conclusions.
> 
> I am certain this applies not just to the government but now social media. Given the massive push for information control on social media platforms, this can only serve to exacerbate conspiracy theories, not stop them. These policies feed into the conspiracy narrative and give people *good reason* to believe things are being hidden from them and that people behind the scenes are trying to control the narrative and manipulate the thoughts of the public (because that is exactly what they are doing). It's irrelevant whether they are hiding the "right" things; besides the fact that it is impossible to reach consensus on what should be allowed (the conspiracy theorists will never agree with you, for a start) it is the presence of the policy itself that is direct evidence of conspiracy in the form of information control.

## Local, sustainable production of animal feed is becoming a reality. Researchers are cultivating purple bacteria on Trappist brewery wastewater for use as a protein source that makes shrimp grow faster. Microbial proteins can reduce our environmental impact and dependency on imported proteins

> This development is yet another way to use existing systems and reduce impact. I hope this gains traction and investment. 
> 
> Just please be wary of corn lobbyists. Animal feed (which usually includes corn) is a big business but nothing near the size and scope of power that corn holds in the US. One could almost compare it to solar going up against oil. Almost. 
> 
> Breweries partnering with such a business may be the answer. Sort of subtle slow growth of an industry that pushes out corn in small increments, until they are the major contributor to feeds.

## Handgun ownership, not shotgun ownership, is associated with greater odds of a person having died from self-inflicted gunshot wound rather than another suicide method. When multiple types of firearms are owned, an individual is likely to default to handguns due to logistical issues or ease of access

> That’s all suicide. Apparently fences on bridges reduce suicide rates city-wide because when people have a hard time committing, they back out and don’t. Same with hand guns, too much opportunity to make a rash decision.

## Trump health policies led to 461,000 avoidable deaths each year, according to an extremely comprehensive public health report published today by The Lancet.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/trump-health-policies-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths-each-year/):

> In a 49-page study, nearly three dozen experts assembled by The Lancet concluded that U.S. health policies under the Trump administration resulted in an avoidable 461,000 deaths per year - plus an unnecessary four in 10 COVID-19-related deaths - blaming decades of policy failures that were significantly enhanced by the 45th president. Nearly three dozen experts assembled by The Lancet concluded that U.S. health policies under the Trump administration resulted in an avoidable 461,000 deaths per year - plus an unnecessary four in 10 COVID-19-related deaths - blaming decades of policy failures that were significantly enhanced by the 45th president. The Lancet Commission on Public Policy and Health in the Trump Era has been compiling data for the report since 2017, the year Donald Trump took office, tracking policy outcomes as far back as the Reagan Era.
