## Higher inflammation, as measured by cytokine activity in blood, was related to worse attention control, but five weeks of meditation training improved attention control. The study suggests that the immune system influences cognitive processes.

> Pro-inflammatory cytokines are linked to depression, also. The studies into this are mounting up. It's not just meditation rewiring the grey matter of the brain, it also seems to impact the rest of the body (c-reactive proteins are produced by the liver.) 
> 
> I started an undergraduate biology course when I had uncontrolled rheumatoid arthritis, with very high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the difference in my cognitive power was shocking. Being in chronic pain with fatigue was obviously a factor, but I maintained that there was more to it than that, as if the RA was eroding my brain. I am glad this is being studied.

## Drinking alcohol blocks the release of norepinephrine, a chemical that promotes attention, when we want to focus on something, in the brain. This may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

## A new way to turn natural gas into a non-explosive solid means that it can be easily stored and safely transported. It usually takes millions of years for these gas hydrates to form in nature, but now the same process can be effected within 15 minutes

## Elevated stress hormones could reawaken dormant cancer cells

Summary of [original article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/02/elevated-stress-hormone-levels-could-reawaken-dormant-cancer-cells-study-finds/):

> In a new study published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine, one group of researchers describes how a cascade of events set off by high levels of a stress hormone could cause dormant tumor cells to reawaken to once again cause cancer. In some cancer models, scientists found that an elevated level of norepinephrine led to the activation of cells known as neutrophils, which help shield tumor cells from the body's immune system. Activating neutrophils in turn led to these cells releasing a special type of lipid - which then awakened sleeping cancer cells.

## How a police contact by middle school leads to different outcomes for Black, white youth. Black youth are more likely than white youth to be treated as “usual suspects” after a first encounter with police, leading to subsequent arrests over time.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k80pn1/how_a_police_contact_by_middle_school_leads_to/):

> For Black youth, an encounter with police by eighth grade predicts they will be arrested by young adulthood – but the same is not true for white youth, a new University of Washington study finds.
> 
> Black young adults are 11 times more likely to be arrested by age 20 if they had an initial encounter with law enforcement in their early teens than Black youth who don’t have that first contact.
> 
> In contrast, white young adults with early police contact are not significantly more likely to be arrested later, compared with white peers without that history.
> 
> The study’s authors found that Black youth are more likely than white youth to be treated as “usual suspects” after a first encounter with police, leading to subsequent arrests over time. Even as white young adults report engaging in significantly more illegal behavior, Black young adults face more criminal penalties, the study finds.
> 
> Researchers also said it’s not just the number of stops, but what transpires during a police stop that sets the tone for future interactions with police.
> 
> “What we know about police contacts and youth generally is that Black youth are more likely to be stopped by police to begin with, and are more likely to have a negative experience when that happens,” said first author Annie McGlynn-Wright, a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University who led the study while pursuing her doctorate at the UW. “What we haven’t known previously is the long-term effects of police contacts in terms of criminal justice outcomes.”

## CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing successful for a patient with Sickle Cell Disease and another patient with transfusion dependent β-Thalassemia - More than a year later, both patients had clinically improved and no longer needed blood transfusions. (NEJM, 5 Dec 2020)

Summary of [original article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031054):

> Summary Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses γ-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer.

> These single gene defect diseases are going to be the first to be eradicated, but in the future more complicated genetic diseases will be treated too. It's an exciting time to be alive.

## Promising material can store solar energy. Researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.

Summary of [original article](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/study-shows-promising-material-can-store-solar-energy-for-months-or-years):

> With further development, these kinds of materials could offer exciting potential as a way of capturing solar energy during the summer months, and storing it for use in winter - where less solar energy is available. Further tests showed the material was able to store the energy for at least four months. Although the results were promising for this material's ability to store energy for long periods of time, its energy density was modest.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k7pcpe/promising_material_can_store_solar_energy/):

> As we move away from fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy to tackle climate change, the need for new ways to capture and store energy becomes increasingly important.
> 
> Lancaster University researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.
> 
> With further development, these kinds of materials could offer exciting potential as a way of capturing solar energy during the summer months, and storing it for use in winter – where less solar energy is available.
> 
> This would prove invaluable for applications such as heating systems in off-grid systems or remote locations, or as an environmentally-friendly supplement to conventional heating in houses and offices. It could potentially also be produced as a thin coating and applied to the surface of buildings, or used on the windscreens of cars where the stored heat could be used to de-ice the glass in freezing winter mornings.
> 
> The material is based on a type of ‘metal-organic framework’ (MOF). These consist of a network of metal ions linked by carbon-based molecules to form 3-D structures. A key property of MOFs is that they are porous, meaning that they can form composite materials by hosting other small molecules within their structures.
> 
> The Lancaster research team set out to discover if a MOF composite, previously prepared by a separate research team at Kyoto University in Japan and known as ‘DMOF1’, can be used to store energy – something not previously researched.
