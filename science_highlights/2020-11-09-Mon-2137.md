## Study: Hydroxychloroquine no better than placebo for hospitalized COVID-19 patients

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/11/09/Study-Hydroxychloroquine-no-better-than-placebo-for-COVID-19-patients/7711604934110/):

> Nov. 9 - COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed no signs of significant improvement in "Clinical status" compared with those given a placebo, a study published Monday by JAMA found. "The results show that hydroxychloroquine did not help patients recover from COVID-19," study co-author Dr. Wesley H. Self told UPI. "In the study, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and those treated with a placebo had nearly identical outcomes, [so] I do not foresee any role for hydroxychloroquine in acutely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19," said Self, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "Our results, especially when combined from other studies conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, are good evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not provide benefit for patients hospitalized with COVID-19," Self said.

Derek Lowe has good summaries of both on his *Science: In The Pipeline* blog: [The RECOVERY Trial Reports on Hydroxychloroquine](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/05/the-recovery-trial-reports-on-hydroxychloroquine), [The SOLIDARITY Data](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/10/16/the-solidarity-data). A combination of the two trials with 27 smaller randomized trials found no benefit from the drug (RR=1.10, 0.99-1.22). Due to the lack of efficacy and potential risk, both RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY have discontinued the hydroxychloroquine arms of their trials.

## When politicians have hiring discretion, public sector jobs often go to the least capable but most politically connected applicants. Patronage hires led to significant turnover in local bureaucracies after elections, which in turn likely disrupted the provision of public goods like education.

## Suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of Reddit posts during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on posts from 826,961 unique users. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and PTSD became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster.

> Public commentary posted to mental health support groups on the website Reddit through subfora captures in real time the language used by those sharing and processing their pandemic experiences online. LDA Topic Modeling on Multiple Time FramesFigure 4 shows the distribution of posts in midpandemic mental health subreddits over the 10 topics extracted using LDA on prepandemic mental health subreddits as well as the 10 topics extracted using LDA on the midpandemic mental health subreddits. Convergent Findings Across Analyses: Health Anxiety and SuicidalityOur findings suggest the pandemic may have induced health anxiety among several mental health and non-mental health communities given that posts on r/COVID19 support were classified most frequently as belonging to r/healthanxiety, midpandemic posts from the r/anxiety subreddit became significantly enriched for posts from the health anxiety cluster, LDA topic analysis found the health anxiety topic significantly increased in the midpandemic posts compared to the prepandemic posts, and supervised dimensionality reduction revealed that the more users posted about COVID-19 the more similar subreddits became to r/healthanxiety.

> ABSTRACT
> 
> Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit.
> 
> Objective: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world’s largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non–mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic.
> 
> Methods: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.
> 
> Results: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress,” “isolation,” and “home,” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=–0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged.
> 
> Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.

## Singles who are satisfied with their friends are less likely to desire a relationship partner

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/singles-who-are-satisfied-with-their-friends-are-less-likely-to-desire-a-relationship-partner-58488):

> "My findings show that people that desire relationships at higher levels tend to assign their friends lower importance and are less satisfied with their social lives. And vice versa, singles with less relationship desire think their friends are more important and are also more satisfied with their social lives," he told PsyPost. "In short, these results show that singles with low relationship desire are more social and derive greater support from their friends. These findings also defy common negative perceptions of singles with low relationship desire as having social difficulties." "I would be happy to know more about the social net of singles. It might well be that singles with low relationship desire transfer some of the assumed responsibilities of the nuclear family to their networks of friends and I want to know more about how it looks like and about what shapes communities of singles these days," Kislev said.

## New fMRI study finds that language production appears to be hardwired in the left brain of adults — but comprehension is more flexibly shared across hemispheres. Helps explain why adults might be better able to understand, but not speak, a new language.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/adult-language-learning-change-the-brain):

> To answer this question and determine how adult language learning influences plasticity and lateralization, they used functional magnetic resonance technology to compare the brain activity between hemispheres while adult language learners read, listened, and spoke in their native and new languages. Early on in the language learning process, native and new languages looked quite similar in the brain, suggesting people accessed their new language through their native language. Growing evidence shows learning a new language can represent a "Powerful tool to reorganize brain neuroplasticity." Studies show that even relatively short, months-long language learning programs can help reshape brain networks, improve global cognition, and increase functional connectivity in aging people's brains.

## More than 1.2 million people in the US prevented facing death following a cancer diagnosis, between the year 2000 and 2016, thanks to ever improving treatment options. In 2016 alone, new treatments were associated with 156,749 fewer cancer deaths for the 15 most common tumor types.

> More than 1.2 million people in the US prevented facing death following a cancer diagnosis, between the year 2000 and 2016, thanks to ever improving treatment options - a large new national study shows. Published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Economics, the new findings highlight how new drugs commissioned during this period to target the 15 most common cancer types helped to reduce mortality by 24% per 100,000 people in the States. Other limitations of the study include that new treatment interventions were limited to cancer pharmaceutical interventions and did not account for non-pharmaceutical innovations, such as robotic surgery, advances in radiotherapy and other surgical techniques, which may also affect cancer mortality.
