## Scientists have discovered a new method that makes it possible to transform electricity into hydrogen or chemical products by solely using microwaves - without cables and without any type of contact with electrodes. It has great potential to store renewable energy and produce both synthetic fuels.

> Two points should be kept in mind to temper your enthusiastic for the significance of this work:
> 
> 1.  Efficiency is a critical metric.  I don't see a mention of it in the press release or abstract, but I would not be surprised if the efficiency was worse than conventional electrolysis.  There would be no interest in large scale application if this if that is the case.
> 
> 2.  Even a perfect 100% efficiency, zero-hardware-cost electricity-to-hydrogen system would do little to change the fundamentals of where and to what extent hydrogen is useful in energy systems.  A key limitation is the efficiency of fuel cells, which makes electric - H2 - electric systems about half the efficiency of batteries.
> 
> Moving forward, world energy systems will use significant hydrogen, and research advances are useful, even if they only improve our understanding and aren't directly applicable beyond the lab.   So I am happy to see this research.

## Grandiose narcissists' overconfidence, impulsivity, and a willingness to ignore expert advice results in a higher likelihood of making a bad decision. In addition, after getting the wrong answer, grandiose narcissists are more likely to blame others and remain self-confident in their judgment.

## After Obamacare's 2014 Medicaid Expansion, states that expanded Medicaid gained significantly more access to preventative cardiovascular drugs (for cholesterol, hypertension, etc.). This will likely narrow health disparities by reducing rates of heart attacks, strokes, & death among the poorest.

## President Trump’s use of Twitter diverts crucial media from topics that are potentially harmful to him or that he considers threatening. The pattern is absent in placebo analyses involving other topics that do not present a political risk to the president.

## The more secondhand tobacco smoke children breathe while growing up, the higher their chance of developing markers of decreased heart function as adults. New study found higher levels of secondhand tobacco smoke exposure in children linked to decreased left ventricular global longitudinal strain.
