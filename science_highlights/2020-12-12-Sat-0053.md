## A healthy gut microbiome contributes to normal brain function. Scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors in mice, by causing a reduction in endogenous cannabinoids.

## Rampant partisanship in the US may be the largest obstacle to reduced social mobility critical to limiting spread of COVID-19. Partisanship is more important than public health concerns for explaining willingness to reduce mobility. This effect has grown over time, especially among Republicans.

## Male patients with COVID-19 are 3 times more likely to require intensive care, and have about a 40% higher death rate. With few exceptions, the sex bias observed in COVID-19 is a worldwide phenomenon.( N=3,111,714)

> This has been observed from the beginning with COVID-19. Back in July, I watched a Yale University COVID-19 seminar on disparate effects in women vs. men. The main presenter was Dr. Iwasaki. Her study was published in Nature in August:

> The take-homes:
> 
> * Women show strong T cell activation regardless of age, which may be a major factor in why women are doing better. Women also produced more antibodies on average (although not enough to reach significance at this sample size).
> * Men show sharply declining T cell activation vs. age, so older men are at high risk compared to older women. Men may also be ramping up their innate immune response to compensate: higher IL-8, IL-18, and inflammatory monocytes compared to women. This puts them at risk for cytokine storms.
> 
> The corollary to this is that when you stratify patients by those who are doing well vs. poorly, T cell activation was prognostic in men (up = good), and inflammatory markers are prognostic in women (up = bad).
> 
> Since women who are doing poorly show increased inflammatory markers like men, they're probably good candidates for anti-inflammatory treatments. And older men may benefit particularly from a vaccine, which will probably trigger T cell activation better than natural infection.

## Ravens parallel great apes in physical and social cognitive skills - the first large-scale assessment of common ravens compared with chimpanzees and orangutans found full-blown cognitive skills present in ravens at the age of 4 months similar to that of adult apes, including theory of mind.

> It seems like now we are starting to take the idea of animal intelligence more seriously, particularly intelligence in animals that aren't much like humans otherwise.

> I think at one time (many years ago) people questioned the idea that animals were even conscious or capable of feeling emotion. People saw them as soulless and mindless creatures put on earth to serve us.

## Strong social support decreases mental health problems in young adults. People who experienced greater levels of social support experienced 47% less severe depression and 22% less anxiety than those with less social support, and 40% decreased risk of experiencing suicidal ideation and attempts

## Invisible structures generated by gravitational interactions in the Solar System have created a "space superhighway" network, astronomers have discovered. This network can transport objects from Jupiter to Neptune in a matter of decades, rather than the much longer timescales.

## Cheese, by far, was shown to be the most protective food against age-related cognitive problems. Daily consumption of alcohol, particularly red wine, and weekly consumption of lamb, but not other red meats, was related to improvements in cognitive function, finds first-of-its-kind analysis.
