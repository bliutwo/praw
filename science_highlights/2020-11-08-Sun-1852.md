## Adults exposed to high traffic-related air pollution are more likely to experience mental disorders. For each 5 microgram per cubic meter increase in very small particulate matter and 3 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide odds of mental disorders were increased by 18% to 39%.

## A new type of soil created by engineers can pull water from the air and distribute it to plants, potentially expanding the map of farmable land around the globe to previously inhospitable places and reducing water use in agriculture at a time of growing droughts.

## Game combats political misinformation by letting players undermine democracy: A short online game in which players are recruited as a “Chief Disinformation Officer” and use tactics like trolling to sabotage elections in a peaceful town has shown to reduce susceptibility to political misinformation

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/game-combats-political-misinformation-by-letting-players-undermine-democracy):

> In this case, by understanding how to incite political division in the game using everything from bots and conspiracies to fake experts, players get a form of "Psychological vaccine" against the product of these techniques in the real world. In the 10-minute game Harmony Square, a small town neighbourhood "Obsessed with democracy" comes under fire as players bait the square's "Living statute", spread falsehoods about its candidate for "Bear controller", and set up a disreputable online news site to attack the local TV anchor. "The effect size suggests that if the population was split equally like the study sample, 63% of the half that played the game would go on to find misinformation significantly less reliable, compared to just 37% of the half left to navigate online information without the inoculation of Harmony Square," he said.

> There's an indie game very similar to this that I encourage you guys to check out; it's titled Headliner, and basically you're the editor of a newspaper, and the articles you choose have impacts on your city, ranging from immigration issues to corporation takeovers.

## A blue-green glow adds to platypuses’ long list of bizarre features

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur):

> Anich's hunch is that it helps camouflage the mostly nocturnal platypuses from nighttime predators that have UV vision, since, by absorbing some of the UV light, platypuses reflect less of it. All known cases of fluorescence in mammals occur in species that are active at night or the low light of dawn and dusk, so Anich thinks the glow has something to do with darkness. Even if not, the glowing fur certainly adds to platypuses' reputation for bizarreness.

`/u/soupjuice` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jqd091/a_bluegreen_glow_adds_to_platypuses_long_list_of/):

> Platypuses probably talk when we aren't around, like Toy Story. They sense our presence and clam-up.

## Arctic animals are migrating earlier in the year due to climate change

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2259144-arctic-animals-are-migrating-earlier-in-the-year-due-to-climate-change/):

> Animals in the Arctic, including reindeer and golden eagles, are migrating earlier due to climate change, say researchers who have gathered a huge amount of data to study the behaviour of 86 Arctic species over the past three decades. The Arctic is experiencing some of the worst-known effects of climate change, warming twice as fast as the global average. Golden eagles - which usually nest in the Arctic tundra - have been starting their spring migration half a day earlier each year over the past 25 years.

> At least they’re adapting?
