## Research found autistic adults were nearly nine times more likely than non-autistic peers to report using recreational drugs (such as marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines) to manage unwanted symptoms, including autism-related symptoms.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-may-be-more-likely-to-use-recreational-drugs-to-self-medicate-their-mental):

> Some studies indicate that autistic individuals are less likely to use substances, whereas others suggest that autistic individuals are at greater risk of substance misuse or abuse. Despite lower rates of substance use overall, the qualitative findings of the study provide a much less hopeful picture: autistic adults were nearly nine times more likely than non-autistic peers to report using recreational drugs to manage unwanted symptoms, including autism-related symptoms. The findings of the new study indicate that autistic individuals are over four times more likely to report vulnerability associated with substance use compared to their non-autistic peers, including dependence/addiction, using drugs to deal with past trauma, and substance use associated with suicide.

## AI Designs Quantum Physics Experiments Beyond What Any Human Has Conceived

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-designs-quantum-physics-experiments-beyond-what-any-human-has-conceived/):

> Krenn stumbled on this entire research program somewhat by accident when he and his colleagues were trying to figure out how to experimentally create quantum states of photons entangled in a very particular manner: When two photons interact, they become entangled, and both can only be mathematically described using a single shared quantum state. In 1989 three physicists-Daniel Greenberger, the late Michael Horne and Zeilinger-described an entangled state that came to be known as "GHZ". It involved four photons, each of which could be in a quantum superposition of, say, two states, 0 and 1. Besides generating complex entangled states, the setup using more than two crystals with overlapping paths can be employed to perform a generalized form of Zeilinger's 1994 quantum interference experiments with two crystals.

`/u/adkayaker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oc9d23/ai_designs_quantum_physics_experiments_beyond/):

> This is what people have theorized for a while about how quantum computing will help with our understanding of physics. Designing experiments can be really useful but AI has the problems with understanding. There have been some mathematical proofs for example that have been solved by computers but they don’t give the same understanding that a human done proof would be. 
> 
> My point is, if we run these experiments and it tells us some result, without understanding the AI’s “thought process” are we going to be able to meaningfully interpret the results of the experiments?

## British consumers complicit in forty-year ‘healthy eating’ failure, new study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/british-consumers-complicit-in-forty-year-healthy-eating-failure-new-study-suggests):

> In an article published in Contemporary British History, Moseley argues that far from being passive victims of manipulation in this period, consumers were 'complicit' in long-term behavioural shifts, proactively selecting, rejecting and sweetening advice from the government, the food industry and the media to fit their circumstances and to satisfy their appetites. Moseley said: "For health enthusiasts and cynics alike, official information about food didn't always feel correct. Consumers continued to assert that foods had different effects on different individuals, that one could be overweight whilst leading a healthy lifestyle, and that - in the midst of a dizzying array of information, self-evaluation was key." The study describes how supermarkets and food manufacturers seized on the idea of 'healthy eating' in the 1980s in response to new nutritional guidelines being issued.

> What a strange title, I don’t think it reflects the article very well at all. From the article I mostly got that dietary information is confusing and often contradictory so people tend to interpret it in their own ways. I don’t see how that can be blamed on consumers.

## Low-income patients may be less likely to receive medical assistance in dying

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/puww-lpm070121.php):

> In Canada, low-income hospital patients under palliative care are less likely to receive medical assistance in dying compared to those who are high income, according to a study published in British Medical Journal Open. Patients with low socioeconomic status generally tend to experience less access to medical care compared to their high SES counterparts. The team explored the association between socioeconomic status and medical assistance in dying by identifying hospital patients aged 65 and older in Ontario, Canada between June 2016 and 2019.

> For those who may not know but want a quick piece of advice from someone being educated to do counseling.
> 
> Having strong familiar relationships like family and friends is immensely important it was hard at first because I struggle with depression but the time and effort are worth it if your family is relatively stable and functioning. Obviously abusive family is a different story. 
> 
> That’s the basic social framework that creates a strong foundation of your support network.
> 
> Eating well and exercising regularly are also immensely important as the mind-body connection is better and you are nutritionally stable which lends itself to improved cognitive function and self-esteem. 
> 
> Having things that bring you joy like reading or playing video games for when you have down time to rest and play allows you to recharge and go back into the world refreshed. 
> 
> Getting consistent and quality sleep is crucial. 
> 
> Listening to understand others, and not solely to reply. 
> 
> Having an attitude of gratitude and being thankful for the small things you have like shelter and people who care about you.
> 
> And of course having a goal and direction so that you don’t feel lost and become stagnant. 
> 
> A lot of this seems like very obvious or basic information but you’d be surprised how many people simply just don’t know. 
> 
> Hope this helps if not that’s okay too.

## More greenhouse gases were produced in 2018 than any previous year, despite more than 20 countries reducing their carbon emissions since 2000, research from an international group of scientists has shown

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/they-just-kept-rising-data-reveals-alarming-greenhouse-gas-increase):

> While the COVID-19 pandemic may have brought about a temporary reprieve in carbon emission, experts have forecast a return to the previous upward trajectory of greenhouse gas production after observing economic growth moving back to previous levels. "The main thing we found is that almost everywhere we looked, and in almost every sector, greenhouse gas emissions just kept on rising, right up to the beginning of COVID-19, when we had the highest greenhouse gas emissions we've ever had," Prof. Wiedmann says. Lead author of the study, researcher Dr. William Lamb from Berlin's Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, says global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 11 per cent from 2010 to 2018.
