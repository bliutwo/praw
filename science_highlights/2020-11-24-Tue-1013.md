## Dolphins can consciously slow down their hearts before diving, and can even adjust their heart rate depending on how long they plan to dive for. The findings provide new insights into how marine mammals conserve oxygen and adjust to pressure while diving to avoid “the bends”.

> they "avoid the bends" by not breathing high pressure air/nitrogen so their tissues and blood stream never get super saturated with nitrogen. 
> 
> could anyone explain how any air breathing aquatic animal *could* get the bends without using SCUBA gear?

## Financial payments from the drug industry to U.S. physicians was associated with increased prescribing of the paying drug company's drug. The association was consistent across all studies and several studies presented evidence that the association was not correlation, but causation.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/acop-fpf111720.php):

> Financial payments from drug industry associated with physician prescribing. A systematic review of published research found that financial payments from the drug industry to U.S. physicians was associated with increased prescribing of the paying drug company's drug. Researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center reviewed 36 published studies comprising 101 analysis to evaluate whether receipt of payments from the drug industry is associated with physician prescribing practices.

> Now let's remember that nurse practitioners are not required to report payments like physicians are. But I'm sure there's nothing to see there...

## Scientists showed that glycine, the simplest amino acid and an important building block of life, can form in dense interstellar clouds well before they transform into new stars and planets. Glycine can form on the surface of icy dust grains, in the absence of energy, through ‘dark chemistry'.

Summary of [original article](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2020/se/building-blocks-of-life-can-form-long-before-stars.html):

> The results, published in Nature Astronomy, suggest that glycine, and very likely other amino acids, form in dense interstellar clouds well before they transform into new stars and planets. The detection of glycine in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and in samples returned to Earth from the Stardust mission suggests that amino acids, such as glycine, form long before stars. Dr Sergio Ioppolo, from Queen Mary University of London and lead author of the article, said: "Dark chemistry refers to chemistry without the need of energetic radiation. In the laboratory we were able to simulate the conditions in dark interstellar clouds where cold dust particles are covered by thin layers of ice and subsequently processed by impacting atoms causing precursor species to fragment and reactive intermediates to recombine."

## Scientists find hidden ‘super planet’ in breakthrough observation

> Astronomers have discovered a cold brown dwarf - otherwise known as a "Super planet" - for the first time using a radio telescope. While brown dwarfs do not undertake fusion reactions, they do emit light at radio wavelengths in a similar way that Jupiter does - accelerating charged particles like electrons to produce radiation including radio waves and aurorae. "We asked ourselves, 'Why point our radio telescope at catalogued brown dwarfs?'" said Harish Vedantham, lead author of the study and astronomer at ASTRON. "Let's just make a large image of the sky and discover these objects directly in the radio."

## For the first time scientists have made a discovery of hallucinogenic drug remains at the site of an early California cave painting. These drug remnants were discovered in the ceiling of Pinwheel Cave and could change scientists’ understanding of how the community used that space -- and the drugs.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/native-californian-rock-art-hallucinogens):

> Robinson and his colleagues also found remnants which suggest the cave was used widely - there's evidence of hunting, gathering, cooking, eating, and potentially storage taking place in the Pinwheel Cave. A painting possibly representing the flowers of Datura on the ceiling of a Californian rock art site called Pinwheel Cave was discovered alongside fibrous quids in the same ceiling. Even though Native Californians are historically documented to have used Datura to enter trance states, little evidence exists to associate it with rock art.

`/u/DoctorCrocker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzpeak/for_the_first_time_scientists_have_made_a/):

> Woah, Datura. That’s supposed to be *highly* unpleasant

## COVID-19 cases could nearly double before Biden takes office. Proven model developed by Washington University, which accurately forecasted the rate of COVID-19 growth over the summer of 2020, predicts 20 million infected Americans by late January.

Summary of [original article](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/11/covid-19-cases-could-nearly-double-before-biden-takes-office/):

> The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are likely to increase to 20 million by the end of January, nearly doubling the current level of 11.4 million cases, predicts a Washington University in St. Louis COVID-19 forecasting model. If we continue, as a nation, at the current level of social distancing, the model forecasts that we are likely to reach 20 million cases before the end of January 2021. "However, more recently, testing has increased, and probably more like 25% of cases are diagnosed. In that case, total COVID cases would increase beyond 20 million in the next few months unless we, as a society, engage in more social distancing."

`/u/KombatSpyder` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzgtlf/covid19_cases_could_nearly_double_before_biden/):

> I honestly think the reason the numbers are going up is that many people no longer care. Some people never did, but many did for a long time. They are now burnt out and want to live their lives regardless of the consequences. It may not be the right thing to do, and I agree it's selfish, but many people no longer give a $h1t.
