## New study links psychopathic tendencies to racial prejudice and right-wing authoritarianism. People with calloused, deceitful, and manipulative interpersonal styles are more likely to endorse right-wing authoritarianism and express hostile attitudes towards marginalized groups.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/new-study-links-psychopathic-tendencies-to-racial-prejudice-and-right-wing-authoritarianism-58852):

> "The findings of the study suggest that psychopathic traits, particularly the calloused and deceptive traits, are robustly associated with the tendency to prefer a society that keeps marginalized groups low in status and power and are also predictive of the propensity to use aggression towards violators of traditional social norms, both of which are salient predictors of a variety of prejudicial attitudes," Roy explained to PsyPost. Roy's new study also found evidence that psychopathic tendencies were directly tied to prejudicial views. "A major caveat is that the study was conducted with young adults so further research in populations clinically elevated in psychopathy is warranted. Additionally, the current study mainly used self-report measures for both personality and prejudice so future studies using different assessment methods like clinical ratings and behavioral tasks indexing prejudice can certainly help further our understanding of these associations," Roy noted.

## Octopuses observed "punching" fishes that are part of their hunting groups. Sometimes done to steal prey, but other times it appears to be done just out of spite.

## Study suggests the link between disgust and interracial romance is no longer strong or widespread. The new findings are in line with public opinion polling, which in 2013 found that 11% of Americans disapproved of marriages between Blacks and Whites, compared to 94% who disapproved in 1958.

> 
> -How the gender of each race impacts how its perceived (e.g. is black woman/white man more frowned upon than  white woman/black man?)

## Salt-tolerant bacteria with an appetite for sludge make biodegradable plastics

Summary of [original article](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2020/12/salt-tolerant-bacteria-with-an-appetite-for-sludge-make-biodegradable-plastics.html):

> In the September issue of the journal American Chemical Society Omega, the researchers have shown that the bacterium Zobellella denitrificans ZD1, found in mangroves, can consume sludge and wastewater to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a type of biopolymer that can be used in lieu of petroleum-based plastics. In particular, an abundance of carbon sources and a depletion of either nitrogen, phosphorous or oxygen, cause bacteria to erratically consume their carbon sources and produce polyhydroxybutyrate as a stress response. One such medium that can force bacteria to make polyhydroxybutyrate is crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel manufacturing.

## Green tea extract enhances parieto-frontal connectivity during working memory processing

Summary of [original article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24643507/):

> Objectives: This study investigates whether the intake of green tea extract modulates effective brain connectivity during working memory processing and whether connectivity parameters are related to task performance. Results: Green tea extract increased the working memory induced modulation of connectivity from the right superior parietal lobule to the middle frontal gyrus. Modeling effective connectivity among frontal and parietal brain regions during working memory processing might help to assess the efficacy of green tea for the treatment of cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders such as dementia.

## One-third of large rivers in the United States have changed colour over the past 35 years. Some US waterways have become greener and others yellower, providing clues to ecosystem health.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03592-8):

> One-third of large rivers in the United States have changed colour over the past 35 years. The team classified rivers across the United States as yellow, green or blue and catalogued colour changes over three and a half decades. The northwestern United States was a hotspot for rivers that became greener over time, whereas in the northeast, rivers were more likely to turn yellower.

## "Given the unique traits found in SARS‐CoV‐2 and all the open questions there still are around its emergence, until either a natural or laboratory origin is conclusively demonstrated both avenues should be robustly investigated by the scientific community."

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bies.202000091):

> Especially since serial passage through a live animal host simply forces the same molecular processes that occur in nature to happen during a zoonotic jump, and in vitro passage through cell culture mimics many elements of this process-and neither necessarily leaves any distinguishing genetic traces. Several factors weigh into the probability that coronaviruses can gain furin cleavage sites following serial passage: The frequency of evolutionary motifs meant to deal with virus-host interactions that are often shared between viruses, the observations that when the infectious bronchitis coronavirus coronavirus is serially passed through chickens it developed notable mutations along its spikeâ€protein genes, and the fact that when a lineage A bovine coronavirus was subject to in vitro serial passage through cell lines, a 12â€nucleotide insert found within only a small minority of the pooled viruses spikeâ€protein region was strongly selected for and quickly emerged as the dominate strain. Further support for the possibility that serial passage through lab ferrets or throughout mink farms played a role in the genesis of this novel coronavirus is provided by a preprint that notes the obvious ease with which it passes through the air between ferrets, since SARSâ€CoVâ€2 was transmitted through the air to three out of four indirect recipient ferrets monitored for airborne passage of the novel coronavirus.

## Newly discovered orchid species labelled the ugliest in the world

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2263273-newly-discovered-orchid-species-labelled-the-ugliest-in-the-world/):

> Orchids are usually seen as beautifully coloured flowers, but a newly discovered species from Madagascar is far from pretty. "I'm sure it's mother thinks it's very lovely," says Johan Hermans at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, who discovered the species. Like most orchids, this species is a perennial plant, meaning it could live for many years, and has a symbiotic relationship with a fungus.
