> In the country where I live - Costa Rica - we have had a mask mandate from the get-go.  Our Minister of Health is a doctor with a specialty in Epidemiology.  There were also other important protocols put in place for being in public and days when people could drive and couldn't drive.  
> 
> It's been a battle, but more than 70% of the population is vaccinated and we are down to just over 100 new cases per day ( population around 5.5 million).  We are lucky to have him - Dr. Daniel Sala Peraza - and we are lucky our legislators listened to him.

## Study: Psychotherapy May Fail to Help Over 50% of Depressed Patients

Summary of [original article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/finding-new-home/202111/study-psychotherapy-may-fail-help-over-50-depressed-patients):

> Cuijpers and collaborators, in a study published in the September issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, suggest that over half of patients who receive psychotherapy for depression do not respond to the treatment. In evaluating effective psychotherapies for depression, an important question is: What percentage of patients who receive psychotherapy for depression get better? And what percentage no longer meet the criteria for depression? The answer to these questions requires calculating the treatment response and remission rates, respectively. In summary, although psychotherapies for depression work, "More than half of patients receiving therapy did not respond and only one third remitted. Furthermore, 16%-17% also respond when they are in a waitlist or control conditions."

## Scientists have found exercise increases the body’s own cannabis-like substances, which in turn helps reduce inflammation and could potentially help treat certain conditions such as arthritis, cancer and heart disease.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/exercise-increases-the-bodys-own-cannabis):

> Exercise increases the body's own cannabis-like substances, which in turn helps reduce inflammation and could potentially help treat certain conditions such as arthritis, cancer and heart disease. In a new study, published in Gut Microbes, experts from the University of Nottingham found that exercise intervention in people with arthritis, did not just reduce their pain, but it also lowered the levels of inflammatory substances. Exercise is known to decrease chronic inflammation, which in turn causes many diseases including cancer, arthritis and heart disease, but little is known as to how it reduces inflammation.

## Adults who experienced adverse childhood experiences like childhood sexual or physical abuse or chronic parental domestic violence were three times more likely to have a generalized anxiety disorder. 60% of those with ADHD who had anxiety disorders had experienced at least one of these experiences.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/935302):

> Those with ADHD were four times more likely to have GAD at some point in their life, when compared to those without ADHD. Even after controlling for other relevant factors, including sociodemographics, adverse childhood experiences, and a lifetime history of substance use disorders and major depressive disorders, those with ADHD still had more than double the odds of GAD. "These findings underline how vulnerable adults with ADHD are to generalized anxiety disorders," says lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson, professor at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and Director of the Institute for Life Course & Aging. The study identified several factors that were associated with GAD among those with ADHD. Female respondents with ADHD had nearly five times higher odds of GAD, even after controlling for other covariates. Investigators examined a nationally representative sample of 6,898 respondents from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health aged 20-39, of whom 272 had ADHD and 682 had GAD. Unfortunately, the researchers did not have access to information on what treatments, if any, respondents with ADHD were receiving to address their anxiety.

> I experienced them all. I also have GAD, Panic Disorder, and C-PTSD. When you are repeatedly in traumatic situations it will inevitably have an effect on your psyche. Its like a phantom vibration. Your body gets used to the sensation of the vibration of your phone, almost like an imprint. Then you start to feel it even when there is no vibration. Thats what repeated exposure to trauma is like, for me. Those feelings; the fear, confusion, adrenaline, etc. are almost imprinted into my psyche. So that I feel those feelings without a threat being present.

## 15 Minutes Of Strength Training A Day Increases Endocannabinoids, Reduces Pain And Inflammation -

Summary of [original article](https://www.highandpolite.co.uk/cbdnews/15-minutes-of-strength-training-a-day-increases-endocannabinoids-reduces-pain-and-inflammation):

> Just 15 minutes of strength training each day is enough to boost your natural endocannabinoid levels and reduce pain and inflammation, according to a new study. At the end of the six weeks, participants who did the daily exercise reduced their pain, had higher levels of endocannabinoids and lower levels of cytokines, as well as having more microbes in their guts of the kind that produce anti-inflammatory compounds. The increase in endocannabinoid levels was strongly linked to changes in the gut microbes and anti-inflammatory substances produced by gut microbes called SCFAS. In fact, it was found that at least one third of the anti-inflammatory effects of the gut microbiome was due to the increase in endocannabinoids.

## Vaccinated Health Care Workers Shed Less COVID-19 Virus Than Unvaccinated. Seventy percent of the infections were among unvaccinated workers, compared with 30% of those who had received at least one vaccine dose.

Summary of [original article](https://consumer.healthday.com/b-11-18-vaccinated-healthcare-workers-shed-less-covid-19-virus-than-unvaccinated-2655743070.html):

> THURSDAY, Nov. 18, 2021 - Vaccinated health care workers with breakthrough COVID-19 infections shed less virus than those who are unvaccinated and infected, according to University of California, Los Angeles researchers. For the new study, the researchers analyzed data on 880 UCLA health care workers who tested positive for COVID infection between Dec. 16, 2020 - when vaccines first became available at the university - and March 31, 2021. More virus was found in samples taken from infected workers who had not yet been vaccinated than in those from infected employees who had received any of three vaccines used in the United States.

`/u/wwarnout` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qwq70d/vaccinated_health_care_workers_shed_less_covid19/):

> The fact that there are still healthcare workers that haven't been vaccinated is a disgrace to our healthcare system, and another indication of just how stupid and selfish the average American is.
