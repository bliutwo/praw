## Psychedelic researchers who admit to using the substances themselves tend to be viewed as having less integrity compared to their abstinent counterparts. The new study suggests that stereotypes about psychedelics and their users can impact people’s perceptions of scientists.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/02/self-admitted-psychedelic-use-and-association-with-psychedelic-culture-harm-perception-of-researchers-scientific-integrity-59545):

> Psychedelic researchers who admit to using the substances themselves tend to be viewed as having less integrity compared to their abstinent counterparts, according to new research that surveyed 952 individuals from the United States. The findings indicate that "Both self-admitted personal use of psychedelic and association with the psychedelic subculture can negatively affect the public's perception of those researchers and/or their findings - to different degrees," Forstmann told PsyPost. The study, "How psychedelic researchers' self-admitted substance use and their association with psychedelic culture affect people's perceptions of their scientific integrity and the quality of their research", was authored by Matthias Forstmann and Christina Sagioglou.

## New study finds the number of Americans reporting "extreme" mental distress grew from 3.5% in 1993 to 6.4% in 2019; "extreme distress" here is defined as reporting serious emotional problems and mental distress in all 30 of the past 30 days

## An experimental single-dose, intranasal influenza vaccine was safe and produced a durable immune response when tested in a Phase 1 study. The vaccine platform could be highly adaptable for use against other viruses including HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

Summary of [original article](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/intranasal-influenza-vaccine-spurs-strong-immune-response-phase-1-study):

> An experimental single-dose, intranasal influenza vaccine was safe and produced a durable immune response when tested in a Phase 1 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Volunteers who received the intranasal vaccine had high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies at 26 weeks after vaccination, and this level was unchanged at three to five years after a single intranasal dose of the vaccine. The intranasal vaccine induced a mucosal antibody response in the nose, mouth, and rectum.

## Researchers have built an artificial intelligence (AI) that generates new mathematical formulae — including some as-yet unsolved problems that continue to challenge mathematicians. Ramanujan Machine is designed to generate new ways of calculating digits of important mathematical constants, such as π

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00304-8):

> Researchers have built an artificial intelligence that can generate new mathematical formulae - including some as-yet unsolved problems that continue to challenge mathematicians. The techniques in the Ramanujan Machine's algorithms existed before, says mathematician Doron Zeilberger at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. More recently, some mathematicians have made progress towards AI that doesn't just perform repetitive calculations, but develops its own proofs.
