## The geographic distribution of death sentences in the United States is clustered in just a few jurisdictions. The findings indicate that a county’s legal and racial history plays a more important role than the homicide rate.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/05/new-study-explains-why-a-few-counties-generate-most-of-the-death-sentences-in-the-united-states-60317):

> New research published in PLOS One sheds light on why the geographic distribution of death sentences in the United States is clustered in just a few jurisdictions. "There have been about 9,000 death sentences in the United States since 1972, and about 1,500 executions," Baumgartner said. "The findings are very strong with regards to death sentences, even stronger than in the earlier paper. So our point was not to identify something new; the fact of high concentration of use of the death penalty in just a few jurisdictions was already known. Rather, we explored where it comes from: Learning. Some counties get very good at it. Some never do."

## Greenhouse gases are slowly shrinking the middle atmosphere - Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are cooling and shrinking the stratosphere and mesosphere, a phenomenon observed for the first time in a new analysis of satellite data.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/greenhouse-gases-are-slowly-shrinking-the-middle-atmosphere/):

> Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are cooling and shrinking the stratosphere and mesosphere, a phenomenon observed for the first time in a new analysis of satellite data. Unlike the nitrogen and oxygen gases that make up most of the atmosphere, greenhouse gases absorb and emit heat in the form of infrared light. Instead, the new results flesh out how greenhouse gases change the atmosphere beyond near-surface warming, and they can be used to improve scientific models of the atmosphere.

## This new Harvard study is the first large-scale, controlled investigation to demonstrate an association between gender-affirming surgeries and improved mental health outcomes in transgender people

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2779429):

> Question Are gender-affirming surgeries associated with better mental health outcomes among transgender and gender diverse people? Objective To evaluate associations between gender-affirming surgeries and mental health outcomes, including psychological distress, substance use, and suicide risk. Conclusions and Relevance This study demonstrates an association between gender-affirming surgery and improved mental health outcomes.

> I think this study and the data used need to be contextualized.
> 
> The survey was created because, in part, no large-scale national surveys measured gender identity at the time; they generally still don’t. Hell, the US Census also asks no questions about gender identity, so we have no true population estimates of trans individuals (side note: the same is true for sexual identity, though they ask about living with a same-sex partner.)
> 
> A community-based non-respondent driven sample of 28,000 trans respondents has enormous value to our understanding of the diverse experiences of trans people in the US. It cannot tell us about loss to follow-up, self-selection bias, and other major issues with survey design. But neither can the large-scale national surveys we use to understand population prevalence in drug use, for example (NSDUH). It would be grossly unethical to randomize trans participants to surgery versus treatment as usual, so this analysis existing is interesting and important. (That is not to say it’s without flaws, just that the rush to condemn survey research among an under-researched population is dangerous and anti-science.)

## Volunteer firefighters — who comprise more than 65% of the U.S. fire service — have higher levels of “forever chemicals,” per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in their bodies than the general public. Levels of potentially health-threatening chemicals rise with years of service.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/volunteer-firefighters-have-higher-levels-forever-chemicals):

> Volunteer firefighters - who comprise more than 65 percent of the U.S. fire service - have higher levels of "Forever chemicals," per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in their bodies than the general public, according to a Rutgers study. The study, which was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, compared the levels of nine PFAS chemicals in the blood of volunteer firefighters against levels in the general population. The researchers found that the levels of two of the chemicals studied - perfluorododecanoic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid - were higher in volunteer firefighters.

> The sad thing is, I don't think the average person even knows that most Fire Departments are volunteer.... or the risks involved.

## Belief in conspiracies about the Covid-19 pandemic increased through the early months of the US outbreak among people who reported being heavy users of conservative and social media. Conservative media included sources like Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Breitbart News, One America News and Drudge Report.

## "Rather than directly acting on genes...the new CRISPR variant targets the biological machinery that naturally turns genes on or off."

Summary of [original article](https://singularityhub.com/2021/04/27/a-new-crispr-tool-flips-genes-on-and-off-like-a-light-switch/):

> Rather than directly acting on genes-irrevocably dicing away or swapping genetic letters-the new CRISPR variant targets the biological machinery that naturally turns genes on or off. Once the "Sleeping beauty" genes are ready to wake up, a complementary tool, CRISPRon, flips the light switch back on. In one experiment targeting over 20,000 genes inside immortalized human kidney cells with CRISPRoff, the team was able to reliably shut those genes off.

`/u/Saotik` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n3v795/rather_than_directly_acting_on_genesthe_new/):

> I can't remember much from the genetics degree I earned 15 years ago apart from a good principle that if you didn't know the answer to a question, the answer was probably either "epigenetics" or "methylation".
> 
> CRISPRoff is huge. Truly exciting technology.

## New research has shown that COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic provided an accurate sample of the general population, suggesting that data from healthcare workers could be used to estimate the severity of future viruses more quickly.

## Study: Dogs’ fearfulness has a strong link to aggressive behaviour, with fearful dogs many times more likely to behave aggressively. Moreover, older dogs are more likely to behave aggressively than younger ones. One of the potential reasons behind this can be pain caused by a disease.
