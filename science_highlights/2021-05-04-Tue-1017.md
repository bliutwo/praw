## Teens, tech and mental health: Oxford study finds no link - There remains "little association" between technology use and mental-health problems, a study of more than 430,000 10 to 15-year-olds suggests.

> There’s a difference between “tech” and social media. Social media is, unequivocally, damaging - as stated within, and the damage isn’t limited to teens. 
> 
> Tech - playing video games for long hours, watching TV for long hours - that would make sense for this article.

## The geographic distribution of death sentences in the United States is clustered in just a few jurisdictions. The findings indicate that a county’s legal and racial history plays a more important role than the homicide rate.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/05/new-study-explains-why-a-few-counties-generate-most-of-the-death-sentences-in-the-united-states-60317):

> New research published in PLOS One sheds light on why the geographic distribution of death sentences in the United States is clustered in just a few jurisdictions. "There have been about 9,000 death sentences in the United States since 1972, and about 1,500 executions," Baumgartner said. "The findings are very strong with regards to death sentences, even stronger than in the earlier paper. So our point was not to identify something new; the fact of high concentration of use of the death penalty in just a few jurisdictions was already known. Rather, we explored where it comes from: Learning. Some counties get very good at it. Some never do."

> Anyhow, I found the idea of death penalty self-reinforcement interesting. They quote a previous article that says: 
> 
> "Once an office assembles a staff that has handled a capital trial, it draws upon this capacity to pursue the death penalty in subsequent cases, which further augments the office’s institutional capacity to pursue the death penalty. This self-reinforcing dynamic between capacity and caseload makes it more likely for offices that obtain death sentences to seek the death penalty going forward. Conversely, offices that cease to obtain death penalties (or never obtained death penalties in the first place) may be less likely to reverse course as institutional capacity for death penalty sentencing erodes (or is never developed). … This path dependency may reflect practices of prosecutors who make the charging decisions whether to seek the death penalty, but it may also capture defense lawyering, judges, jurors, and other features of a county that make it more likely to continue to death sentence over time."

## Urban tree cover provides benefits to human health and well-being, but is inequitably distributed. In 92% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. Low-income blocks have 15.2% less tree cover and are 1.5⁰C hotter than high-income blocks.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249715):

> The National Land Cover Data Tree Canopy Cover datasets provide a measure of change in tree cover over five years across the US but their 30m resolution has been found to systematically underestimate urban tree cover because small patches of tree canopy are often not detected , particularly in landscapes below 30% tree cover and above 70% cover. Overall, our results suggest that prior studies that examined tree cover within particular municipalities may find a smaller difference in tree cover between low-income and high income blocks than would exist across an entire urbanized area, because US urbanized areas are subdivided into jurisdictions that often have different income distributions. For the 100 urbanized areas we studied, we found that inequality in tree cover was correlated with differences in the average population density found in low- and high-income blocks, consistent with other studies in the literature that have discussed demographic patterns relative to tree cover patterns [85, 86]. As in other studies , accounting for covariates and spatial autocorrelation reduced the strength of the association between income and tree cover, but income was still significantly associated with tree cover in 78% of the urbanized areas studied.

## Lower self-control is associated with higher loneliness at both personality trait and momentary state levels. Self-control failures that have negative implications for others lead to higher risks for being ostracized by others, which predicts increased feelings of loneliness over time.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672211007228):

> Since low self-control has been associated with both, low prosocial disposition and norm violations, we explored whether low self-control elicits ostracism due to perceptions of a lack of prosocial disposition or inability to follow cultural norms, including norms prohibiting other-harming behaviors. Second, to test whether the feeling of loneliness prospectively predicts self-control failures, we regressed self-control failures on day t on loneliness on day t−1 and self-control failures on day t−1. The prospective effect of self-control failures on loneliness was significant: experiencing self-control failures on one day predicted feeling lonely on the following day; whereas the prospective effect of loneliness on self-control failures did not reach significance.
