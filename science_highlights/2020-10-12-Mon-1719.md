> >We also include a continuous measure for household net income in euros.
> 
> For anyone who was also interested; yes they did take into account that same sex couples with children are often richer (since things like adoption are a lot more expensive than a broken condom).
> 
> On top of income they also used neighbourhood indicators (to distinguish wealthy and poor neighbourhoods), parental age (same-sex parents often have children later in life), number of children (same-sex parents often have fewer children), and whether the parents were married, cohabitation or had another family structure. 
> 
> They had more variables of course, but these were the ones I thought people who just read the title might want to know about.

## Confusion (53%) was the most common neurologic manifestation in patients with COVID-19, followed by impaired consciousness (39%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). Ischemic strokes (27%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings.

Summary of [original article](https://n.neurology.org/content/95/13/e1868):

> AbstractObjective To describe neuroimaging findings and to report the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with neurologic manifestations. 9,-,13.The first studies that focused on clinical features of patients with COVID-191,2,11 showed neurologic manifestations such as headache, dizziness, confusion, hypogeusia, hyposmia, and more severe neurologic disorders, especially for patients hospitalized in intensive care units. Fourth, although patients with COVID-19 may develop a wide range of neurologic symptoms, which can be associated with ischemic stroke or encephalitis, it is difficult to state without a controlled general neurologic population that such events are more frequent in patients with COVID-19.

> I wonder how many of those people had low oxygen levels, which can cause all those symptoms.

## The raging lung inflammation that can contribute to death from the flu can be stopped in its tracks by a drug derived from MG53, a naturally occurring human protein, a new study in mice suggests. The treatment protects lungs without killing the flu virus.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/stopping-lethal-lung-damage-from-the-flu-with-a-natural-human-protein/):

> Already identified as a potential therapy for conditions ranging from Alzheimer's disease to persistent skin wounds, MG53 was found in this study to prevent death from a lethal flu infection by blocking excessive inflammation - without having any effect on the virus itself. In the July 17 issue of Nature Communications, Sermersheim was the first author of a study showing that the lungs of mice lacking the MG53 gene and infected with flu responded with extensive inflammation compared to normal mice - indicating that MG53 has a protective role in the immune response. Even teeming with the flu virus, the airways of treated mice showed little tissue damage.

## An examination of racial differences in the disciplining of police officers in three of the largest U.S. cities consistently found that Black officers were more frequently disciplined for misconduct than White officers, despite an essentially equal number of allegations being leveled.

## After the first peak, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a due to weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent US response to the pandemic.

## For every two deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S., a third American dies as a result of the pandemic, according to new data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

Summary of [original article](https://news.vcu.edu/article/Total_deaths_recorded_during_the_pandemic_far_exceed_those_attributed):

> Deaths attributed to COVID-19 only accounted for 67% of those deaths. The gap between reported COVID-19 deaths and all unexpected deaths can be partially explained by delays in reporting COVID-19 deaths, miscoding or other data limitations, Woolf said. Given questions about the accuracy of national coronavirus mortality numbers, all-cause excess mortality estimates may give a more complete picture about the effects of the pandemic in the U.S. Researchers report that all-cause US deaths increased a relative 20% during March-July 2020, with COVID-19 accounting for only 67% of the excess.

## Dopamine and serotonin are at work at sub-second speeds to shape how people perceive the world and take action. Researchers can measure the activity of dopamine and serotonin — whose receptor and uptake sites are therapeutic targets for disorders from depression to Parkinson’s disease.

Summary of [original article](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2020/10/neurochemical-fralinbiomed-1009.html):

> In first-of-their-kind observations in the human brain, an international team of researchers has revealed two well-known neurochemicals - dopamine and serotonin - are at work at sub-second speeds to shape how people perceive the world and take action based on their perception. The discovery shows researchers can continually and simultaneously measure the activity of both dopamine and serotonin - whose receptor and uptake sites are therapeutic targets for disorders ranging from depression to Parkinson's disease - in the human brain. The neurochemicals appear to integrate people's perceptions of the world with their actions, indicating dopamine and serotonin have far more expansive roles in the human nervous system than previously known.
