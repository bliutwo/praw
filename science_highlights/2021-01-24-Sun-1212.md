## Best of r/science 2020 Winners

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l0mle7/best_of_rscience_2020_winners/):

> U/InvictusJoker for 'A new study makes it clear: after universal masking was implemented at Mass General Brigham, the rate of COVID-19 infection among health care workers dropped significantly. U/ Shibboleth 's many answers during his COVID-19 community discussions [Link 1] [Link 2] [Link 3]. u/aClimateScientist explains their own research studying the accuracy of climate modeling [Link]. In your experience, what is the best way to pivot from having a large body of evidence to formulating effective public policy? Especially in the city where I live and work, Chicago, health inequity is a pervasive social problem.

## People buying SUVs are cancelling out climate gains from electric cars

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2265449-people-buying-suvs-are-cancelling-out-climate-gains-from-electric-cars/):

> The growing popularity of SUVs is making it even harder to cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate goals. The increase in SUVs in 2020 led to a rise in oil consumption that cancelled out the effect of electric cars, says Petropoulos. Peters thinks people rich enough to afford SUVs won't be deterred by slightly higher taxes.

`/u/jesterOC` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l44ui5/people_buying_suvs_are_cancelling_out_climate/):

> That's a weird way of saying electric cars are cancelling out the effects of people buying SUVs.

## Lack of sleep, stress can lead to symptoms resembling concussion. Between 11% and 27% of healthy college athletes with no history of a recent concussion reported symptoms that met criteria for post-concussion syndrome (PCS), predicted by lack of sleep, pre-existing mental health problems and stress.

`/u/seriousnotshirley` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l3klr0/lack_of_sleep_stress_can_lead_to_symptoms/):

> [Look at the diagnostic criteria for PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome#Diagnosis)S. It's not surprising that lack of sleep and stress could mimic this. In fact, I'd be surprised if it didn't. While important this study just confirms the seemingly obvious.

## Spanish study finds that while physical activity can mitigate the health risks associated with a high BMI, weight loss should remain a priority for improving public health.

Summary of [original article](https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaa151/6105192):

> A study conducted in 2196 participants reported that although PA was associated with a lower CVD risk within each BMI category during a 30-year follow-up, individuals with overweight or obesity presented with an increased CVD risk regardless of their PA levels. E. Association of "Weekend warrior" and other leisure time physical activity patterns with risks for all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. Physical activity and risk of cardiovascular disease by weight status among US adults.

`/u/JOSimpson` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l3zxtx/spanish_study_finds_that_while_physical_activity/):

> I think its common sense that overweight people should focus on losing weight for health reasons and yet some people would find this offensive in todays world

## For the first time, scientists have neurophysiological evidence that distinguishes different patterns of internal thought, allowing us to understand the varieties of thought central to human cognition and to compare between healthy and disordered thinking

Summary of [original article](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/01/18/where-do-our-minds-wander-brain-waves-can-point-the-way/):

> Where do they roam? New research led by UC Berkeley has come up with a way to track the flow of our internal thought processes and signal whether our minds are focused, fixated or wandering. Specifically, increased alpha brain waves were detected in the prefrontal cortex of more than two dozen study participants when their thoughts jumped from one topic to another, providing an electrophysiological signature for unconstrained, spontaneous thought. "The ability to detect our thought patterns through brain activity is an important step toward generating potential strategies for regulating how our thoughts unfold over time, a strategy useful for healthy and disordered minds alike," Kam said.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l44xdc/for_the_first_time_scientists_have/):

> Anyone who has tried and failed to meditate knows that our minds are rarely still. But where do they roam? New research led by UC Berkeley has come up with a way to track the flow of our internal thought processes and signal whether our minds are focused, fixated or wandering.
> 
> Using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brain activity while people performed mundane attention tasks, researchers identified brain signals that reveal when the mind is not focused on the task at hand or aimlessly wandering, especially after concentrating on an assignment.
> 
> Specifically, increased alpha brain waves were detected in the prefrontal cortex of more than two dozen study participants when their thoughts jumped from one topic to another, providing an electrophysiological signature for unconstrained, spontaneous thought. Alpha waves are slow brain rhythms whose frequency ranges from 9 to 14 cycles per second.

## The vast majority of the decline in economic activity during the COVID-19 recession was "due to individualsâ€™ voluntary decisions to disengage from commerce rather than government-imposed restrictions on activity."
