## Lack of sleep, stress can lead to symptoms resembling concussion. Between 11% and 27% of healthy college athletes with no history of a recent concussion reported symptoms that met criteria for post-concussion syndrome (PCS), predicted by lack of sleep, pre-existing mental health problems and stress.

## Critics say green policies stifle growth. The opposite may be true. Environmental regulation can in fact increase worker productivity and overall capital accumulation, according to new research, with green taxes having the largest potential effect on productivity.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/critics-say-green-policies-stifle-growth-the-opposite-may-be-true/):

> Their findings, published Jan. 12 in International Economics, confirm the Porter Hypothesis, an economic theory that predicts that environmental policy will lead to innovative growth and productivity, and counter previous theories that environmental policy is a burdensome cost to companies, the researchers noted. Green taxes, or taxes levied on businesses and individuals in order to promote environmentally friendly practices, had the largest impact on multifactor productivity, though De Santis and her colleagues wrote that green taxes need to be paired with complementary redistributive policies, such subsidies and grants for companies transitioning to environmentally friendly practices, in order to avoid damaging productivity. Other potential research avenues, De Santis added, include further study of how specific policies trigger productivity growth and the redistributive impact of new environmental policies implemented by the European Commission.

> >“So it is basically a win-win solution, because on the one side, firms improve their competitiveness,” De Santis said. “On the other side, it also adds to the environment.”
> 
> Green policy *is* good for the economy.  Some early assumptions in the literature explain why this is counter intuitive for some.  
> 
> Early economic literature assumed that any country reducing CO2 emissions would only incur local *costs*, because any *benefits* of preventing global warming would be diluted across the entire globe.  These early assumptions influenced other academic disciplines, and formed the framework for everything from international climate negotiations to the beliefs of the layperson ([Stern 2015, section 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/)).  Economic literature has since moved on*,* but the rest of us haven’t quite caught up yet.  Current evidence suggests that **the immediate local benefits of reducing fossil fuel combustion compensate or outweigh costs**, *regardless of what other countries do.*  
> 
> While early literature focused only on CO2 emissions, fossil fuel combustion generates other pollutants which impose immediate local costs.  Among these are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and others.  These pollutants contribute to four of the five [leading causes](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) of mortality in the United States[^(1)](https://www.lung.org/assets/documents/healthy-air/state-of-the-air/sota-2019-full.pdf)^(,) [^(2)](https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/pollution-facts/)^(,) [^(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564008)^(,) [^(4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881237)^(,) [^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26501300)^(,) [^(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870974). Considering these pollutants gives us a more complete picture of the societal cost of fossil fuels ([Shindell 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1343-0)).  Decreasing fossil fuel use reduces these other pollutants as well, generating significant additional social co-benefits ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031)).  
> 
> [Scovronick 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x#Abs1) finds that “The optimal climate policy (carbon pricing) has immediate and continual monetized global net benefits when accounting for health co-benefits. This overturns the findings from standard cost-benefit optimization models, which ignore health co-benefits and thus imply that optimal climate policy has net costs for much of this century.”  [Vandyck 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9) ([fig. 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06885-9/figures/6)) finds that the co-benefits of unilaterally reducing fossil fuel use exceed costs in most countries, even without accounting for benefits of avoiding climate damages.  Other recent research comes to similar conclusions ([Barron 2018](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2010007818400031), [Stern 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528513/), [Shindell 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0108-y))

When accounting for [health](https://nicholas.duke.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Shindell_Testimony_July2020_final.pdf) and climate benefits, reducing emissions on a 2**°**C pathway would result in a net benefit of nearly $1 trillion per year in the US.

## Largest sea on Saturn's mysterious moon Titan could be more than 1,000 feet deep ( 300 meters) deep — that's roughly the equivalent of the height of New York City's Chrysler Building. In fact, the lake is so deep that Cassini's radar couldn't probe all the way to the bottom.

Summary of [original article](https://www.space.com/saturn-moon-titan-sea-1000-feet-deep):

> Data from one of the spacecraft's last flybys of Titan, a large moon with the precursors of life's chemistry, reveals that a huge lake on the surface called Kraken Mare is more than 1,000 feet deep - that's roughly the equivalent of the height of New York City's Chrysler Building. Understanding the depth and composition of Kraken Mare will gradually reveal more about Titan's mysterious chemistry, dominated by ethane and methane that collects in pools, lakes and rivers on the surface, researchers said. Data on Kraken Mare was collected during Cassini's 104th flyby of Titan on Aug. 21, 2014, about three years before engineers deliberately threw the aging spacecraft into Saturn to avoid the small chance of accidentally contaminating the moon's surface.

## Effects of Coffee and Its Components on the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Brain–Gut Axis

`/u/microface` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l3l8dz/effects_of_coffee_and_its_components_on_the/):

> Coffee is one of the most popular beverages consumed worldwide. Roasted coffee is a complex mixture of thousands of bioactive compounds, and some of them have numerous potential health-promoting properties that have been extensively studied in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, with relatively much less attention given to other body systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract and its particular connection with the brain, known as the brain–gut axis. This narrative review provides an overview of the effect of coffee brew; its by-products; and its components on the gastrointestinal mucosa (mainly involved in permeability, secretion, and proliferation), the neural and non-neural components of the gut wall responsible for its motor function, and the brain–gut axis. Despite in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies having shown that coffee may exert multiple effects on the digestive tract, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects on the mucosa, and pro-motility effects on the external muscle layers, much is still surprisingly unknown. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action of certain health-promoting properties of coffee on the gastrointestinal tract and to transfer this knowledge to the industry to develop functional foods to improve the gastrointestinal and brain–gut axis health.

## The COVID-19 pandemic made U.S. college students’ mental health even worse

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-us-college-students-mental-health):

> The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has caused the mental health of U.S. college students to plummet, a new study shows. Students most at risk of mental health challenges stemming from the pandemic include women, Asians, students under age 25, those in poor health, those who knew somebody with COVID-19 and lower-income students, researchers report January 7 in PLOS ONE. Even before the emergence of the novel coronavirus, U.S. college students struggled with depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders at higher rates than the general population. To assess how the pandemic is impacting student mental health, Browning and colleagues surveyed more than 2,500 students from seven public universities across the United States last spring when the pandemic was ramping up.
