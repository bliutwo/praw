## Childhood neglect was associated with Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism, which in turn were related to greater levels of malevolent creativity as adults, who were more likely to think about ways to take revenge on others, fabricate lies to simplify a situation, and pull pranks.

## Vaccines Have Saved 37 Million Children's Lives Since 2000. Over the lifetime of those born between 2000 and 2030, the findings reveal 120 million deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 96 million will be saved by the measles vaccine and the hepatitis vaccine together.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-37-million-children-s-lives-in-lower-income-countries-since-2001):

> Putting a number on lives saved from vaccination is tricky and imperfect business, but that doesn't mean it's not worth calculating. Over the lifetime of those born between 2000 and 2030, the findings reveal 120 million deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 96 million will be saved by the measles vaccine and the hepatitis vaccine together. The results largely align with previous estimates, which found vaccines have saved the lives of nearly 20 million children in some of 73 of the world's poorest countries since 2001.

`/u/TBTabby` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l7k8yy/vaccines_have_saved_37_million_childrens_lives/):

> Anti-Vaxxers: what would convince you? Think before you answer "nothing;" refusing to be convinced of a claim no matter how much evidence is supporting it doesn't mean it's wrong. It means you don't care if it's right. And how can you consider yourself a searcher for the truth who's trying to protect your kids if you don't care whether or not vaccines will help or hurt them?

## Major depressive disorder is thought to be caused by a decrease in the number and flexibility of neural synapses. Researchers found that one psychedelic dose of psilocybin in pigs increased the number of synapses and made serotonin signaling more effective

> After I was diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 34, I did a high-dose guided psilocybin treatment and it was incredibly beneficial. I plan to do one per year moving forward as a bit of a “brain reset.”
> 
> Edit: Thank you for all the well wishes! I hope I can hang around for a few more years to see my kids grow up (currently 5 and 2). Lots of people are asking about my trip and how to do this themselves. Here's what I can tell you:
> 
> * Start asking around. Tell people you trust that you are interested in doing this. If you have any friends that use shrooms or other psychedelics, talk to them. 
> 
> * Contact some of the therapists on the [MAPS integration list](https://integration.maps.org/). Tell them what you're looking for and why.
> 
> * Once you find your guide, meet with them and talk about your intentions, and what coping tools you have if things get difficult. If you can find more than one guide, interview them and pick who you feel most comfortable with. 
> 
> * Do some research into how to use Psychedelics for healing. I read Micheal Pollan's excellent book [How To Change Your Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36613747-how-to-change-your-mind) and read the studies that were completed using psychedelics for [cancer patients at John Hopkins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/). [MAPS](www.maps.org) is a great resource and clearinghouse for this type of research. 
> 
> * I took a large dose because I am facing my own death, and 'ego death' was what I was after (and boy did I get it). But that might not be your goal, so probably starting at a smaller dose would be wise if you are trying to treat something like depression or PTSD. However, I hear that larger doses are really good for addiction issues.
> 
> * I did my trip at my guide's home. I was inside, and I brought headphones and an eye mask because I wanted to mimic the internal experience that the John Hopkins researchers used.
> 
> * My therapy and psychiatrist were fully on board. I met with them before and after to prepare myself and integrate the experience. Be aware that you don't want to do psychedelics while you are taking SSRIs or MAOIs (most anti-depressants) because it can lead to Serotonin Syndrome, which can be fatal. 
> 
> * I brought my journal, water and snacks. Once the trip really got going, I lay on the couch immobile for about five hours. When I could move again and started to come down, I was extremely exhausted and depleted in every way. I journaled about my experience and drank water and tried to eat something.
> 
> * I felt fine the day after. I was tired and still processing my experience, but I was physically fine. 
> 
> * I hope all of this is helpful!

## Researchers at Vanderbilt University have discovered how to effectively switch off a gene that drives the growth of cancer. The gene - Myc - has long been a target but was considered “undruggable” – so the team instead shut down a protein that it interacts with, shrinking tumors in a matter of days

> That’s a really cool discovery. It amazing some of the new ways that they’re coming up with to fight cancer. 
> 
> I guess that the next challenge is figuring out how to shut down that protein in a living organism, and finding out what side effects that causes.

## Precarious employment was on the rise long before COVID-19, and has increased 9% between 1988 and 2016. Precarious employment is defined as low-quality employment, characterized by low wages, job insecurity and irregular hours, making employment risky and stressful for the worker.

Summary of [original article](https://today.uic.edu/study-reveals-precarious-employment-on-the-rise-long-before-covid-19):

> Precarious employment, or P.E., is defined as low-quality employment, which is often characterized by low wages, job insecurity and irregular hours, making employment risky and stressful for the worker. In her study, "Changes in precarious employment in the United States: A longitudinal analysis," Vanessa Oddo, assistant professor in UIC's School of Applied Health Sciences, sought to create a multidimensional and continuous measure of P.E. in the U.S. She also set out to describe changes in precarious employment over time, both overall and within subgroups. Employment stability - employment continuity, contractual temporariness and/or organizational changes.

`/u/Everard5` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/l7rv0i/precarious_employment_was_on_the_rise_long_before/):

> I find this topic interesting because more and more "small businesses" have been entering conversations I'm having at work and the national dialogue, and I want to know what effect our espousing of the small business model is actually having on the average worker, and if it's actually hurting.
> 
> And whenever I think of "small businesses", I think "insecure jobs that aren't financially protected in any meaningful way, relying on an overworked but dedicated employer". As fulfilling and great they may be, I think of them as pretty precarious. We brag about how minorities, for example, are small business owners and how small businesses are important for the economy, but the instant the economy sneezes these populations get their wealth wiped and they get left behind. As people move beyond working for large corporations, they seem to have less access to labor protections gained from collective bargaining, as mentioned in this paper when they talk about unions.
> 
> I'd love to read more papers examining topics like this.

## Box seat: scientists solve the mystery of why wombats have cube-shaped poo | Animals

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/box-seat-scientists-solve-the-mystery-of-why-wombats-have-cube-shaped-poo):

> How wombats produce their cube-shape poo has long been a biological puzzle but now an international study has provided the answer to this unusual natural phenomenon. There was speculation that wombats had a square-shaped anal sphincter, that the faeces get squeezed between the pelvic bones, as well as the "Complete nonsense" idea that wombats pat the faeces into shape after they deposit them. Asked why wombats have this feature, Carver said one theory was that wombats, with their strong sense of smell, communicate with each other via faeces and that the cube shape helps prevent the faeces from rolling away.

## Methane emissions from coal mines are approximately 50 percent higher than previously estimated. The results have important implications for Earth’s climate because methane is about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to warming the planet over a long period.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/methane-emissions-coal-mines-are-higher-previously-thought#:~:text=The%20study%20estimates%20that%20if,about%20the%20same%20as%202020.):

> The study estimates that methane emissions from coal mines are approximately 50 percent higher than previously estimated. The higher estimate is due mainly to two factors: methane that continues to be emitted from thousands of abandoned mines and the higher methane content in coal seams that are ever deeper, according to chief author Nazar Kholod of PNNL. The results have important implications for Earth's climate because methane is about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to warming the planet over a long period. If efforts to address climate change remain similar to what they have been, the researchers estimate that methane emissions as a result of coal mining will increase dramatically by the end of the century: Nearly eight times what they are today from abandoned mines and four times what they are from working mines.

## 'Lives were put at risk:' Automakers often delay recalls of defective cars in order to avoid hurting their stock prices, potentially leading to needless deaths, according to a new first-of-its-kind study using 48 years of U.S. data.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/carmakers-may-put-stock-prices-above-safety-when-timing-recalls/):

> Automakers delay recalls of defective products in order to minimize damage to their stock prices, potentially putting customers in unnecessary danger, according to a new study based on 48 years of U.S. data. Automakers may delay recalls of defective products in order to minimize damage to their stock prices, putting customers in unnecessary danger, according to a new study based on 48 years of U.S. data. The researchers also showed that the first automaker in a cluster to issue a recall experiences significantly larger damage to its stock price than firms that issue recalls shortly thereafter, incentivizing automakers that are aware of problems to sit on the information until a competitor reveals a defect.
