> This kind of warning started popping up around 2009-2011 more and more frequently, and by 2012 we were mere days away from almost getting hit by one of these solar storms. I remember talking to my boss at a pizza shop about it, and he legit had no idea such a thing was a worry. We're now approaching the same high end of the sun cycle, so hopefully we are lucky again that we don't get hit.

> "Judge quality" is measured by the number of citations to their written opinions?  That is... A shockingly bad way to do it.  I'm not saying there is a particularly good way, but the method the researchers chose seems to be just a simple, quantitative metric rather than anything meaningful.
> 
> Edit:  Holy Christ, they also measured the amount of output by a judge in addition to their "quality," and guess how they did it?  Number of words written in opinions per year.
> 
> >The baseline measure of work output is the total number of words written by a judge in opinions during a year on the job, which is a measure of the total volume of opinion-writing work that a judge is responsible for in that year. As alternatives to assess robustness, we look at the number of sentences written and at the number of characters written.
> 
> They do at least give a nod to some of the problems with their approach:
> 
> >It is a quite limited measure of what judges do, which includes not just providing a high-quality precedent but also finding justice in a particular case. Citations might reflect dimensions of decisions other than quality, such as the topic or the partisan bias of the decision. Judges might try to influence their citations through other ways besides quality, such as social networking. We can only partly address these concerns, such as by looking at multiple measures, controlling for topics, and validating against other quality signals. In the empirical analysis, we are implicitly assuming that it is the quality factor of citations that is most systematically varying in response to how judges are selected.

## Ground-breaking bacteria-killing viruses unite with antibiotics to fight devastating antibiotic-resistant bacteria

> Phage therapy is fascinating. I've been following progress on this technology for a few years. Different companies and academic labs are trying different approaches: the first is trying to find a naturally occurring phage that can kill a bacteria you're interested in and the second is trying to de novo engineer a phage to alter its specificity. We still have plenty of work to be done in both areas, but the first is probably more promising at this point I think. The US Navy is trying to create a phage-bank with lots of well characterized phages that can be screened easily.
> 
> Phage therapy will absolutely be a powerful tool moving forward. The world obviously was shaken by COVID, but I had been thinking for a long time that we were overdue for a bacterial pandemic stemming from the emergence of an antibacterial resistant strain. And if that happens, we're going to be in a bad spot because antibiotic discovery is significantly harder than creating a vaccine. We also have a very poor pipeline of promising truly new traditional antibiotics- pharma companies don't want to invest in it because a 14 day prescription isn't profitable and the US science funding for basic science isn't great.
> 
> The biggest hope out there is that we already have compassionate care use examples of phage therapy. The most high profile one was of Tom Patterson, who was in a coma after contracting a nasty strain of Acinetobacter baumannii. In an insane stroke of luck, his wife was a public health professor who had heard of this therapy before. She got in contact with an MD, they were able to get an experimental phage cocktail from a San Diego startup, and got approval to treat him. The man made a full recovery. Really really fascinating stuff, phage therapy is the future of antibiotics.

## Research finds evidence of a cosmic airburst destroying a city in the Middle Bronze Age (about 3,600 years ago, roughly 1650 BCE) The settlement in its time had become the largest continuously occupied Bronze Age city in the southern Levant, having hosted early civilization for a few thousand years.

Summary of [original article](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2021/020400/ancient-disaster):

> In the Middle Bronze Age, the city of Tall el-Hammam was ascendant. Evidence for resettlement of Tall el-Hammam and nearby communities appears again in the Iron Age, roughly 600 years after the cities' sudden devastation in the Bronze Age. "All the observations stated in Genesis are consistent with a cosmic airburst," Kennett said, "But there's no scientific proof that this destroyed city is indeed the Sodom of the Old Testament." However, the researchers said, the disaster could have generated an oral tradition that may have served as the inspiration for the written account in the book of Genesis, as well as the biblical account of the burning of Jericho in the Old Testament Book of Joshua.

## Japanese Knotweed extract could cut cancer risk of processed meat - Scientists have developed processed red meat that includes added natural substitutes which reduces the carcinogenic compound nitrite added to preserve meats [using mixture including rosemary, green tea, extract of Japanese Knotweed]

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.202001214):

> O6-MeG adducts f) Significantly different between the groups; 2.0g) Significantly lower as compared to processed red meat group, and as compared to PHYTOME meat group reduced-nitrite; 2.6 1.4h) Significantly lower as compared to baseline, as compared to processed red meat group, as compared to PHYTOME meat standard-nitrite group, and as compared to PHYTOME meat group reduced-nitrite; 2.4 2.6 High ATNC N.A. 21.0i) Significantly higher as compared to white meat group combined with drinking water containing low nitrate levels, and PHYTOME meat group reduced-nitrite combined with drinking water containing high nitrate levels. In the present study, no statistically significant difference in the level of DNA strand breaks was found after PHYTOME meat consumption as compared to consumption of white meat or processed red meat, either with or without nitrite reduction, indicating no difference in genotoxic potential between PHYTOME meat products and conventional processed red meat products or white meat. Overall, the data from the human dietary intervention study support the rationale behind the PHYTOME concept, that is, that the introduction of natural bioactive compounds from plant extracts in combination with standard or reduced amounts of added nitrite in processed meat products, results in the reduced formation of NOCs and less adverse reactions in the human large intestine.

`/u/vkashen` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/psu41c/japanese_knotweed_extract_could_cut_cancer_risk/):

> If this is validated it's great for so many reasons. Knotweed is damn near impossible to get rid of in areas where it's an invasive species, so it would be nice to know that there is some utility to a plant that is the bane of many of our existences. I eat it as a forager, but in general, while it's taken over where I live, at least I've been able to keep it off my property. But this would be a really nice "But hey, I can help you even though you hate me" moment for Japanese Knotweed. :)

## Research suggests a diet rich in dairy fat may lower the risk of heart disease

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/22/research-suggests-a-diet-rich-in-dairy-fat-may-lower-the-risk-of-heart-disease):

> A higher consumption of dairy fat may be linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, according to new research that suggests choosing full-fat dairy options is no worse for heart health. Researchers assessed dairy fat intake in 4,150 Swedish 60-year-olds by measuring the blood concentration of certain fatty acids that are found in dairy foods. That broader analysis also linked higher dairy fat consumption to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

`/u/ooru` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/pst88e/research_suggests_a_diet_rich_in_dairy_fat_may/):

> >The researchers said using biomarkers as a proxy for dairy fat intake was more reliable than depending on individuals to accurately self-report their eating habits. But the biomarkers could not distinguish what types of dairy products were consumed and whether they had different effects.
> >
> >Cheese consumption, for example, has been previously linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while a large US study published in April has linked butter intake to a higher mortality risk.
> >
> >...One limitation of the Swedish study was that the participants’ blood biomarkers were only measured once, at the beginning of the research, reflecting their dietary fat intake at a specific point in time.
> >
> >“Usually, we expect diet to not change that much,” Trieu said, acknowledging that dairy consumption habits could have fluctuated during the study period.
> 
> So, inconclusive, really. It is an indication, and it joins other research that may indicate that dairy consumption could help protect against heart disease and stroke, but one measurement extrapolated over 16 years isn't really a good way to prove anything (which is what they did).
> 
> I look forward to more conclusive studies in the future, having a love for cheese, myself.
