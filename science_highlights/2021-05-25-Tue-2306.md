## New technique links lithium distribution in the brain to depression - "Epidemiological studies have previously found local communities with high natural levels of lithium in their water supply tend to report lower rates of suicide, dementia and violent crime."

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/science/depression-lithium-brain-concentration-measured-first-time/):

> A new technique is allowing researchers to measure endogenous lithium concentrations in the human brain for the very first time. To test the technique researchers compared lithium levels in post-mortem brain tissue between a suicidal subject and a pair of healthy controls, revealing differences that affirmed the link between lithium levels and mental health. Exactly how lithium works in the brain is still unknown, and one of the challenges researchers have faced is the inability to effectively measure the distribution of lithium in a human brain.

## Researchers here have discovered cells in the bone marrow of COVID-19 survivors that were still producing antibodies against the virus months after recovery, suggesting immunity may last far longer than once thought.

> ST. LOUIS - Researchers here have discovered cells in the bone marrow of COVID-19 survivors that were still producing antibodies against the virus months after recovery, suggesting immunity may last far longer than once thought. In a study released Monday in Nature, researchers show that among a group of 19 participants who previously had mild cases of COVID-19, 15 had antibody-producing cells in their bone marrow that target the virus that causes COVID-19. The bone marrow work stemmed out of an ongoing study at Washington University, where researchers were tracking antibody levels in the blood of 77 participants, most of whom had mild cases of COVID-19.

> Isn't this completely expected? We know as a humoral response is dying down some of the antibody secreting cells will become plasmiblasts and migrate to the bone marrow to secrete low levels of antibodies for long periods of time.
> 
> This is the same reason we can measure things like Measels and Rubella antibody titers to see if someone still maintains their immunity from past vaccinations. We don't have to try to assay the quiescent  memory B and T cell populations laying in wait for the virus to return (Which isn't even really possible since there's relatively few memory cells for a given microbe and they're not active until antigen is encountered again).
> 
> Keep in mind we have no idea how protected from reinfection these folks are long-term, how responsive to variants they will be, etc. This is a completely expected finding in a small study that needs to be validated, replicated, and explored further to create a model of what level of antibodies indicates what probability of protection upon exposure.

## Nearly 66,000 early deaths would be prevented each year if U.S. air pollutant concentrations of three major contributors — fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide — were reduced from the 70th to the 60th percentile, according to a recent study led by a Harvard University researcher.

## Researchers have engineered new antimicrobial surfaces that can significantly reduce the formation of bacteria on medical instruments, such as urinary catheters, and reduce the risk of patient infection while in hospital

> The article does not discuss the cost of adding this feature to catheters, the difficulty of the manufacturing with this feature, or how easily the treated catheters accumulate damage that would eliminate the benefits. 
> 
> I'm also curious if adding agents such as copper to the catheter plastic could increase resistance to bacteria but without damaging nearby healthy tissue.

## Researchers have discovered the mechanism brain tumors use to "paralyze" the immune system and simultaneously learned how to reactivate it to target the brain tumor, according to a new study published in the journal Nature

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00201-z):

> We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. To investigate the dynamics and underlying molecular mechanisms of this glioma genotype-dependent immunosuppressive phenotype of GAM, we made use of an experimental HGG mouse model, GL261 episomally overexpressing WT and mutant IDH. We conducted scRNA-seq of flow cytometry-purified CD45+ cells isolated from IDH-mutant and IDH-WT GL261 gliomas comprising microglia, monocytes, macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, mast cells, granulocytes and T and B cells at two time points during glioma progression: early after primary tumor establishment at day 7 and at a late-stage time point at d28 after tumor injection. In IDH-mutant gliomas, we define the molecular mechanism as causally related to dynamic, R-2-HG-dependent tryptophan degradation by myeloid cells via TDO2 and LAT1-CD98, resulting in the activation of the immunity master regulator AHR. Our study shows that R-2-HG not only profoundly shapes the glioma microenvironment but regulates targetable immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolism in myeloid cells.

> Immunosuppression in gliomas is a big contributor to tumor aggression and treatment resistance. Hopefully therapies targeting tryptophan metabolism alongside ICIs and/or CAR-T cell therapy can make a difference in the abysmal outcomes seen in glioblastoma patients.

## Parents abused as children may pass on emotional issues - People who were frequently mistreated as children may find it hard to identify their emotions and implement strategies to regulate them. This difficulty, in turn, can harm their kids’ emotional development.

Summary of [original article](https://news.uga.edu/parents-abused-as-children-may-pass-on-emotional-issues/):

> The study, published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, found that parents with a history of childhood abuse or neglect often had difficulty accepting negative emotions, controlling impulsive responses and using emotional regulation strategies, among other emotion regulation issues. At the same time, boys were specifically more vulnerable to emotional regulation difficulties when their parents also struggled with emotion regulation. In particular, parents who reported being unable to set aside negative emotions to pursue their goals-such as getting work done despite being in a bad mood-were more likely to have children who likewise found it difficult to regulate their emotions during stressful experiences.

`/u/TazmaniannDevil` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nl5lkv/parents_abused_as_children_may_pass_on_emotional/):

> This is not surprising, I’ve seen it first hand in myself and my parents. Question, before I have kids: Can therapy ever actually reverse the effects or repair them to the point of full functionality? Of course I understand the paradox of “it’s not *all* the therapy” but still, question stands.
