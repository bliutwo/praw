## A new class of drug successfully targets treatment-resistant prostate cancers and prolongs the life of patients. The treatment delivers beta radiation directly to tumour cells, is well tolerated by patients and keeps them alive for longer than standard care, found a phase 3 trial.

> Radiation oncologist here. This is an exciting development, and I hope to be able to deliver the drug in the next year, if they can get the reimbursement figured out for freestanding centers. 
> 
> Lutetium also works for mid-gut neuroendocrine cancers, but it can be toxic (nausea) and tough to deliver (6-8 hour infusions). The fusion of Lu to PSMA is brilliant, as we’ve known for a few years now that PSMA-based PET scans are very sensitive for detection of metastatic disease.

## U.S. saw surge in firearm purchases and violence during first months of COVID-19 pandemic. From March through July 2020, an estimated 4.3 million more background checks for firearm purchases occurred nationwide than would have ordinarily — an 85 percent increase.

Summary of [original article](https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/contenthub/us-saw-surge-in-firearm-purchases-and-violence-during-first-months-of-covid-19-pandemic/2021/07):

> Firearm purchases and firearm violence surged dramatically during the first five months of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study from the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program, published in Injury Epidemiology. "Early in the pandemic, there were news reports about an increase in firearm purchasing. Given what we know about the risks of firearm violence associated with firearm access in general, and firearm purchasing surges specifically, we expected to see a relationship between these two during the pandemic," said Julia Schleimer, lead author for the study and a research data analyst at VPRP. States with the most excess firearm purchases per 100,000 population. VPRP is home to the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center, which launched in 2017 with a $5 million appropriation from the state of California to conduct leading-edge research on firearm violence and its prevention.

> It says right in the report that an increase in lawful gun sales did NOT indicate an increase in violence. Even though the OP tried correlating the two in the headline. 
> 
> "“This was unexpected given prior studies. If we look at the country as a whole, we saw that purchasing and violence both went up on average. But when we looked state-by-state at the places in which firearm purchases increased the most, those weren’t the places where the violence increased the most,” Schleimer said."

## Fructose promotes a hunger-like state in the brain and increases impulsivity toward food reward, leading to overfeeding.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421002761):

> Central actions of dietary fructose advances obesity by promoting overfeeding. Dietary fructose orchestrates concerted action from multiple interdependent and reciprocally-connected brain systems that are important for the control of feeding behavior. These outcomes promote overfeeding and are exacerbated in obesity.

`/u/Ozwaldo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oi6p7x/fructose_promotes_a_hungerlike_state_in_the_brain/):

> Huh.  Kinda lines up with the US's obesity problem and obsession with High-fructose corn syrup

## New study shows how preschool children struggle when what an adult tells them conflicts with what they see themselves. Results showed children rarely explored to try to resolve the conflict, but those who did resisted the misleading claims by the adult.

## Study: Sex workers dedicate considerable time and effort in order to retain regulars via relational work, noting such customers offer greater economic stability and fewer risks. Street-based sex workers also navigate boundary setting and slippage as a part of retaining or rejecting regular clients.

## Southern Australian sharks and rays being ‘cornered’ by climate change. Southern Australian waters are changing faster than other parts of the country and it is also the most heavily fished by commercial firms.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/southern-australian-sharks-and-rays-being-cornered-by-climate-change-20210711-p588pe.html):

> Southern Australia's sharks and rays face mounting threats as warmer waters push more tropical species southwards and habitats change, exacerbating threats to critically endangered species. While tighter controls on commercial fishing since the early 2000s had arrested the decline of many shark, ray and chimaera species such as elephant fish, those gains could be eroded as more tropical species such as tiger and bull sharks extend their ranges southwards, the researchers said. "Global warming is literally going to push southern sharks and rays into a corner, because they can only go so far south and west," said Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist with the Australian Marine Conservation Society and a co-author of the paper.

## Hand-writing letters shown to be best technique for learning to read. Findings have implications for classrooms, where pencils and notebooks have taken a backseat in recent years to tablets and laptops, and teaching cursive handwriting is all but extinct.

`/u/chancegold` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ohm30m/handwriting_letters_shown_to_be_best_technique/):

> So.. what exactly does cursive have to do with this?
> 
> I can get behind hand-writing being beneficial to learning to read, just like learning to hammer a nail is beneficial to learning carpentry in a world of nail guns and screws. However, that shouldn't necessarily have anything to do with any specific type of handwriting.. including cursive.
> 
> Cursive is basically an "efficiency" skill. It's a skill to allow people that already know how to read and write to write *faster*. As such, it should still be reclassed as more.. elective.. and to a status more in line with art/design rather than continued to be taught generally as a critical skill. Typing is a much, much more important critical skill to be taught as it relates to efficiency. Now, and moving forward, once a person knows how to read and write (with handwriting as part of the curriculum, given the findings of the study), typing should be the defacto "efficient writing" technique that is then taught.
> 
> Sorry, cursive aficionados, cursive is art and design now. If basic (non-cursive) handwriting didn't exist, it would be the different, but it does. As an "increased efficiency" higher level skill, it falls short to typing in speed/efficiency, clarity, and importance in daily life. Trying to say that this article is proof that it needs to be in the core curriculum is like saying that it proves [stenography](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34603886) needs to be in the core curriculum.

## Tooth loss associated with increased cognitive impairment, dementia. Adults with more tooth loss had a 1.48 times higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and 1.28 times higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia, even after controlling for other factors.

Summary of [original article](https://nursing.nyu.edu/news/tooth-loss-associated-increased-cognitive-impairment-dementia):

> Tooth loss is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia-and with each tooth lost, the risk of cognitive decline grows, according to a new analysis led by researchers at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and published in JAMDA: The Journal of Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. Their findings confirmed this relationship: each additional missing tooth was associated with a 1.4 percent increased risk of cognitive impairment and 1.1 percent increased risk of being diagnosed with dementia. "This 'dose-response' relationship between the number of missing teeth and risk of diminished cognitive function substantially strengthens the evidence linking tooth loss to cognitive impairment, and provides some evidence that tooth loss may actually predict cognitive decline," said Xiang Qi, a doctoral candidate from NYU Meyers.

`/u/mrlazyboy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ohghts/tooth_loss_associated_with_increased_cognitive/):

> Now is losing teeth the cause of the dementia, or is dementia the cause of losing your teeth? Or is there something else that causes tooth loss, *and* dementia?
