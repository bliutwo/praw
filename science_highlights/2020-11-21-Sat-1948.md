## Study suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has altered Americans attitudes toward inequality and the poor

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/study-suggests-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-altered-americans-attitudes-toward-inequality-and-the-poor-58598):

> Based on their previous research, the authors of the new study had reason to believe that the pandemic might alter attitudes about the poor and inequality. "I think one of the important takeaways from the study is a small silver lining from the pandemic. Our paper showed that the pandemic has exacted some positive shifts in egalitarianism and beliefs about the poor. Throughout the pandemic, our data suggest that there has been some greater awareness in how uncontrollable events can exacerbate poverty. While the pandemic has worsened poverty and inequality, the small silver lining then is that it might also mobilize people who see this damage to help and make change where it counts," Wiwad told PsyPost. "With our modeling of the longitudinal data we were able to show that the pandemic likely caused shifts in both attributions for poverty and support for inequality and government intervention to alleviate poverty and inequality. However, we saw overall attitude change only on attributions for poverty but not support for inequality or government intervention," Wiwad explained.

## Daily physical touch from a romantic partner enhances well-being, particularly among those with attachment anxiety. Being on the receiving end of touch behaviors offered unique benefits compared to initiating touch.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/daily-physical-touch-from-a-romantic-partner-enhances-well-being-particularly-among-those-with-attachment-anxiety-58592):

> New research suggests that being on the receiving end of intimate touch from a partner improves relational well-being in ways that giving intimate touch may not. Study authors Cheryl L. Carmichael and team were motivated to investigate whether adult attachments styles would be associated with different touch preferences and different responses to touch from a romantic partner. As the researchers expected, being avoidantly attached was linked to providing less daily touch to a romantic partner.

## Testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks, even if the tests are less sensitive than gold-standard. This could lead to “personalized stay-at-home orders” without shutting down restaurants, bars, retail and schools.

## The governor of Kansas issued an executive order requiring wearing masks in public spaces, effective July 3, 2020, subject to county authority to opt out. After July 3, COVID-19 incidence decreased in 24 counties with mask mandates but continued to increase in 81 counties without mask mandates.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm):

> As of August 11, 24 of Kansas's 105 counties did not opt out of the state mandate§ or adopted their own mask mandate shortly before or after the state mandate was issued; 81 counties opted out of the state mandate, as permitted by state law, and did not adopt their own mask mandate. After the governor's executive order, COVID-19 incidence decreased among counties with a mask mandate but continued to increase among counties without a mask mandate. For this study, counties in Kansas that, as of August 11, 2020, did not opt out of the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate were considered to have a mask mandate in place; those that opted out of the state mandate and did not adopt their own mask mandate were considered to not have a mask mandate in place.

> I wonder what's more telling. The stat about lowering incident rates, or the fact that over 3 times the amount of counties that kept the mandate chose to opt out.

## Pay-to-stay—the practice of charging people to pay for their own jail or prison confinement—is being enforced unfairly by using criminal, civil and administrative law. People will have a better chance at re-entering society if we shrink size of the correctional system and abolish pay-to-stay fees.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/states-unfairly-burdening-incarcerated-people-pay-stay-fees):

> Rutgers researcher examines how states sue incarcerated people in civil court to recoup incarceration costs. Friedman says rationales justifying these fees routinely do not recognize them as a form of punishment and instead policymakers see pay-to-stay as financial reimbursement to the state by portraying incarcerated people as using up system resources. "We must ask ourselves - are these fees and civil lawsuits simply to make a point? Should we make people pay back the state both through incarceration and financial indebtedness, often in perpetuity?".

## Parasite discovery could assist mental health treatments. The parasite’s ability to reduce norepinephrine interrupts the control of immune system activation, enabling an overactive immune response which may alter the host’s cognitive states

>  New research into how a common parasite infection alters human behaviour could help development of treatments for schizophrenia and other neurological disorders.
> 
> Scientists at Leeds say behaviour changes in those infected with Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite which currently infects 2.5 billion people worldwide and causes the disease toxoplasmosis, could be linked to lowered amounts of norepinephrine, a chemical released in the brain as part of its response to stress. 
> 
> Norephinephrine also controls neuroinflammation, the activation of the brain’s immune system against infection. Norepinephrine and neuroinflammation are associated with neuropsychological disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
> 
> Although usually considered asymptomatic in humans, T. gondii infection can cause headache, confusion and seizures in others as well as an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia – and can be fatal to immunocompromised patients.
> 
> T. gondii can only sexually reproduce in cats. It forms cysts which are shed in the cat’s faeces. It makes its way into new hosts through ingestion of anything contaminated by these cysts, such as water, soil or vegetables; through blood transfusions, from unpasteurised goat’s milk; eating raw or undercooked meat, or from mother to foetus.
> 
> After a few weeks, the infection enters a dormant phase, when cysts form in the brain. They can remain there for many years, possibly for life. It is during this stage that infection decreases the regulator of the brain’s immune response norepinephrine.

## Study proves that the socioeconomic conditions in childhood are associated with the onset of mental disorders. Based on the study findings, 25.2% of children born into the lowest parental income quintile developed a clinically diagnosed mental disorder by the time they turned 37.

Summary of [original article](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/health-news/risk-of-developing-mental-disorders-later-in-life-potentially-higher-in-children-of-low-income-families):

> Researchers at the University of Helsinki, Aarhus University and the University of Manchester have investigated the link between the socio-economic position of parents and the risk of children developing mental disorders later in life. "From among the mental disorders studied, the only exception was eating disorders. In their case, low parental income was associated with a lower risk of developing an eating disorder," Hakulinen says. "We observed that a third of the children who lived in low-income families throughout their childhood were later diagnosed with a mental disorder. At the same time, 12% of the children who grew up in the top income quintile were later diagnosed with a mental disorder," Hakulinen says.

> I always thought we were homeless because my mother was unlucky. Nope! Turns out it was paranoid schizophrenia, but no one knew because the black community does a terrible job promoting mental health and stigmatizes diagnosing issues like this.
> 
> What's really terrifying is that 20% of the homeless walking the streets don't have a firm grasp on reality and we just drive past them.
