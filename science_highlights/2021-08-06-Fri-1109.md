## Men and women are happiest with their bodies after hitting 60. Attitudes towards beauty ideals are at the crux of our changing perception of how good we look during our lifetimes, according to the researchers.

Summary of [original article](https://i.stuff.co.nz/life-style/well-good/300376235/men-and-women-are-happiest-with-their-bodies-after-hitting-60):

> While women aged between 19 and 24 were prone to being unhappy with their bodies, they were much more content with how they looked when they reached 60, the research showed. Body function over appearance "These results are also consistent with theoretical work suggesting that women place less importance on evaluating the appearance of their bodies as they age, and that older adults may value body function over body appearance," the study said. Increase in body confidence was more dramatic among women as they aged, whereas men tended to have a more positive overall attitude towards their bodies which gradually improved in their latter years.

> I’m 63.  As a young man, I was strong, flexible, and endlessly energetic.  I was not, and am not, particularly concerned with appearance but even by that superficial standard I’m less satisfied with my body.  I am,however,  completely unconcerned about other people’s judgement — but that is a different thing entirely

## A study suggests that people adjusted their music listening habits as a way of coping with the COVID-19 crisis. Survey respondents reported that they increased their music listening during the initial lockdown and that they used music to help them cope with emotional challenges during the pandemic.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/08/new-study-suggests-people-turned-to-music-to-cope-with-psychological-and-emotional-challenges-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-61643):

> Israeli survey respondents reported that they increased their music listening during the initial lockdown and that they used music to help them cope with emotional challenges during the pandemic. "We know from research conducted in music psychology that people intuitively use music in different ways to regulate their emotional states, to cope with stress, and to feel connected to other people. My co-author and I thought it would be interesting to see whether individuals felt a change in their use of music in real-time, during and in response to the crisis." Respondents were questioned about changes in their music listening during the lockdown, including whether their music listening had increased and whether their emotional response to music had changed.

## China is Fast Outpacing U.S. STEM PhD Growth - Since the mid-2000s, China has consistently graduated more STEM PhDs than the United States, a key indicator of a country’s future competitiveness in STEM fields.

Summary of [original article](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china-is-fast-outpacing-u-s-stem-phd-growth/):

> This paper compares the STEM PhD pipelines of the United States and China. Our findings also suggest the quality of doctoral education in China has risen in recent years, and that much of China's current PhD growth comes from high-quality universities. While it is possible that the growing supply of STEM PhDs in China exceeds current labor market demand, the quality and quantity of a country's doctoral graduates is an important indicator of its future competitiveness, and China's capacity to produce skilled PhD-level STEM experts appears to be growing rapidly.

## Results from four related studies show misogynistic men (who are openly hostile to women) are more likely to behave like benevolent sexist men (men who think women are fragile and should be cherished) only if they believe they have high mate value and are appealing to women.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-new-home/202108/misogynists-believe-they-are-unattractive-women):

> What is your opinion of women who prioritize their careers over being housewives or raising children? Or women who work as construction workers, firefighters, pilots, or business leaders-as opposed to secretaries, beauticians, or flight attendants? If you rate high for hostile sexism, you might think such women are trying to take men's power away or to control men. We can define benevolent sexism as objectively sexist attitudes-like "Viewing women stereotypically and in restricted roles"-combined with subjectively positive intentions and behaviors. While individuals with low levels of hostile sexism often show similarly low levels of benevolent sexism, people high on hostile sexism show less and less benevolent sexism.

> I'd really love to know how accurate the self perception of a man's mating value is compared to how women actually value them.
> Is this possible to measure scientifically?

## Perfectly preserved cave lion cub found frozen in Siberia is 28,000 years old. Even its whiskers are intact.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/world/frozen-cave-lion-cubs-siberia-scn/index.html):

> Found frozen deep in the Siberian Arctic, the cave lion cub looks like she's asleep and one touch might awaken her. The Siberian Simba, nicknamed Sparta, was one of two baby cave lions - extinct big cats that used to roam widely across the northern hemisphere - found in 2017 and 2018 by mammoth tusk hunters on the banks of the Semyuelyakh River in Russia's Far East. The study, published in the journal Quaternary, found that the cave lions' coat was similar but not identical to that of an African lion cub.

`/u/hat-of-sky` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oyz13s/perfectly_preserved_cave_lion_cub_found_frozen_in/):

> "Some 28,000 years since she last closed her eyes, her claws are still sharp enough to prick the finger of one of the scientists who are studying this remarkable -- and unprecedented -- permafrost-preserved specimen."
> 
> Uh-oh. Somebody's getting Cave Lion Powers tonight.

## Why we should build for wildlife as well as people

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210727-how-to-boost-biodiversity-and-attract-wildlife-to-your-home):

> From green roofs to bee bricks and hedgehog drawers, there are plenty of ways to make sterile buildings more accommodating to nature. These visions of wildlife atop city buildings aren't just picturesque, they're often hailed as one solution to the world's rapid loss of nature. A 2007 study led by cultural botanist Erica Oberndorfer at Saint Mary's University, Halifax in Canada, noted that green roofs can provide habitats for various species, reduce heavy run-off of storm water from buildings and even help to cool interiors.

> >**Abstract:** The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a major ocean current system transporting warm surface waters toward the northern Atlantic, has been suggested to exhibit two distinct modes of operation. A collapse from the currently attained strong to the weak mode would have severe impacts on the global climate system and further multi-stable Earth system components. Observations and recently suggested fingerprints of AMOC variability indicate a gradual weakening during the last decades, but estimates of the critical transition point remain uncertain. Here, a robust and general early-warning indicator for forthcoming critical transitions is introduced. Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin. These results reveal spatially consistent empirical evidence that, in the course of the last century, the AMOC may have evolved from relatively stable conditions to a point close to a critical transition.
