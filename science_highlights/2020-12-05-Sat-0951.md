## Employees who take charge relatively more in their teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders. However, such employees are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

## Depressive symptoms induced by insurmountable job stress and sick leave for mental health reasons have become a focal concern. Researchers have now come up with the Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI), a measure designed to quantify the severity of work-attributed depressive symptoms.

> If this index holds up under scrutiny I’d like to see it adopted by regulatory agencies.

> The department I worked in at my former employer is going to 9 day weeks with just a 40¢/hr increase on weekends, that’s in addition to increasing the workload of their current workforce by arguably more than 2X while tying their evaluations (and therefor pay) to impossible metrics. I put on about 100lbs working there and didn’t start to lose it until I emotionally divorced myself from the position and devised an exit strategy. I’m currently unemployed and burning through my savings and I still feel less stress on a daily basis now that I’m gone even though my future has never been less certain in nearly 40 years. If the amount of damage to people that the working environment I came from can be objectively measured and companies be penalized for fostering those kinds of environments, this would be excellent news indeed. Even if such an index could be published as a warning to potential employees we’d be doing something.

> EDIT man does this amount of attention make me nervous. a few things; not naming the company because I still have friends and family there. I’ll just say that if a place has upwards of 500 locations there’s a serious chance they’re doing *some*thing heinous enough to make you queasy if you heard about it. Plus if you’re not in the Mid-Atlantic there’s a really good chance you don’t have to worry about this one anyway. And maybe stick to Mom and Pops for your gas and grocery just to be safe. Also thanks for the general support.

## A smile, which brings up the corners of the mouth and creates crow's feet around the eyes, can reduce the pain of a needle injection by up to 40%, and also blunt a stressful needle-related physiological response by lowering the heart rate

> A grimace had the same effect as a "genuine smile".  But a non-genuine smile did not.
> 
> The grimace may be more useful.  Getting patients to give a "genuine" rather than fake smile may be difficult when they're facing a needle ("No! I need your smile to have crow's feet!  Do you want this shot or not?!")  Getting them to grimace might be easier.
> 
> Of course that's not as feel-good as "smiles kill pain!"  But that's OK with me.  *Grimace*.

## blood type may play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Study finds slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types & the risk of death was increased for type AB & decreased for types A & B. Rh-negative blood type have a protective effect for infection, intubation & death outcomes.

## To decarbonize economy, researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "electrify" economic sectors with wind & solar energy. In some years, we will have to install more than a 100 GW of solar PV and wind power, and to achieve full decarbonization, CO2 prices will have to be a lot higher than today.

## Black Woman Becomes the First Doctor to Remove Cancer in Mice Using Nanoparticles

Summary of [original article](https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-woman-becomes-the-first-doctor-to-cure-cancer-in-mice-using-nanoparticles/):

> Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green has become the first person to successfully cure cancer in mice using laser-activated nanoparticles, according to Black Culture News. Unlike traditional cancer treatments, Green's revolutionary and unique nanoparticle technology, which was found to successfully cure cancer after testing on mice within 15 days, does not require chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Currently, Green's Ora Lee Smith Cancer Research Foundation, the nonprofit she founded in memory of her aunt, is continuing to fight cancer using laser-activated nanoparticles and focusing on its mission to make cancer treatment accessible, affordable, and effective.
