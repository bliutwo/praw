## Study: Teaching kids social responsibility—like how to settle fights and ask for help—can reduce school bullying. Students who said their teachers encouraged them to care about others and fostered a classroom environment with clear rules, also said they felt both less aggressive and less victimized.

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/teaching-kids-social-responsibility-like-how-to-settle-fights-and-ask-for-help-can-reduce-school-bullying-158493):

> No one knows how the social distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the children and teens who are growing up today, in Brazil or anywhere else. The techniques used by teachers in our study might help to cultivate positive connections and foster a resilient response to the pandemic - in Brazil, the U.S. and elsewhere - among children, families, schools and communities. As for how exactly social responsibility can help accelerate this recovery, more evidence-based research is needed.

> Also giving kids the vocabulary to be able to own up to mistakes and apologise without feeling they are losing face is an important early lesson for all young humans.

## Study: Men doing more family caregiving could lower their risk of suicide. The study tests that men's suicide mortality is related to men's private-life behaviors, specifically their low engagement in family care work - not just the adversities they may encounter in aspects of their public lives.

> Some interesting points to note:
> 
> > - Suicide rates are generally higher in men than in women, but not everywhere which suggests cultural influences.
> 
> > - Many theories have been proposed to explain male suicide, Canetto said. Most link men's suicide mortality to the stresses and the demands of their employment and their economic-provider roles.
> > - These theories typically predict that male suicide rates would be higher when their employment and economic-provider roles are under threat.
> 
> > - According to Canetto, men overinvest in economic-provider work, and underinvest in family care work--a pattern that leaves them vulnerable when economic-provider work is threatened or lost.
> 
> > - The researchers examined suicide, male family caregiving, and unemployment in 20 countries, including the United States, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Japan. Suicide rates were found to be lower in countries where men reported more family care work.
> 
> > - "Our study took a public health perspective. It examined population-level social and economic factors that may be driving population suicide patterns, across a range of countries," Canetto said. "Its findings point to new directions for suicide prevention."

## Political polarization in the US is greatly exacerbated by "false polarization," the misperception that the other side is even further away and dislikes one even more than it does. This is related to anger and inhibits compromise.

## The Earth has a pulse -- a 27.5-million-year cycle of geological activity: Analysis of 260 million years of major geological events finds recurring clusters 27.5 million years apart

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/nyu-teh061821.php):

> Using the latest age-dating data available, Rampino and his colleagues compiled updated records of major geological events over the last 260 million years and conducted new analyses. The team analyzed the ages of 89 well-dated major geological events of the last 260 million years. The most recent cluster of geological events was approximately 7 million years ago, suggesting that the next pulse of major geological activity is more than 20 million years in the future.

> >They found that these global geologic events are generally clustered at 10 different timepoints over the 260 million years, grouped in peaks or pulses of roughly 27.5 million years apart. The most recent cluster of geological events was approximately 7 million years ago, suggesting that the next pulse of major geological activity is more than 20 million years in the future.

## Study: In Alabama, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, defendants are punished more severely on average as the county share of the Black population increases from 0% until peaking around 30%. Past the peak share, sentencing steadily becomes more lenient as share of Black population increases to 100%

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/racial-divisions-criminal-justice-south):

> Part of the explanation lies in the racial composition of US counties, according to a paper in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. In Alabama, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, defendants are punished more severely on average as the county share of the Black population increases from 0 percent until peaking around 30 percent, according to the authors' estimates. Past the peak share, sentencing steadily becomes more lenient as the share of the Black population increases to 100 percent.

## The amount of heat the Earth traps has doubled in just 15 years. Approximately 90 percent of the excess energy from this imbalance ends up in the ocean. And warming ocean temperatures lead to acidification, impacting fish and other marine biodiversity.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o2l716/the_amount_of_heat_the_earth_traps_has_doubled_in/):

> The planet is trapping roughly double the amount of heat in the atmosphere than it did nearly 15 years ago, according to an alarming new analysis from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
> 
> Researchers say it's a "remarkable" amount of energy that is already having far-reaching consequences.
> "It's excess energy that's being taken up by the planet," said Norman Loeb, a NASA scientist and lead author of the study, "so it's going to mean further increases in temperatures and more melting of snow and sea ice, which will cause sea level rise — all things that society really cares about."
> The study, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that what's known as the Earth's energy imbalance — the difference between how much of the sun's energy the planet absorbs and how much energy is radiated back into space — approximately doubled from 2005 to 2019. The result was "striking," the research team wrote.

## Study Adds to Evidence That Most Cancer Cells Grown in a Dish Have Little in Common Genetically with Cancer Cells in People.

Summary of [original article](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/study-adds-to-evidence-that-most-cancer-cells-grown-in-a-dish-have-little-in-common-genetically-with-cancer-cells-in-people):

> The finding, they say, should help focus more resources on cancer research models such as genetically engineered mice and 3D balls of human tissue known as "Tumoroids" to better evaluate human cancer biology and treatments, and the genetic errors responsible for cancer growth and progress. The investigators say their work adds to evidence that cancer cell lines grown in the laboratory have less parity with their human source because of the complex differences between a human cell's natural environment and a laboratory growth environment. To evaluate how well any of these research models align with what may be happening in people, scientists often transplant lab-cultured cells or cells from tumoroids or xenografts into mice and see if the cells behave as they should - that is, grow and spread and retain the genetic hallmarks of cancer.

`/u/bad-at-handles` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o2whzx/study_adds_to_evidence_that_most_cancer_cells/):

> Listened to an interesting talk some time ago, discussing how many ideas we have left on cutting room floor because they DIDN'T work in cell lines. 
> 
> Essentially the thought was maybe this didn't work in lab grown cella, but COULD have worked in an animal / human model. Similarly, how many drugs and treatments have we abandoned because they failed in a mouse model, when they very well could have worked in humans?
