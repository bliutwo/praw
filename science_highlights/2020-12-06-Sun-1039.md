## Drinking alcohol blocks the release of norepinephrine, a chemical that promotes attention, when we want to focus on something, in the brain. This may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

> Home  Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention. In a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence. "When we want to focus on something, or when we stand up from a chair and become active, a brain stem nucleus releases a chemical called norepinephrine. Acute exposure to alcohol inhibits this signal in the brain," said senior author Martin Paukert, MD, assistant professor of cellular and integrative physiology at UT Health San Antonio.

## Promising material can store solar energy. Researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.

> As we move away from fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy to tackle climate change, the need for new ways to capture and store energy becomes increasingly important.
> 
> Lancaster University researchers studying a crystalline material have discovered it has properties that allow it to capture energy from the sun. The energy can be stored for several months at room temperature, and it can be released on demand in the form of heat.
> 
> With further development, these kinds of materials could offer exciting potential as a way of capturing solar energy during the summer months, and storing it for use in winter – where less solar energy is available.
> 
> This would prove invaluable for applications such as heating systems in off-grid systems or remote locations, or as an environmentally-friendly supplement to conventional heating in houses and offices. It could potentially also be produced as a thin coating and applied to the surface of buildings, or used on the windscreens of cars where the stored heat could be used to de-ice the glass in freezing winter mornings.
> 
> The material is based on a type of ‘metal-organic framework’ (MOF). These consist of a network of metal ions linked by carbon-based molecules to form 3-D structures. A key property of MOFs is that they are porous, meaning that they can form composite materials by hosting other small molecules within their structures.
> 
> The Lancaster research team set out to discover if a MOF composite, previously prepared by a separate research team at Kyoto University in Japan and known as ‘DMOF1’, can be used to store energy – something not previously researched.

## Affirmative-action policies in Chicago high schools were a mixed bag. High-achieving students from poorer neighborhoods admitted to Chicago’s elite high schools had lower grades and were less likely to attend a selective college. But these students also reported more positive high school experiences

## Employees who take charge relatively more in their teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders. However, such employees are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.
