## Researchers focused on mental health benefits associated with playing video games to address symptoms of depression & anxiety. They found video games show promise as inexpensive, readily accessible, internationally available, effective and stigma-free resources for mitigation of mental health issues

Summary of [original article](https://games.jmir.org/2021/2/e26575):

> Given the existing mental health care challenges, this paper examines recent research on the potential for commercial video games to ameliorate symptoms in the two most prevalent mental health disorders: depression and anxiety. New Perspective: The Case for Commercial Video GamesBenefits of Commercial Video GamesIn contrast to bespoke clinical video games being developed and customized to address clinical issues for a particular cohort or group, commercial video games are generally available video games primarily designed for entertainment and not therapeutic purposes. With mounting scientific evidence in support of the efficacy of commercial video games for improving mental health outcomes, commercial video games should be considered as a potential alternative for the improvement of various aspects of mental health globally.

## Young people with poor mental health took a turn for the better during the pandemic but those with good mental health saw a considerable decline, new research reveals.

> Not exactly a young person (I'm 33) but that would also be case for me. The lockdown time was one of the best times in many years for me. I got back to working from home (which I vastly prefer), didn't have to commute to work (I hate public transportation and completely wasting time for moving from one place to another), didn't have to be constantly exposed to people. My mental condition got a lot better, I had less worries and more time to focus on things that I like (I'm an introvert that never gets bored by just staying inside, with me, myself and I). 
> 
> Things are going back to "normal" now and I'm again getting more and more stressed and angry over the fact that soon I will have to go back to my "daily work routine", working in the office, using public transportation and spending time among people. In general, I feel what most people felt when lockdowns happened for the first time.

## Killer whales spend more time interacting with certain individuals in their pod, and tend to favour those of the same sex and similar age. Patterns of physical contact suggest that younger whales and females play a central social role in the group. The older the whale, the less central they became.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uoe-dfr061421.php):

> "Until now, research on killer whale social networks has relied on seeing the whales when they surface, and recording which whales are together," said lead author Dr Michael Weiss, of the University of Exeter. "However, because resident killer whales stay in the social groups into which they're born, how closely related whales are seemed to be the only thing that explained their social structure." Patterns of physical contact - one of the social interactions the study measured - suggest that younger whales and females play a central social role in the group.

> The females are violent towards adult males and bite them until they leave the group, hence why the males form their own same sex groups.

## At Just 16 Months Old, Toddlers Will Reward Someone For Acting Fairly— though they don’t yet punish unfair behaviour.

`/u/Dr_Noco` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o1w4xy/at_just_16_months_old_toddlers_will_reward/):

> As someone with a 21 month old toddler, I found this quite interesting. It amazes me sometimes how sweet my toddler can be. For instance, she'll make sure to try to share her food with everyone in the room or at the table; if she has a snack, she'll go up to everyone and offer them some. But at the same time, she also has the "mine" attitude towards other kids playing with her toys. If our friends son picks up her toy, she will immediately go over and try to take it for herself.
> 
> My 7 year-old neighbor said with regards to my toddler - "Toddlers are full of weird" - and I couldn't agree more.

## A single dose of one of the two-shot COVID-19 vaccines prevented an estimated 95% of new infections among healthcare workers two weeks after receiving the jab, a study published Wednesday by JAMA Network Open found.

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/06/16/coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-health-workers-study/2441623849411/?ur3=1):

> June 16 - A single dose of one of the two-shot COVID-19 vaccines prevented an estimated 95% of new infections among healthcare workers two weeks after receiving the jab, a study published Wednesday by JAMA Network Open found. The first dose of the Moderna vaccine was 78% effective at preventing new cases just one week after clinical staff were inoculated, the data showed. For this study, Charness and his colleagues assessed the effectiveness of one dose of the Moderna vaccine in more than 4,000 healthcare workers at the VA Boston Healthcare System during the winter spike of COVID-19 cases in the Boston area.

> As an intersting comparison, the smallpox vaccine that wiped out smallpox globally was around 95% effective.

## New study in JAMA shows mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines DO NOT affect sperm count

Summary of [original article](https://ja.ma/3q1SiXV):

> 2 Because reproductive toxicity was not evaluated in the clinical trials and SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with decreases in sperm parameters,3 we assessed sperm parameters before and after mRNA vaccine administration. Semen analyses were performed by trained andrologists per World Health Organization guidelines and included semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and total motile sperm count. In this study of sperm parameters before and after 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, there were no significant decreases in any sperm parameter among this small cohort of healthy men.
