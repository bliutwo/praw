## Grandiose narcissists often emerge as leaders, but they are no more qualified than non-narcissists, and have negative effects on the entities they lead. Their characteristics (grandiosity, self-confidence, entitlement, and willingness to exploit others) may make them more effective political actors.

## New portable, smartphone-based, ultrasensitive saliva COVID-19 test with a 15 minute sample-to-answer time using CRISPR that does not require lab equipment. Viral RNA levels read by CRISPR were similar in saliva compared to nasal swab samples measured by RT-PCR.

> These comments are trash. This study is not attempting to argue causality. It's showing a recurring correlation that needs to be investigated. They are right.
> 
> A small scale study has already been run, and the randomized group given vitamin D appeared to fare better. But I agree, more research is necessary.
> 
> But if it makes you feel like a scientist, you can leave your comments about how people with higher vitamin D levels are usually more active and healthier. You're not wrong, but you're also not saying anything the actual scientists don't know, and it's still a factor worth investigating, especially given the more occurrence of side effects with vitamin D supplementation.

> I'm a chemist, not a neural network scientist. Hence, a question from me, which I'd like to be discussed - is it an actual learning, or does the network just memorize the test cases?

## How individuals with dark personality traits react to COVID-19 - People high in narcissism and psychopathy were less likely to engage in cleaning behaviors. People with narcissism have a negative response to the pandemic as it restricts their ability to exploit others within the social system.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/general-psychiatry/how-individuals-with-dark-personality-traits-are-reacting-to-covid-19/):

> Dark personality traits predict individual responses to global crises, according to results of a study recently published in Personality and Individual Differences. Though studies have shown certain personality traits to predict behavior during the coronavirus-19 pandemic, the impact of dark personality traits on affect and cognition in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been determined. This information sheds light on how individuals with dark personality traits respond to times of uncertainty.

`/u/Nerodia_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kox0pz/how_individuals_with_dark_personality_traits/):

> More accurately, this article predicts how politicians in general and other powerful individuals, not just republicans, have acted during the pandemic
> 
> Edit: I did, in fact, read the article.  My post was more a response to other people commenting that only republicans exhibit dark traits.  I do agree the republicans are woefully corrupt.  However, if you think that only republicans are capable of bad things, you are disregarding facts, which is about as anti-science as it gets.  Science is the consideration of all facts to form a logical un-biased conclusion.

## Unexpectedly, Cholera Toxin has been used to enable the administration of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory drug that otherwise had limiting side effects. This novel fusion therapy avoids the toxicities of IL-10 and showed promise in animal studies for treating Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.

> This is super-cool.
> 
> People with IBD often were found to have dysfunctional IL-10 levels in their intestine, but systemic administration of IL-10 led to all sorts of problems.  So these researchers found a way to administer IL-10 orally *and still get it where it needs to go* (the lamina propia).   They used a fragment of the cholera exotoxin Chx to ferry the IL-10 across intestinal epithelial cells to the lamina propia.

> Cool, clever, and potentially quite useful.  Here's the paper from J Imm: [https://www.jimmunol.org/content/205/11/3191](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/205/11/3191)

> It depresses me that a post like this has no comments but the dumb r/science posts about pet surveys, pop psych bullshit, and pop poli sci bullshit get hundreds or thousands.

## Study: Discrimination is a risk factor for anxiety and related disorders rather than a result of common genetic liability alone. Reducing exposure to discrimination has the potential to improve mental health.
