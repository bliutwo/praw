## By age 3, kids prefer nature's fractal patterns, despite the fact that most are raised in manmade structures with Euclidean geometry, suggesting that this may be something innate, and may explain how viewing nature’s fractals reduces stress and refreshes mental fatigue.

Summary of [original article](https://around.uoregon.edu/content/study-finds-age-3-kids-prefer-natures-fractal-patterns):

> Before their third birthdays, children already have an adult-like preference for visual fractal patterns commonly seen in nature, report University of Oregon researchers. "Since people prefer a balance of simplicity and complexity, we were looking to confirm that people preferred low-to-moderate complexity in statistically repeating patterns, and that the presence of order in exact repeating patterns allowed for a tolerance of and preference for more complex patterns," she said. "We found that people prefer the most common natural pattern, the statistical fractal patterns of low-moderate complexity, and that this preference does not stem from or vary across decades of exposure to nature or to individual differences in how we process images," Robles said.

> Somehow, my Irish-American mother and grand-mother knew this...they told me to be sure and put the baby out in nature every day...lying so they could see the trees dancing and grasses, flowers, bushes moving in the wind.  Even in winter time, put them by the window so they could watch the patterns of the rain running down...

## Young adults who increased social media use were more likely to develop depression. Those using more than 300 min/day were 2.8 times as likely to become depressed within 6 months. Initial social media use led to increased depression, but initial depression did not lead to change in social media use.

Summary of [original article](https://news.uark.edu/articles/55480/increased-social-media-use-linked-to-developing-depression-research-finds):

> FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. - Young adults who increased their use of social media were significantly more likely to develop depression within six months, according to a new national study authored by Dr. Brian Primack, dean of the College of Education and Health Professions and professor of public health at the University of Arkansas. The study, which will be published online Dec. 10 and is scheduled for the February 2021 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is the first large, national study to show a link between social media use and depression over time. "We know from other large studies that depression and social media use tend to go together, but it's been hard to figure out which came first. This new study sheds light on these questions, because high initial social media use led to increased rates of depression. However, initial depression did not lead to any change in social media use."

## Contrary to popular belief, new research indicates that mismatches in sexual desire between partners are not associated with poorer relationship outcomes. Instead, couples with higher overall levels of desire tend to be more satisfied — even if there is a mismatch between partners.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/new-research-uncovers-what-really-matters-for-couples-relationship-and-sexual-satisfaction-58783):

> Contrary to popular belief, new research indicates that mismatches in sexual desire between partners are not associated with poorer relationship outcomes. In the study, 366 heterosexual couples individually completed assessments of sexual desire, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction. "Instead, we found that what really matters for couples' relationship and sexual satisfaction is partners having higher levels of sexual desire. This suggests that rather than trying to align partners' levels of sexual desire to be more similar, couples can build a more satisfying sexual relationship by focusing on strategies to manage these differences or finding ways to boost or reignite sexual desire in the relationship."

## People with beliefs in conspiracy theories have a cognitive bias known as the jumping to conclusion (JTC) bias, the tendency to perform hasty decisions based on little evidence, and a preference for an intuitive general thinking style, as opposed to analytical thinking.

Summary of [original article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.568942/full):

> Third, our aim was to further elucidate the interplay of the different thinking styles and CB. Most conspiracy theories are intuitively appealing and therefore individuals who exhibit a stronger preference for an intuitive thinking style could be more inclined to belief in said theories. As our study is to our knowledge the first to show an association between the preference for an intuitive thinking style and the JTC-bias, our findings should be regarded as preliminary and require careful pre-registered replication in different samples and with different measures of JTC.Furthermore, we set out to provide further evidence for the relevance and importance of a preference for a more intuitive thinking style regarding the formation of CB. In fact, results of the regression analysis indicate that a preference for intuitive thinking predicts the degree of CB, with a moderate effect size of R2 =.14. A preference for analytic thinking may not detract from or, in some cases, could actually benefit the maintenance of CB. Future studies could therefore scrutinize the role of possible moderators of the association of analytic thinking and CB.Another possible explanation concerns the measurement of both thinking styles: As the Rational Experiential Inventory and its German version used in the present study are both self-assessments, they could measure rather the self-perception of the participants than the actual thinking preferences the participants use more often in their daily life.

## Hard and fast emission cuts will slow warming sooner than expected. The risk of experiencing warming rates that are stronger than anything previously seen would be 13 times lower with rapid and deep emissions cuts, compared to an “average” future that continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Summary of [original article](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4734/hard_and_fast_emission_cuts_will_slow_warming_sooner_than_expected):

> The study, published in Nature Climate Change, used thousands of simulations from different climate models alongside multiple estimates of observed natural climate variability to investigate how various levels of emissions cuts could affect the speed of global warming over the next two decades. The findings show that reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, and in particular with its aim to pursue efforts to stabilise global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, has a substantial effect on warming rates over the next 20 years, even after natural variability is taken into account. Taking action now means we can prevent global warming from accelerating in the next few decades, as well as get closer to the goal of limiting warming in the longer term.

> So, how exactly will humans make the transition to not relying on fossil fuels?  I don’t see how this can happen on a large scale, at least, not in the next 20 years

## In the US, admission into selective high schools is as difficult to achieve as admission into top universities. However, a new study found that elite schools don’t help students academically any more than their less prestigious ones, including students from more disadvantaged neighborhoods.

## How Relationships With School-time Teachers Can Physically Impact a Person as an Adult

Summary of [original article](https://resetyoureveryday.com/how-your-relationship-with-your-teachers-can-physically-impact-you-as-an-adult/):

> Jinho Kim, assistant professor at Korea University and author of the paper, "The Quality of Social Relationships in Schools and Adult Health: Differential Effects of Student-Student Versus Student-Teacher Relationships" analyzed data of approximately 20,000 participants from the Adolescent to Adult Health study which is based in the U.S. This longitudinal study followed participants for 13 years, from grade 7 into early adulthood. As teens, the subjects were asked about their relationships with peers as well questions such as "How often have you had trouble getting along with your teachers?" and "How much do you agree that teachers care about you?" As adults, participants were questioned about their physical and mental health and examined for measures of physical health, such as blood pressure and body mass index. Schools should invest in training teachers on how to build warm and supportive relationships with their students, Kim said.

> As a child I was being raised in foster care and school was not a place I wanted to be. I struggled badly with academics. All through school I was blessed with teachers that truly cared for my well being and saw passed just my struggle with academics and difficult behavior. In sophomore year of high school when I was still in foster care my chemistry teacher brought me in a birthday cake. I don’t know how she knew that my birthday wouldn’t be celebrated at home but to this day it literally makes me cry to think about that simple gesture of kindness. The teachers I had that showed me kindness were absolutely pivotal parts of making me who I am today. Years later as an adult my 6th grade band teacher welcomed me into her family to share holidays with them one year and ended up adopting me. I didn’t find my forever family until I was an adult and those teachers guided me when I needed it the most. Without those kind adults in my life I would have become another statistic of a aged out foster child ending up in prison.
