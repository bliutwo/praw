## Testing half the population weekly with inexpensive, rapid COVID-19 tests would drive the virus toward elimination within weeks, even if the tests are less sensitive than gold-standard. This could lead to “personalized stay-at-home orders” without shutting down restaurants, bars, retail and schools.

## The governor of Kansas issued an executive order requiring wearing masks in public spaces, effective July 3, 2020, subject to county authority to opt out. After July 3, COVID-19 incidence decreased in 24 counties with mask mandates but continued to increase in 81 counties without mask mandates.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm):

> As of August 11, 24 of Kansas's 105 counties did not opt out of the state mandate§ or adopted their own mask mandate shortly before or after the state mandate was issued; 81 counties opted out of the state mandate, as permitted by state law, and did not adopt their own mask mandate. After the governor's executive order, COVID-19 incidence decreased among counties with a mask mandate but continued to increase among counties without a mask mandate. For this study, counties in Kansas that, as of August 11, 2020, did not opt out of the state mandate or adopted their own mask mandate were considered to have a mask mandate in place; those that opted out of the state mandate and did not adopt their own mask mandate were considered to not have a mask mandate in place.

> I wonder what's more telling. The stat about lowering incident rates, or the fact that over 3 times the amount of counties that kept the mandate chose to opt out.

## Pay-to-stay—the practice of charging people to pay for their own jail or prison confinement—is being enforced unfairly by using criminal, civil and administrative law. People will have a better chance at re-entering society if we shrink size of the correctional system and abolish pay-to-stay fees.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/states-unfairly-burdening-incarcerated-people-pay-stay-fees):

> Rutgers researcher examines how states sue incarcerated people in civil court to recoup incarceration costs. Friedman says rationales justifying these fees routinely do not recognize them as a form of punishment and instead policymakers see pay-to-stay as financial reimbursement to the state by portraying incarcerated people as using up system resources. "We must ask ourselves - are these fees and civil lawsuits simply to make a point? Should we make people pay back the state both through incarceration and financial indebtedness, often in perpetuity?".

## Study proves that the socioeconomic conditions in childhood are associated with the onset of mental disorders. Based on the study findings, 25.2% of children born into the lowest parental income quintile developed a clinically diagnosed mental disorder by the time they turned 37.

Summary of [original article](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/health-news/risk-of-developing-mental-disorders-later-in-life-potentially-higher-in-children-of-low-income-families):

> Researchers at the University of Helsinki, Aarhus University and the University of Manchester have investigated the link between the socio-economic position of parents and the risk of children developing mental disorders later in life. "From among the mental disorders studied, the only exception was eating disorders. In their case, low parental income was associated with a lower risk of developing an eating disorder," Hakulinen says. "We observed that a third of the children who lived in low-income families throughout their childhood were later diagnosed with a mental disorder. At the same time, 12% of the children who grew up in the top income quintile were later diagnosed with a mental disorder," Hakulinen says.

> I always thought we were homeless because my mother was unlucky. Nope! Turns out it was paranoid schizophrenia, but no one knew because the black community does a terrible job promoting mental health and stigmatizes diagnosing issues like this.
> 
> What's really terrifying is that 20% of the homeless walking the streets don't have a firm grasp on reality and we just drive past them.

## Excessive use of smartphones might be making us more impulsive & unable to delay gratification for bigger rewards. Immediate social feedback and access to information can make it difficult for people to refrain from using their phone, even when it’s inappropriate or dangerous, such as while driving.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ajc.com/life/study-smartphones-might-be-making-us-more-impulsive/RJNJI5D5IBCWTH74R4PHYGYIMQ/):

> "Our findings provide further evidence that smartphone use and impulsive decision-making go hand in hand," researchers Tim Schulz van Endert and Peter Mohr said in a statement. FDA approves video game for kids with ADHDLead author Schulz van Endert told CNN there are at least two factors underlying impulsive choice.
