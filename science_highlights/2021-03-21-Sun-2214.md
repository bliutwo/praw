## Trump's election, and decision to remove the US from the Paris Agreement, both paradoxically led to significantly lower share prices for oil and gas companies, according to new research. The counterintuitive result came despite Trump's pledges to embrace fossil fuels. (IRFA, 13 Mar 2021)

> Donald Trump's election and decision to remove the U.S. from the Paris Agreement both paradoxically led to significantly lower share prices for oil and gas companies, according to new research in a leading financial journal, while Joe Biden's presidency has so far been great for fossil fuel stocks. Integrated oil and gas companies saw 14.8% lower-than-expected returns around the election of Donald Trump in November 2016 and a 5.5% drop around his formal announcement in June 2017 that the U.S. would exit the Paris climate accord, according to a new paper published in the International Review of Financial Analysis. An oil and gas ETF would contain far more shares of diversified giants like Shell and BP than smaller companies - and the University of Gothenburg primarily reflected the performance of large companies.

> Probably cause demand for oil is decreasing and probably won't increase unless the president ordered everyone to burn a barrel of crude in their backyard everynight. Renewables are becoming competitive in a way that is cheaper and easier than fossil fuels.

## Study: If climate crisis continues unabated then northern hemisphere summers could cover nearly half of the year by 2100, making them more than twice as long as they were in the 1950s. Unlike their counterparts of 1950s, future summers will be more extreme, with heatwaves and wildfires more likely.

> Our summers are already about 20% longer than they used to be, and if the climate crisis continues unabated then northern hemisphere summers could cover nearly half of the year by 2100, making them more than twice as long as they were in the 1950s. Unlike their counterparts of the 1950s, future summers will be more extreme, with heatwaves and wildfires more likely. Using climate change models, they were able to show that even bigger changes are to come, with northern hemisphere summers lasting an average of 166 days by 2100, squeezing out all the other seasons and shrinking winter to just 31 days.

## Binge drinking in adolescence is associated with changes in the volume of the cerebellum in the brains of young adults, a new brain imaging study finds, even though they were highly functional and had normal cognitive capacity, and none of them met the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder.

> Binge drinking in adolescence is associated with changes in the volume of the cerebellum in young adulthood, a new study from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital shows. Earlier studies have shown that excessive, long-term alcohol consumption causes damage to the cerebellum in adults, but there is very little data on the effects of adolescent drinking on the cerebellum. Heavy drinking from adolescence to young adulthood is associated with an altered cerebellum.

> Abstract
> 
> Excessive alcohol use results in cerebellar damage in adults, but there has been less research on how alcohol use during adolescence affects the cerebellum. In this study, we observed that heavy drinking from adolescence to young adulthood was associated with altered volumes of cerebellar lobules. The study included two groups consisting of 33 heavy-drinking and 25 light-drinking participants. The heavy-drinking participants were highly functional young adults without alcohol use disorder, but with a history of regular heavy alcohol consumption. The participants were 13–18 years old at baseline and were followed for 10 years. At the age of 21–28 years, the participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From the MR images, the cerebellum was segmented into 12 lobules using the CERES pipeline. Heavy drinking did not influence the absolute cerebellar volume, but changes were observed in posterior cerebellar lobules associated with motor and cognitive functions. The absolute volume (p = 0.038) and gray matter volume (p = 0.034) of Crus II (hemispheres combined) were smaller in the heavy-drinking group. Furthermore, the relative volume of the right VIIIB lobule was larger in the HD group (p = 0.036). However, there were no differences in the absolute right VIIIB volumes (p = 0.198) between the groups. Our results suggest changes in the cerebellum in healthy young adults with a history of heavy drinking from adolescence. The exact implications and significance of these findings require further research.

## As whaling grew in the 18th and 18th centuries, sperm whales in the North Pacific very quickly learned—from each other—how to fend off the whalers’ harpoons, whose successful “strike” rate dropped by 58 percent in only a few years.

## By analyzing nationwide records of temperature and diarrhea incidence in Peru, researchers have determined that a temperature increase of just 1 degree Celsius is associated with a 3.8% higher rate of childhood clinic visits for diarrhea

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/when-temperature-increases-so-do-childhood-diarrhea-clinic-visits/):

> By analyzing nationwide records of temperature and diarrhea incidence in Peru, researchers have determined that a temperature increase of just 1 degree Celsius is associated with a 3.8% higher rate of childhood clinic visits for diarrhea, and that these increases are not mitigated by better water access. In 2016, Levy and her team conducted a comprehensive literature review of the effects of meteorological conditions on childhood diarrhea and other waterborne diseases, finding that there is abundant evidence that childhood diarrhea incidence is increased by rising temperatures. When looking at trends in temperature, they found that when temperature increased by 1 degree Celsius over the three weeks before reported diarrhea cases, clinic visits increased by 3.8%. They also found that moderate to severe El Niño events resulted in more clinic visits.

## Study Finds Glyphosate in More Than Half of All Sampled Florida Manatees

> ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.- A scientific study published this week concludes that Florida manatees are chronically exposed to glyphosate because of application of the pesticide to sugarcane and aquatic weeds. The study found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and the world's most-used pesticide, in the plasma of 55.8% of the Florida manatees sampled. "An increasing trend for glyphosate in manatee plasma that correlates with concurrent increased usage of glyphosate is disturbing, especially at a time when manatee mortality is at very high levels. The authors report the same level of glyphosate exposure that manatees experience, causes kidney and liver damage in laboratory animals."
