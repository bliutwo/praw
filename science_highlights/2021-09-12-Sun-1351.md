## The intelligence of corvids like ravens and crows is well known. Recently, crows were even shown to have a numerical ability seen in few other species so far: a grasp of the concept of the numerosity zero. Monkeys & honeybees also know how to treat zero as a numerosity.

Summary of [original article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/animals-can-count-and-use-zero-how-far-does-their-number-sense-go-20210809/):

> Why should animals have to recognize specific quantities at all? Why has evolution repeatedly made sure that animals can understand not just that four is less than five but that "Four squares" is in some way conceptually the same as "Four circles"? To Nieder, the presence of talents for numerical abstraction in animals indicates "That there is something already laid out in the brains of these animals that may constitute an evolutionary basis for what in us humans can develop into a full-blown understanding of the number zero." Impressive as the animals' accomplishments are, he emphasized that there are critical differences between how animals have been shown to conceptualize numerosity and how humans do it.

## The odor of anxiety-induced body sweat can make women become more risk adverse and less trusting of others, according to new research. The findings indicate that chemosensory anxiety signals can act contagiously but predominantly affect women

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/09/smelling-fear-study-provides-evidence-that-chemosensory-anxiety-signals-reduce-trust-and-risk-taking-in-women-61842):

> The researchers conducted a series of five studies with 159 non-smoking women and 55 non-smoking men to examine whether chemosensory anxiety signals reduced trust and risk behavior. The researchers found that women tended to transfer less money after being exposed to chemosensory anxiety signals compared to the other odors. The study, "It's trust or risk? Chemosensory anxiety signals affect bargaining in women", was authored by Lukas Meister and Bettina M. Pause.

## Study of 486 families finds essentially no influence of adoptive parents on adoptees' IQ in adulthood, providing further evidence for the predominance of genetic influences on adult intelligence over any other systematic source of variation.

## Sunlight can break down marine plastic into tens of thousands of chemical compounds. A study led by researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution finds sunlight isn't just capable of breaking plastics down; it can convert their base polymers and additives into a soup of new chemicals.

Summary of [original article](https://www.whoi.edu/press-room/news-release/sunlight-can-break-down-marine-plastic-into-tens-of-thousands-of-chemical-compounds-study-finds/):

> "It's astonishing to think that sunlight can break down plastic, which is essentially one compound that typically has some additives mixed in, into tens of thousands of compounds that dissolve in water," says co-author Collin Ward, assistant scientist in WHOI's Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department. The study examined the breakdown under sunlight of four different single-use consumer polyethylene plastic bags from three major retailers that make a lot of plastic bags-Target, CVS, and Walmart-and compared them to pure polyethylene film. An earlier paper by Ward, Reddy, and lead author Taylor Nelson, a postdoctoral investigator in WHOI's Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department, shows that biofilms growing on plastic in the ocean screen light from reaching the plastic surface and may slow plastic degradation by sunlight.

> I'm sorry for how this might sound: 
> As a child I had multiple outdoor toys out of various polymers and observed their changes over the summer. Yes, some got cracks and broke but the elastic ones also got sticky/slimy and that's when I learned that UV light alters the material. At university (mech. eng.) we were taught what happens there on the molecular scale.
> 
> Can someone tell me what's so new about this (or is it just how the article is written?) I mean I get that there has been little research as 'cradle to cradle' design is pure theory (in industry) and I'm glad someone is working on it.

## Weight loss via exercise is harder for obese people, research finds. Over the long term, exercising more led to a reduction in energy expended on basic metabolic functions by 28% (vs. 49%) of calories burned during exercise, for people with a normal (vs. high) BMI.

`/u/ferrel_hadley` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/pm3ylh/weight_loss_via_exercise_is_harder_for_obese/):

> >Overall, the analysis showed that in individuals with the highest BMI (body mass index), roughly half of the calories burned in activity translated to calories burned at the end of the day, while in those with normal BMI, about 72% of calories burned during activity were reflected in total daily energy expenditure.  
>   
> “There does seem to be … greater energy compensation in people with a higher BMI,” Halsey said, cautioning that it was unclear why.
> 
> This shows that if you have a high BMI, you will lose weight with exercise but the "efficacy" will reduce compared with lower BMI individuals. So you will either have to increase your energy expenditure or decrease your calories.  
>   
> But it will do little to change the over all strategy. Weight loss takes time, it only works when you make changes that will be lifetime patterns that can be maintained over years and decades.  
>   
> The standard advice from the major medical academies remains broadly the same and unchanged by this research: Build muscle, work on your stamina, aim for healthier food choices and all the rest are small fine tuning knobs.

## A new study by the ICTA-UAB establishes that the population density of hunter-gatherer groups was reduced where they depended heavily on meat to survive. The research reveals important links between growing season length, diet composition and population density.

> It seems pretty clear that dependence on one type of food is probably in relation to the scarcity of other types.
> 
> Relying more heavily on meat is likely due to scarcity if edible vegetation which, surprise surprise, probably makes meat more rare in certain conditions as well.
