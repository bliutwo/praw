## Those who flout COVID recommendations are less agreeable, have lower intellect, and tend to be more extroverted than those who adhere to recommendations. COVID non-conformists also prioritize self-interest and personal freedom and show greater tolerance for social deviance, a new study reports.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2021/07/30/what-psychology-says-about-covid-non-compliers.html):

> A new University of Sydney study assessed people's behaviours and attitudes towards pandemic regulations in Australia, the UK, the US, and Canada. Those individuals were mostly male, less agreeable, less intellectual as a personality trait, and more extroverted. Published in high-ranking journal PLOS ONE, the study also found that these people tended to prioritise freedom and their own self-interest.

> "Less intellectual" is not the way you should describe "less educated". When you look at the actual study data, its 10/23 countries have more males not complying than females (so near half) and the education level is varying between all it.

## Study finds COVID-19 patients put on ventilator on average suffer worse mental decline than an average stroke patient

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext):

> People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. 2021; 12.: 4111.]. Here, we analysed data from 81,337 individuals who completed the full extended questionnaire in order to test the hypothesis that those who had recovered from COVID-19 would show objective cognitive deficits when performing tests of attention, working memory, problem solving and emotional processing. These included as additional factors in the General Linear Model positive confirmation of COVID-19 infection through a biological test, people who reported residual COVID-19 symptoms, common pre-existing medical conditions that affect the respiratory system or immune system and that are associated with cognitive deficits, pre-existing psychiatric conditions, 12 items of the NHS Mood Self-assessment pertaining to frequencies of depression, anxiety insomnia, tiredness and problems concentrating, and months from symptom onset to cognitive assessment.

> I can only speculate on specific causes, but it has been documented that tiny blood clots (a form of DIC) can cause damage to the delicate brain tissue connected to those vessels that are clogged up by these micro thromboemboli and as such can lead to degeneration of that tissue which then causes mental decline.
> 
> That's the theory I am speculating on. There are other causes such as loss of oxygen perfusion levels needed to sustain proper brain function and therefore cognitive function.

## A study involving nearly half a million people in China reveals a clear link between cooking with wood or coal, and an increased risk of major eye diseases that can lead to blindness, according to a report published today in PLOS Medicine.

`/u/Ghostbuster_119` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ov457y/a_study_involving_nearly_half_a_million_people_in/):

> "The researchers from the University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH) and the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking University, Beijing, analysed data from almost half a million Chinese adults in the China Kadoorie Biobank. All the study participants were asked about their cooking habits by questionnaire, then tracked for hospital admissions of major eye diseases through linkage to health insurance records. Over the ten-year follow-up period, there were 4,877 cases of conjunctiva disorders, 13,408 cataracts, 1,583 disorders of the sclera, cornea, iris and ciliary body (DSCIC), and 1,534 cases of glaucoma among study participants.
> 
> Compared with those who cooked using clean fuels (electricity or gas), solid fuel users tended to be older, female, rural residents, less educated, agricultural workers and regular-smokers. After accounting for these factors properly, the results showed:
> 
> Long-term use of solid fuels for cooking was associated with 32%, 17%, and 35% higher risks of conjunctiva, cataracts, and DSCIC, respectively, compared with those who cooked using clean fuels;
> 
> There was little difference in risk between the different types of solid fuel used (for instance, coal versus wood);
> 
> There was no association between long-term use of solid fuels and an increased risk of glaucoma;
> 
> Individuals who switched from using solid to clean fuels for cooking had smaller elevated risks (over those who had always used clean fuels) compared to those who did not switch. People who switched had 21%, 5% and 21% higher risk for conjunctiva, cataracts, and DSCIC, respectively."

## New study reveals private groups behind the 'plandemic' disinformation campaign. By social engineering public attitudes and behavior, the campaign not only coordinated a surge in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, but also "coached" citizens into fanatic activism against COVID-19 measures.

Summary of [original article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.649930/full):

> We must remember that the aim of this research is to understand how planned disinformation affects social media network dynamics and public engagement with COVID-19 related science and technology. First, social network visualizations can show the direct impact of public interventions like Plandemic on the dissemination of disinformation. Do other social experiments like Plandemic incur similar changes in community structures, or do different network topologies correspond to different intervention strategies employed by disinformation campaigns? Is it possible, by investigating additional cases of social experiments which resemble that of Plandemic, to come to a classification of different types of network outcomes so that policy makers might respond to patterns of social organization in real time? We suggest that these are important questions to answer in future research endeavors.

## A toxic workplace triples your risk of depression, a new study finds. Companies that fail to reward or acknowledge their employees for hard work, impose unreasonable demands on workers, and do not give them autonomy are placing their staff at a much greater risk of depression.

> I've been fortunate to work in a non-toxic  manufacturing environment. We all are fairly friendly, we help each other out. We're paid a monthly incentive bonus based on overall shipments, scrap, customer complaints, etc. We have a cookout every once in a while. Stuff like that makes everyone feel valued for their services and time. My particular work area is next to a garage door, and outside of that door are trees. The mental health boost of seeing trees nearby is HUGE when you run similar parts on CNC machines all day.

## Google’s ‘time crystals’ could be the greatest scientific achievement of our lifetimes

Summary of [original article](https://thenextweb.com/news/google-may-have-achieved-breakthrough-time-crystals/amp):

> Time crystals are a wickedly difficult concept to understand and even harder to explain. What's amazing about time crystals is that when they cycle back and forth between two different configurations, they don't lose or use any energy. Time crystals can survive energy processes without falling victim to entropy.
