## Vaccination by inhalation: MIT researchers delivered vaccines directly to the lungs boosting immune responses to viral infections or lung cancer. Vaccinated mice were able to eliminate metastatic melanoma, and the vaccine helped to shrink existing lung tumors. (Science Immunology, 19 Mar 2021)

## Study shows how stronger female marital property rights can lead to lower levels of intimate partner violence. If women are financially protected outside of marriage, they in turn experience lower levels of violence inside marriage.

> Is it that they are free to leave an abuser, or do abusers tend to be attracted to people in a position they can control? Do abusive relationships spawn out of a situation where an abuser is earning more, and they begin to value their partners contribution less?  
> 
> 
> I think if you asked most abusers, they would say they love their significant other and couldn't handle it if they left. It's no surprise that they would try harder to control themselves if their partner had a way to survive without them.

## Greenhouses fitted with semi-transparent solar cells can generate electricity without affecting the growth and health of the plants inside, according to a new study, suggesting we could build energy-neutral greenhouses without harming crops.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/we-can-use-transparent-solar-cells-on-greenhouses-without-stunting-plant-growth):

> Greenhouses fitted with semi-transparent solar cells can generate electricity without affecting the growth and health of the plants inside, according to a new study, suggesting we could build energy-neutral greenhouses without harming crops. "It means the idea of integrating transparent solar cells into greenhouses can be done." The solar panels in this case are semi-transparent organic solar cells rather than the more traditional silicon-based type used in vast solar energy farms.

## The United States Geological Survey has determined that high mercury levels in the Great Lakes' ecosystem — enough to catalyze a chain of events leading to human consumption of the dangerous chemical — is largely due to remnants of pollution from old industries and other chemical-rich sources

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/hazardous-amounts-of-mercury-in-the-great-lakes-traced-to-past-contamination/):

> Her team's survey - the largest ever to use mercury fingerprinting - also enumerated where mercury is most concentrated in the freshwater ecosystem of the Great Lakes. Citing the many efforts to remedy the problem of mercury poisoning, Janssen hopes her team's study could potentially lead to other resource managers and organizations keeping mercury fingerprinting in their pocket as an effective method to detect mercury origination, too. The paper, "Examining historical mercury sources in the Saint Louis River estuary: How legacy contamination influences biological mercury levels in Great Lakes coastal regions," was published March 13 in Science of the Total Environment.

`/u/train4Half` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/mbanf7/the_united_states_geological_survey_has/):

> This study was only on mercury. There are other pollutants that are contaminating the lakes from industries that are still very much alive. For instance, the steel mills in IN dumped water contaminated with high levels of chromium into Lake Michigan in 2017. They got busted because Chicago draws the city's drinking water from the lake and they found the contamination. That same year, the same mill had another spill and tried to keep it quiet.

## Unpaid environmental damages from fossil fuels are a $600B annual subsidy

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/unpaid-environmental-damages-from-fossil-fuels-are-a-600b-annual-subsidy/):

> Burning fossil fuels exacts a number of costs on society as a whole, including a growing collection of costs associated with climate change. The results are substantial, with the externalized costs acting as a $62 billion subsidy each year in the US. In fact, Kotchen finds that much of the coal industry might go completely bust if it weren't for this subsidy. For 2018, most of the subsidy went to gasoline, at $200 billion, with diesel getting another $120 billion, giving petroleum products a combined subsidy of over $300 billion.

> Termed "externalities", and comprise one of the reasons why corporate shareholders fail to make a rational cost/benefit analysis.

## An experimental COVID-19 vaccine containing gold nanoparticles and coronavirus RNA successfully triggered an immune response in mice. Researchers say the vaccine, though in early development, could create complete immunity to COVID-19, unlike current vaccines

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/gold-based-covid-19-vaccine-prototype-shows-promise-in-mice/):

> An experimental COVID-19 vaccine containing gold nanoparticles and coronavirus RNA successfully triggered an immune response in mice, laying the groundwork for further testing and demonstrating the promise of nanotechnology in vaccine development. Many forms of nanovaccines are still under development, but some have already been commercialized, such as a hepatitis B vaccine in 1986 and a human papillomarivus vaccine in 2006, which made use of virus-like particles that have viral structures but are non-infectious. COVID-19 vaccines currently in use are unlikely to provide sterilizing immunity, the researchers said, but their vaccine candidate might open up new approaches to achieving it.

`/u/bostwickenator` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/mbeqhd/an_experimental_covid19_vaccine_containing_gold/):

> They mention bonding spike peptides to the gold nanoparticles. So are they bonding the protein or the RNA for the protein? I wasn't clear from the article.
