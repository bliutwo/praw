## Toxic workplaces increase risk of depression by 300%. The study has found that full time workers employed by organisations that fail to prioritise their employees' mental health have a threefold increased risk of being diagnosed with depression.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uosa-twi062221.php):

> A year-long Australian population study has found that full time workers employed by organisations that fail to prioritise their employees' mental health have a threefold increased risk of being diagnosed with depression. While working long hours is a risk factor for dying from cardiovascular disease or having a stroke, poor management practices pose a greater risk for depression, the researchers found. Internationally renowned expert on workplace mental health, ARC Laureate Professor Maureen Dollard, says the study found that while enthusiastic and committed workers are valued, working long hours can lead to depression.

## New research has discovered that common artificial sweeteners can cause previously healthy gut bacteria to become diseased and invade the gut wall, potentially leading to serious health issues.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/aru-ssp062321.php):

> Previous studies have shown that artificial sweeteners can change the number and type of bacteria in the gut, but this new molecular research, led by academics from Anglia Ruskin University, has demonstrated that sweeteners can also make the bacteria pathogenic. "Senior author of the paper Dr Havovi Chichger, Senior Lecturer in Biomedical Science at Anglia Ruskin University, said:"There is a lot of concern about the consumption of artificial sweeteners, with some studies showing that sweeteners can affect the layer of bacteria which support the gut, known as the gut microbiota. "Our study is the first to show that some of the sweeteners most commonly found in food and drink - saccharin, sucralose and aspartame - can make normal and 'healthy' gut bacteria become pathogenic. These pathogenic changes include greater formation of biofilms and increased adhesion and invasion of bacteria into human gut cells."

## More than half of young people with mild Covid-19 infections experienced Long Covid. Six months after the infection, more than 50 per cent of young adults aged 16-30 still had symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and trouble concentrating.

## ‘Dragon Man’ skull may help oust Neandertals as our closest ancient relative . The fossil may represent a new species in the human genus that lived more than 146,000 years ago.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=r_science):

> A fossil skull nicknamed "Dragon Man" has surfaced in China under mysterious circumstances, with big news for Neandertals. Dragon Man belonged to a previously unrecognized Stone Age species that replaces Neandertals as the closest known relatives of people today, researchers say. Ni's team concludes that H. longi was a contemporary of evolving Asian lines of H. sapiens, Neandertals and Denisovans, a population known mainly from ancient DNA. The Harbin skull most closely resembles several other Middle Pleistocene Homo fossils from Chinese sites, the researchers say.

> the thing about defining species from fossils is that if an archeologist found a fossilized chihuahua next to a fossilized St. Bernard, they'd be declared different species.

## US States that exhibit higher levels of systemic racism also have pronounced racial disparities regarding access to health care. The more racist a state was, the better access white people had – and the worse access Black people had. State-level inequities are symptoms of racism baked into laws.

Summary of [original article](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/study-highlights-racial-inequity-in-health-care-access-quality):

> In short, the more racist a state was, the better access white people had - and the worse access Black people had. "This study highlights the extent to which health care inequities are intertwined with other social inequities, such as employment and education," says Vanessa Volpe, PhD, corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA. "This helps explain why health inequities are so intractable. Tackling health care inequities will require us to address broader social systems that significantly benefit white people - and that makes them difficult to change." The recent study from Dr. Volpe and her collaborators looks at structural racism at the state level, people's individual experiences with racism, the extent to which those things affected the ability of Black people to access health care, and the quality of that health care. The researchers also examined the ability of white people to access health care and the quality of their health care.

## COVID-19 antibodies appear to wane rapidly. Research has found all vaccinated individuals, whether previously infected or not, will likely require booster shots moving forward because antibodies created through both vaccines and natural infection wane at the same relatively rapid rate

## Researchers discovered that the light-sensitive protein cryptochrome 4, found in birds' retinas, is sensitive to magnetic fields and could well be the long-sought magnetic sensor of the migratory birds.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03618-9):

> Millitesla magnetic field effects on the photocycle of an animal cryptochrome. Magnetic sensitivity mediated by the Arabidopsis blue-light receptor cryptochrome occurs during flavin reoxidation in the dark. Broadband cavity-enhanced detection of magnetic field effects in chemical models of a cryptochrome magnetoreceptor.

`/u/p53lifraumeni` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o6xd6e/researchers_discovered_that_the_lightsensitive/):

> Abstract: 
> 
> Night-migratory songbirds are remarkably proficient navigators. Flying alone and often over great distances, they use various directional cues including, crucially, a light-dependent magnetic compass. The mechanism of this compass has been suggested to rely on the quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the retinas of the birds. Here we show that the photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and pigeon (Columba livia). Site-specific mutations of ErCRY4 reveal the roles of four successive flavin–tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and in stabilizing potential signalling states in a way that could enable sensing and signalling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds.
