## Cleaner air has boosted U.S. corn and soybean yields according to new research from Stanford University. The analysis estimates pollution reductions between 1999 and 2019 contributed to a 20% increase in corn and soybean yield gains during that period, an amount worth about $5 billion per year.

Summary of [original article](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/01/clean-air-boosts-crop-yields/):

> Lobell and Burney extended their analysis back to 1990, when Congress passed Clean Air Act amendments that resulted in significant air quality improvements across the country. The researchers looked through air pollution data from hundreds of monitoring stations around the region, federal data on power plant emissions, satellite-based observations of nitrogen dioxide around those power plants, crop yield data from federal surveys and satellite imagery, as well as weather data to account for growing season conditions known to explain crop yield variations. The reduction in air pollution contributed to an estimated 4 percent growth in corn yields and 3 percent growth in soybean yields - increases that equal 19 percent of corn's overall yield gains during the timeframe and 23 percent of soybeans' overall yield gains.

> 20% is huge, that really surprised me.

## Some physicians maintain Fibromyalgia doesn't even exist, & many patients report feeling gaslit by the medical community. New research on mice has now found further evidence that fibromyalgia is not only real, but may involve an autoimmune response as a driver for the illness.

> For years this debate has been happening.  And this isn’t new science.  Almost every dr who treats autoimmune diseases(rheumatologist) will tell you there’s a relationship between the two!   I don’t see how after all this time there is anyone in the medical field who would deny the reality of fibromyalgia.

## The majority of biomass from beer-making hop plants ends up in landfills. New research from Yokohama National University in Japan demonstrates the feasibility of "upcycling" hop stems into cellulose nanofibers.

Summary of [original article](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsagscitech.1c00041):

> This work upcycles hop stems, which contain 44% cellulose, and demonstrates their suitability as raw materials for the isolation of cellulose nanofibers. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical-mediated oxidation fibrillated CNFs from pretreated and non-pretreated HS. A uniform height distribution was inferred from atomic force microscopy, with a median of ∼2 nm for pretreated and non-pretreated HS-derived CNFs. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction characterizations indicated that the pretreatment enhanced the purity and crystallinity of the CNFs, though traces of triacylglycerols and calcium oxalate monohydrate remained. The two CNF samples exhibited similar two-step thermal degradation at 255-260 and 300 °C, though less char residue was produced by the pretreated CNFs..

> Tbh, it's biomass, it could just simply be used as ground cover.

## Contrary to media reporting, lottery-based incentives do not increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. An analysis of vaccinations in Ohio before and after their "Vax-a-Million" lottery found no evidence the incentive was associated with increased rates of adult COVID-19 vaccinations.

> There's not a lot of people on the fence about this anymore.  They either trust that the science is sound and listen to the experts or they think the vaccine is worse than the virus because some politician or biased news report said so.  I don't think a financial reward system is going to do anything other than increase distrust, but it was worth a try I guess.  Not sure how else to reach the "covid isn't dangerous" crowd without big daddy Trump telling them that patriots get vaccinated.

## CO2 Rise in The Amazon Could Affect Rainfall More Than Deforestation. According to new simulations,a 50 % rise in global CO2 emissions has the power to reduce rainfall in the Amazon by a drastic amount,possibly equivalent to what would occur if the entire forest was cut down & replaced with pastures

## Downstream of hydroelectric dams and Alberta’s oil sands, one of the world’s largest freshwater deltas is drying out. New Stanford University research suggests long-term drying is making it harder for muskrats to recover from massive die-offs. It’s a sign of threats to come for many other species.

Summary of [original article](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/02/bellwether-drying-delta/):

> In recent decades the booms - and the area of the delta inhabited by muskrats during wet years - have been shrinking. The new estimates derive from a collaborative effort combining computer simulations of freshwater habitat in the delta and muskrat behaviors, along with genetic analysis of 288 muskrat tail tissue samples collected and donated by Indigenous trappers who captured the animals for fur and meat. According to the authors, no single portion of the delta is most important for muskrat persistence.

## Researchers Identify Brain Circuit for Spirituality. The brain circuit is centered in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a brainstem region that has been implicated in numerous functions, including fear conditioning, pain modulation, altruistic behaviors and unconditional love

Summary of [original article](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/research-briefs-detail?id=3935):

> Using datasets from neurosurgical patients and those with brain lesions, investigators mapped lesion locations associated with spiritual and religious belief to a specific human brain circuit. A new study led by investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital takes a new approach to mapping spirituality and religiosity and finds that spiritual acceptance can be localized to a specific brain circuit. To conduct their study, Ferguson and colleagues used a technique called lesion network mapping that allows investigators to map complex human behaviors to specific brain circuits based on the locations of brain lesions in patients.

`/u/shillyshally` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/octydx/researchers_identify_brain_circuit_for/):

> Spirituality has survival benefits for the individual (fends off life killing despair) and for the species (cooperation). That does not equate with the existence of anything beyond the material. Spirituality can still be purely the result of natural selection.
