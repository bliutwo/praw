## Dads engaged in their kid’s lives can help to improve their mental health and behavior - teens in low-income families whose fathers are more frequently engaged in reading, playing and providing necessities such as clothes and food during childhood have fewer behavioral and emotional problems.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/engaged-dads-can-reduce-adolescent-behavioral-problems-improve-well-being):

> In low-income families, fathers who are engaged in their children's lives can help to improve their mental health and behavior, according to a Rutgers University-New Brunswick study published in the journal Social Service Review. The researchers found that adolescents in low-income families whose fathers are more frequently engaged in feeding, reading, playing and other activities and who provide necessities such as clothes and food throughout their childhood have fewer behavioral and emotional problems - reducing a significant gap between poor families and those with higher socioeconomic status. "On average, children in lower socioeconomic status families tend to have more behavior problems and their fathers have lower levels of overall involvement than those in higher socioeconomic status families," said lead author Lenna Nepomnyaschy.

## LED lights found to kill coronavirus efficiently, quickly, and cheaply, a global first in fight against COVID-19. The finding suggests the UV-LEDs can be installed in air conditioning and water systems. It requires less than half a minute to destroy more than 99.9% of coronaviruses.

## A message from a physically attractive person can cause another person to change their opinion on an issue -- a bias for attractiveness cues. Though findings also show it can somewhat be counteracted by instructing people to be aware of this bias.

## By age 3, kids prefer nature's fractal patterns, despite the fact that most are raised in manmade structures with Euclidean geometry, suggesting that this may be something innate, and may explain how viewing nature’s fractals reduces stress and refreshes mental fatigue.

## USC study: Young adults who identify as Republicans eschew COVID safety precautions

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774123):

> Adults aged 18 to 25 years might be inclined to contravene physical distancing guidelines and participate in high-risk social recreational activities that increase the risk of transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.3 We estimated the associations of political party affiliation with physical distancing behaviors among young adults-a population with high rates of COVID-19.4. In this study of young adults, predominantly living in Los Angeles County or elsewhere in California, self-reported Republican political party affiliation was associated with less frequent physical distancing and participating in social recreational activities that may perpetuate the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations of the study include a focus on young adults in 1 county in 1 state, possible reporting biases, and the small proportions of Republicans relative to their national prevalence in young adults, which is about 23%.6 These limitations notwithstanding, our findings suggest that efforts to promote physical distancing among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the role of political affiliation.

## Study: Telling a distressed friend or family member something as simple as “I understand why you feel that way” can go long way toward helping loved ones feel better. There was no difference found in participants’ negative emotions – a result that speaks to value of focusing on protecting positivity

> Saying “I understand why you feel that way” and understanding why they feel that way can go a long way. The actual phrase though I doubt it does much. I’ve used the phrase many times myself and every time right after the other person would ask if I truly understood. I wouldn’t have said I understood if I didn’t.

## A smart ring that generates continuous temperature data may foreshadow COVID-19, even in cases when infection is not suspected. The device, which may be a better illness indicator than a thermometer, could lead to earlier isolation and testing, curbing the spread of infectious diseases

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/12/419271/wearable-sensor-may-signal-youre-developing-covid-19-even-if-your-symptoms-are):

> To conduct the study, the researchers used the Oura Ring, a wearable sensor made by the Finnish startup Oura, which pairs to a mobile app. The researchers provided the rings to nearly 3,400 health care workers across the U.S., and worked with Oura to invite existing users to participate in the study via the Oura app, resulting in enrollment of more than 65,000 participants worldwide in a now concluded prospective, observational study, which the UC researchers are preparing for publication. The researchers are using data from the larger, prospective study to develop an algorithm from data collected by wearable devices that can identify when it appears that the user is becoming sick.

## There are hidden orbits in the solar system that can extremely shorten the flight times of asteroids and space probes. These arc-shaped “super highways” are created by gravity resonances of the large planets and form a kind of high-speed network, as physical simulations reveal.

Summary of [original article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/48/eabd1313):

> AbstractSpace manifolds act as the boundaries of dynamical channels enabling fast transportation into the inner- and outermost reaches of the Solar System. INTRODUCTIONChaos in the Solar System is inextricably linked with the existence of stable and unstable manifolds, intricate structures whose mutual intersection plays a crucial role in chaotic transportation. DISCUSSIONThe manifolds reported herein act over orbital time scales of several decades, not the tens of thousands to millions of orbital revolutions traditionally considered in treating Solar System dynamics.
