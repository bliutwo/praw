## Legal cannabis stores linked to fewer opioid deaths in the United States. Findings may have implications for tackling opioid misuse. An increase from one to two dispensaries in a county was associated with an estimated 17% reduction in all opioid related mortality rates.

## The U.K. would have saved about 65,000 lives and had its GDP fall by just 0.5% rather than 11% in 2020 if it had adopted strict South Korean-style coronavirus controls, researchers have found, showing that there is not necessarily a tradeoff between the economy and public health

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/south-korean-style-covid-19-response-wouldve-saved-65000-lives-in-uk/):

> If the United Kingdom had adopted South Korean-style controls in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it would have saved about 65,000 lives through October 2020 and averted its worst economic decline in more than three centuries, according to a new study that modeled the countries' coronavirus policies. The researchers chose to compare South Korea to the U.K. rather than, say, the United States because the U.S.'s coronavirus response has varied significantly by state. "It's not like there's one policy for the U.S.," said Shin.South Korea's rapid and successful response to the coronavirus was partially due to past outbreaks in Asia such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as MERS, which the researchers said made governments more wary of disease and residents more willing to sacrifice privacy for safety.

## Masculine insecurity predicts endorsement of aggressive politics and support for Donald Trump, suggests three studies, supporting the notion that men who are likely to doubt their masculinity may support aggressive policies, politicians, and parties, possibly as a means of affirming their manhood.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/men-who-are-anxious-about-their-masculinity-are-more-likely-to-support-aggressive-politics-and-to-have-voted-for-trump-59417):

> The researchers propose that masculine insecurity can lead men to adopt aggressive politics - like those of Donald Trump - in attempt to reaffirm one's masculinity. The authors express that all three studies found evidence that precarious manhood is linked to support for political aggressiveness - as measured by support for aggressive policies, Donald Trump, and Republican U.S. House of Representatives. "Taken together, our findings support the notion that men who are likely to doubt their masculinity may support aggressive policies, politicians, and parties, possibly as a means of affirming their manhood," they say.

## CDC: Florida High School Wrestling Tournaments resulted in almost 80 COVID-19 cases and 1 death

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e4.htm):

> On December 7, 2020, local public health officials in Florida county A were notified of a person with an antigen-positive SARS-CoV-2 test* result who had attended two high school wrestling tournaments held in the county on December 4 and 5. The host school participated in the tournaments on both days; five high school teams from two counties participated the first day only; four additional high school teams from the three counties participated the second day. The incidence in county A placed the community in the highest category for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.†† CDC guidance provides community transmission level thresholds for school decision-makers that should be applied to school athletics and related social gatherings.

## Overfishing slashes shark, ray counts by 70%

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/overfishing-slashes-shark-ray-counts-by-70/):

> The number of sharks and rays roaming the world's open seas and oceans plummeted by 71% during the half-century ending in 2018, according to an unprecedented global analysis indicating that overfishing pushed three-quarters of the ecosystem-balancing species toward extinction. The study notes that two vulnerable species, the white shark and porbeagle, appear to be recovering in several regions, largely because of fishing bans on possessing or retaining them. In the U.S., advocates are hopeful President Joe Biden will "Return to its role as a global shark conservation leader" after America "Strayed from that posture and even opposed important shark conservation advances" in recent years, such as efforts to alleviate fishing pressure on the North Atlantic shortfin mako, said Sonja Fordham, a co-author of the study and president of The Ocean Foundation's Shark Advocates International in Washington, D.C.Next, Pacoureau said, researchers may shift their focus to emphasize the positive, analyzing what's working in oceanic shark and ray conservation and potentially producing a sort of practice-based report card.

## Each additional dollar of minimum wage reduces infant deaths by up to 1.8 percent annually in large U.S. cities. These findings support the increasing demand for the federal minimum wage to be raised from $7.25 to $15 per hour.

## In a new study of over 300,000 US veterans, researchers found that those exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those who weren't.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2774857):

> Question Is Agent Orange exposure associated with an increased risk of dementia diagnosis in US veterans of the Vietnam era? Objective To examine the association between Agent Orange exposure and incident dementia diagnosis in US veterans of the Vietnam era. A 2% random sample of US veterans of the Vietnam era who received inpatient or outpatient Veterans Health Administration care, excluding those with dementia at baseline, those without follow-up visits, and those with unclear Agent Orange exposure status.

## The number of sharks found in the open oceans has plunged by 71% over half a century, mainly due to over-fishing, according to a new study. Three-quarters of the species studied are now threated with extinction.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55830732):

> Scientists say sharks and rays are disappearing from the world's oceans at an "Alarming" rate. "Overfishing of oceanic sharks and rays jeopardises the health of entire ocean ecosystems as well as food security for some of the world's poorest countries," he said. The researchers compiled global data on sharks and rays found in the open oceans.
