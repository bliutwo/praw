## COVID-19 is not influenza: In-hospital mortality was 16,9% with COVID-19 and 5,8% with influenza. Mortality was ten-times higher in children aged 11–17 years with COVID-19 than in patients in the same age group with influenza.

## Water fluoridation improves dental health, has no impact on cognitive ability, and improves labor incomes. The impact on labor incomes is foremost driven by individuals from a lower socioeconomic background.

Summary of [original article](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711915):

> We have applied the following mapping protocol: if there is a single water treatment plant within the SAMS border, we assign the fluoride level of that water treatment plant to the entire SAMS. If there are more than one water treatment plant, we take the average fluoride level. Our findings add to the literature on the effects of fluoride on cognitive ability, but we have also broadened the understanding of the effects of fluoride by studying dental health and income. On the basis of the results, fluoride exposure through drinking water seems to be a good mean of improving dental health without negative effects on cognitive development for the fluoride levels considered in this study.

## Conservatives are more likely to see empirical (e.g., scientific) and experiential (e.g., anecdotal) perspectives as more equal in legitimacy. Liberals think empirical evidence is better at approximating reality, conservatives are more likely to say that both research and anecdotes are legitimate.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/conservatives-see-scientific-and-nonscientific-viewpoints-as-closer-in-legitimacy-study-finds-59122):

> Political conservatives in the United States see scientific evidence and personal experience as closer in legitimacy than liberals, according to new research published in the journal Political Psychology. "But there's always been a competing view that maybe both liberals and conservatives are just making the most convenient arguments for them - e.g., conservatives don't like climate science not because they're anti-science per se, but because they don't like the implications of climate science in general." "Liberals think empirical evidence is better at approximating reality, conservatives are more likely to say that both research and anecdotes are legitimate. The trends are on average - it doesn't mean there are no anti-science liberals or pro-science conservatives. And it doesn't mean conservatives are biased and liberals aren't - surely everyone is biased towards wanting their most convenient version of the world to be true, what we're showing is ideological differences in how truth is approximated."

> >Two studies examined how political ideology relates to attitudes towards opposing scientific and nonscientific perspectives on apolitical topics. Participants read an article excerpt containing quotes from a researcher debunking a common misconception, such as the existence of lucky streaks in games of chance. They also read the perspective of someone who rejected the researcher in favor of personal experience, either in the form of a quote in the article from a relevant professional (e.g., a casino manager, Study 1) or a comment from a purported previous respondent with no clear expertise (Study 2). In both studies, conservatives, compared to liberals, evaluated the views of the scientist and the person rejecting the science as closer in legitimacy. Differences in evaluation of the science rejecter were mediated by conservatives' heightened intuitive thinking. By spotlighting how partisans evaluate nonscientific perspectives alongside science and by focusing on apolitical topics, these results bring new clarity to the debate on whether conservatives are more biased than liberals in attitudes towards science.

## Bringing piped water closer to remote households in Zambia dramatically improved lives of women and girls, while also improving economic opportunities, food security and well-being for entire households. Governments & NGOs could carefully evaluate costs and benefits of piped water as an alternative.

## Psilocybin the psychedelic substance — which is found in “magic” mushrooms — might produce lasting changes to the expression of a few immune-related genes in the brain

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/psilocybin-produces-an-immunology-related-genetic-response-in-the-prefrontal-cortex-of-pig-brains-59115):

> An analysis of prefrontal cortex tissue revealed that 19 genes were differentially expressed one day after psilocybin administration. Immune-related genes constituted the largest group of genes impacted one week after psilocybin administration, suggesting that the long-lasting effects of the psychedelic substance might be related to neuroinflammation. The study, "Effects of a single dose of psilocybin on behaviour, brain 5-HT 2A receptor occupancy and gene expression in the pig", was authored by Lene Lundgaard Donovan, Jens Vilstrup Johansen, Nídia Fernandez Ros, Elham Jaberi, Kristian Linnet, Sys Stybe Johansen, Brice Ozenne, Shohreh Issazadeh-Navikas, Hanne Demant Hansen, and Gitte Moos Knudsen.

> Psilocybin is so hot right now. Either that or I'm in some sort of psilocybin news positive feedback loop. I'm excited though, hopefully this will mean decriminalization in the near future.

## Parasite found in cat poop linked to higher brain cancer risk in humans

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.33443):

> Previous epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between glioma and increased prevalence of T gondii infection, but prospective studies are lacking. We examined the association between prediagnostic T gondii antibodies and risk of glioma in two prospective cohorts using a nested case‐control study design. Our findings provide the first prospective evidence of an association between T gondii infection and risk of glioma.

`/u/eyoxa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kx5p1h/parasite_found_in_cat_poop_linked_to_higher_brain/):

> Aye.... most human infections by this parasite have NOTHING to do with cats. From [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html), this is how most people get toxoplasmosis...
> 
> -Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison) or shellfish (for example, oysters, clams or mussels).
> 
> -Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat or shellfish after handling them and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin).
> 
> -Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards and other foods that have had contact with raw, contaminated meat or shellfish.
> 
> -Drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma gondii.
> 
> -Accidentally swallowing the parasite through contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. 
> 
> *******
> 
> 
> This parasite is also commonly found in soil which is why pregnant women are encouraged not to garden! It can even be found on organic, home-grown fruits and vegetables!
> 
> I’m pregnant and had myself tested to see if I had/have this parasite myself. I discovered that I don’t have immunity. This surprised me, because I’ve been around cats most of my life (including fostering street cats and kittens in my bedroom who most likely had this parasite). And yet I’ve never gotten it... Why? Because it’s actually quite difficult to get from a cat. A cat must be newly infected to shed the parasite. An indoor cat living an indoor life and eating canned food is very unlikely to shed the parasite.

## Lego sets are good investments, providing annual returns comparable to those of fine art, wine and stamps, according to a new study using data from 95 countries

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/lego-investment-returns-match-art-wine-economists/):

> Average annual returns for Lego sets are comparable to those of fine art, wine and stamps, according to a group of U.K. researchers, potentially making the multigenerational construction toys a relatively safe alternative asset class for investors. The main thing he looks for in his research, Shanaev said, is matching well-established patterns from traditional asset classes such as stocks to alternative investment classes such as cryptocurrency and Lego sets. Lego releases each set for a limited time, and rather than refurbishing old sets, the company releases new designs of popular products, meaning that a Lego Hogwarts Castle from the early 2000s is a different product than the similarly named set being sold now.

`/u/Tonybastardisgod` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kxaql6/lego_sets_are_good_investments_providing_annual/):

> Keep them in box, and wait for them to be discontinued by Lego, then Profit. Especially if it has unique mini figures or unique pieces that have never been released elsewhere.
