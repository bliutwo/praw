## Declining social trust, a decades-long trend threatening America’s civic fabric, has been driven largely by individuals’ decreasing confidence in political institutions and experiences of job loss, new research found, suggesting the drop-off isn’t purely the result of generational shifts.

> It’s such an understandable situation. People want structure and safety. Lack of that is creating turmoil. What’s so disturbing, beyond the callous behavior that has gotten us to this point, is how such a large group of us feel inclined to punch in entirely the wrong direction to get us out.

## Neonicotinoids threatens future for key pollinator, finds first-ever study of pesticide impacts on ground-nesting bees. Female hoary squash bees exposed dug 85% fewer nests, collected less pollen from crop flowers and produced 89% fewer offspring than unexposed bees.

> Honestly, once the pollinators go, crops are done and so are humans. Not sure what the discussion is, we need to do away with these types of pesticides. Similar to DDT, they have such unintended consequences!

## Study: Sickness absence resulting from conflicts between managers and employees is higher than that resulting from other types of workplace conflicts. Improving managers’ leadership and human resource management skills should be a priority in developing and maintaining a health-promoting workplace.

## A single daily dose reversible non-hormonal male contraceptive agent has been successfully tested in mice and non-human primates, a natural compound purified from a Chinese herb. There are no non-hormonal male contraceptives currently on the market despite decades of development of “male pills”.

## New compound is first to improve health of diseased upper motor neurons that degenerate in ALS

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.336):

> NU‐9 improves the structural integrity of mitochondria and ER, reduces levels of mSOD1, stabilizes degenerating UMN apical dendrites, improves motor behavior measured by the hanging wire test, and eliminates ongoing degeneration of UMNs that become diseased both because of mSOD1 toxicity and TDP‐43 pathology, two distinct and important overarching causes of motor neuron degeneration. Since NU‐9 improved ultrastructural integrity of both mitochondria and ER of UMN diseased due to mSOD1 toxicity, and these were indeed the prominent defects detected in the UMNs with TDP‐43 pathology, we reasoned that a mechanism‐based treatment strategy would suggest NU‐9 to improve the mitochondrial and ER defects observed in UMNs that become diseased by TDP‐43 pathology as well, even though these are two distinct and different disease models. To visualize diseased UMNs and to assess their cellular response to compound treatment, TDP‐43A315T mice58 were crossed with UCHL1‐eGFP mice57 to generate an UMN reporter disease model prpTDP‐43A315T‐UeGFP mice.34 There is no misfolded SOD1 detected in the UMN of prpTDP‐43A315T‐UeGFP mice, and there is no TDP‐43 pathology reported in SOD1 mouse models or patients with SOD1 mutations,46-51 in fact mSOD1 toxicity and TDP‐43 pathology are accepted to be distinct causes of motor neuron degeneration.

## Face masks likely played a role in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy during the first half of 2020, according to a new study. The findings lend further support to the importance of face mask use in addition to lockdowns and other public health measures for the control of COVID-19.

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.taylorandfrancisgroup.com/face-masks-helped-to-reduce-viral-transmission-during-the-first-wave-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-italy-study-suggests/):

> Face masks likely played a role in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy during the first half of 2020, according to a new study by mathematical modellers, who show that the use of face coverings could have reduced the number of official COVID-19 cases in Italy by up to 30,000 during Spring 2020. "Surprisingly, we identified further drops in viral transmission in mid-April 2020 within certain regions, which corresponded well with the provision of free face masks and/or their mandatory use. We did not see this reduction in places that did not introduce any additional local interventions at that time." "Five of the eight regions showed further change points during April 2020 that corresponded well with the introduction of additional general containment measures, mandatory face mask use and/or distribution of free face masks."

> “We ran a mathematical model against Italian data and saw that some dates we identified as significant in changes of infection trajectory were in the ballpark of some dates of mask mandates and other interventions; therefore, masks caused any decreases.”

## People who believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories tend to struggle with scientific reasoning, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/02/people-who-believe-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-tend-to-struggle-with-scientific-reasoning-study-finds-59801):

> Individuals with a better grasp of scientific reasoning are less likely to fall prey to false conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new research published in the Journal of Health Psychology. The researchers found that those who strongly endorsed the coronavirus conspiracy beliefs tended to score low on the test of scientific reasoning. "The most important finding is that although scientific reasoning helps people to distinguish between reasonable assumptions backed by evidence and unfounded beliefs, when crises, such as pandemics, occur it may be too late to foster scientific reasoning - people rely on any prior beliefs and attitudes in interpreting new evidence, and those who are more prone to unfounded beliefs will be more vulnerable to any misinformation that occurs," Cavojova told PsyPost.

## More than a dozen archaeological surveys from early cities in Mesopotamia suggest those settlements may have faltered from overpopulation before climate-driven collapse ~4,200 years ago. How ancient societies responded to climate change could inform modern resilience.
