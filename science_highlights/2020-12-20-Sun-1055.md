## One-third of large rivers in the United States have changed colour over the past 35 years. Some US waterways have become greener and others yellower, providing clues to ecosystem health.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03592-8):

> One-third of large rivers in the United States have changed colour over the past 35 years. The team classified rivers across the United States as yellow, green or blue and catalogued colour changes over three and a half decades. The northwestern United States was a hotspot for rivers that became greener over time, whereas in the northeast, rivers were more likely to turn yellower.

## Study suggests the link between disgust and interracial romance is no longer strong or widespread. The new findings are in line with public opinion polling, which in 2013 found that 11% of Americans disapproved of marriages between Blacks and Whites, compared to 94% who disapproved in 1958.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/study-suggests-the-link-between-disgust-and-interracial-romance-is-not-strong-or-widespread-58838):

> The study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science, indicates that the link between interracial romance and disgust only for exists for some people and only under certain conditions. "Specifically, our interest was in testing whether there was, as hypothesized, a link between disgust and interracial couples. We thought conducting this work was particularly important not only for theoretical reasons but because of potential societal impacts. And as a child of an interracial couple, the work was also interesting on a personal level." "There may be some association between disgust and interracial couples, but when asked directly, very few people indicated any disgust toward any couple type, and overall, average disgust toward interracial couples was quite low. Thus, 'less not disgusted' might be a more appropriate conclusion than 'more disgusted,'" Laurent explained.

## Long-Term Cannabis Use Associated with Reduced Symptoms in Patients with Post-Traumatic Stress

Summary of [original article](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/can.2020.0056):

> Introduction: Given the increasing availability and use of cannabis among individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder and the addition of PTSD as an eligible diagnosis in several U.S. medical cannabis programs, the efficacy of dispensary-obtained cannabis needs to be thoroughly examined. Materials and Methods: This prospective study assessed PTSD symptoms and functioning every 3 months over the course of a year in two samples of participants diagnosed with PTSD: those with PTSD using dispensary-obtained cannabis and those with PTSD, who do not use cannabis. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the types of cannabis available in recreational and medical cannabis dispensaries might hold promise as an alternative treatment for PTSD. Randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to assess safety and determine how different preparations of cannabis impact PTSD and functioning.

## There is little evidence that unauthorized immigration to the United States increases terrorism. The "results suggest that despite voluminous political pronouncements to the contrary, unauthorized immigration has not been a central driver of terrorist activity in recent decades."

## Salt-tolerant bacteria with an appetite for sludge make biodegradable plastics

Summary of [original article](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2020/12/salt-tolerant-bacteria-with-an-appetite-for-sludge-make-biodegradable-plastics.html):

> In the September issue of the journal American Chemical Society Omega, the researchers have shown that the bacterium Zobellella denitrificans ZD1, found in mangroves, can consume sludge and wastewater to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a type of biopolymer that can be used in lieu of petroleum-based plastics. In particular, an abundance of carbon sources and a depletion of either nitrogen, phosphorous or oxygen, cause bacteria to erratically consume their carbon sources and produce polyhydroxybutyrate as a stress response. One such medium that can force bacteria to make polyhydroxybutyrate is crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel manufacturing.

## Fecal microbiota transplant promotes treatment response in melanoma patients previously unresponsive to immunotherapy in an early-stage clinical trial

> > Abstract
> 
> > The gut microbiome has been shown to influence the response of tumors to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in pre-clinical mouse models and observational patient cohorts. However, modulation of gut microbiota in cancer patients has not been investigated in clinical trials. Here we performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and re-induction of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in ten patients with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic melanoma. We observed clinical responses in three patients, including two partial responses and one complete response. Notably, treatment with FMT was associated with favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles in both the gut lamina propria and the tumor microenvironment. Together, these early findings have important implications for modulating the gut microbiota in cancer treatment.
> 
> "The trial included two FMT donors who had previously been treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy for metastatic melanoma and achieved a CR [complete response] for at least one year"
> 
> Although the clinical trial results are quite preliminary, biology never ceases to amaze... 
> 
> The mechanism seems to involve an understanding that the individual gut microbiota, which play a role in immune function, would influence the systemic response to immunotherapy. 
> 
> More specifically, the fecal donor is someone who has already responded to therapy. Based on data from animal studies, the gut microbiota composition of a treatment responder seems to confer benefit when transplanted to patients who are not responding to treatment for metastatic melanoma.

## Study sheds new light on how the brain distinguishes speech from noise. Researchers provide the first physiological evidence that a foundational center of the brain influences how sound is processed, identify a previously unknown neural circuit.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/lu-ssn121820.php):

> The neuromodulator, acetylcholine, may even help the main auditory brain circuitry distinguish speech from noise. "This study will likely bring new attention in the field to the ways in which circuits like this, widely considered a 'simple' one, are in fact highly complex and subject to modulatory influence like higher regions of the brain," says Burger. Burger and Zhang think these findings could shed new light on the contribution of neuromodulation to fundamental computational processes in auditory brainstem circuitry, and that it also has implications for understanding how other sensory information is processed in the brain.

> This is really cool and I hope we learn more about this. I have always had trouble distinguishing speech from other noise. Usually if I’m in a loud area like a bar or party I can only hear a wall a noise so it really stops my communication ability in a lot of social settings. My mom has told me she has the same problem so maybe this is also hereditary
