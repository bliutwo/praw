## COVID-19 cases could nearly double before Biden takes office. Proven model developed by Washington University, which accurately forecasted the rate of COVID-19 growth over the summer of 2020, predicts 20 million infected Americans by late January.

Summary of [original article](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/11/covid-19-cases-could-nearly-double-before-biden-takes-office/):

> The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are likely to increase to 20 million by the end of January, nearly doubling the current level of 11.4 million cases, predicts a Washington University in St. Louis COVID-19 forecasting model. If we continue, as a nation, at the current level of social distancing, the model forecasts that we are likely to reach 20 million cases before the end of January 2021. "However, more recently, testing has increased, and probably more like 25% of cases are diagnosed. In that case, total COVID cases would increase beyond 20 million in the next few months unless we, as a society, engage in more social distancing."

> I honestly think the reason the numbers are going up is that many people no longer care. Some people never did, but many did for a long time. They are now burnt out and want to live their lives regardless of the consequences. It may not be the right thing to do, and I agree it's selfish, but many people no longer give a $h1t.

## Wise reasoning is a mindset that can foster positive feelings amid interpersonal conflict, that involves recognizing where one’s knowledge is lacking, acknowledging multiple possible conclusions to a given situation, contemplating the perspectives of others, and seeking compromise.

> I think I do this...but i get very self conscious that I'm babbling and it annoys people. I also get self conscious that people think I'm trying to be smart.
> 
> I feel like people should be inherently uncertain about things which is why I adopted this mindset but it also makes it harder to make decisions sometimes. 
> 
> Like trying to see a spectrum of colours from white, it is difficult to make decisions when you're trying to see everything at once because there are just so many perspectives which are equally valid, it dilutes your understanding of right and wrong and the worst part is not everyone sees it this way so you have an impossible job explaining yourself to some circles, and in unfortunate circumstances some people just think you're being a smartass.
> 
> From personal experience, I think while this "wise reasoning" opens up more perspective, it also makes decision making harder because sometimes when considering everything there is no "right or wrong". Rather, we adopt the philosophy of "it is how it is". So how do you make a decision at that point? Either way, someone loses and someone wins.

## Effect of Vitamin D3 Supplements on Development of Advanced Cancer

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.25850):

> Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial with 25 871 patients, supplementation with vitamin D3 reduced the incidence of advanced cancer in the overall cohort, with strongest risk reduction in individuals with normal weight and no reduction among individuals with overweight or obesity. Objective To follow up on the possible reduction in cancer death in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial with an evaluation of whether vitamin D reduces the incidence of advanced cancer and an examination possible effect modification by body mass index. Among the 12 927 participants assigned to vitamin D treatment, 16 had incident metastatic cancer and also died from cancer during the trial period; among the 12 944 participants randomized to vitamin D placebo, 24 with incident metastatic cancer died from cancer within the randomization period.

> A double whammy? COVID and cancer protection? Though a very brief look at just the conclusions, makes me wonder two things. Does a deficiency make up you more likely to have cancer or is ‘extra’ protective. And If correct are ethnic minorities with dark skin more likely to get certain types of cancer in ‘cold’ countries ( to the extent that they are more likely to have lower Vitamin D levels I think)?

## Researchers find empirical evidence that social connection may be a "basic human need" like hunger. Social isolation (10 hours) induces cravings, and influences brain activity in the dopaminergic mid-brain similar to fasting.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/brain-study-social-connection-basic-human-need):

> It's crucial for people to "Pay attention to how much social contact they have," Tomova says, and "Be aware that loneliness and isolation are affecting their brains." Others argue social media activity can make people feel more connected, not less. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to the way fasting causes hunger.

`/u/TinFoilHeadphones` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jzkc2x/researchers_find_empirical_evidence_that_social/):

> I'd consider it more akin to an addiction as well.
> 
> I'm not saying that it's not a basic human need, but it's really easy to get used to spending a lot longer than 10 hours alone with no craving or needing.
> 
> Makes me think of withdrawal.

## Climate crisis: CO2 hits new record despite Covid-19 lockdowns

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/23/climate-crisis-co2-hits-new-record-despite-covid-19-lockdowns):

> Climate-heating gases have reached record levels in the atmosphere despite the global lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN's World Meteorological Organization has said. The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, published on Monday, shows CO2 in the atmosphere is now 50% higher than in 1750, before the Industrial Revolution. CO2 traps two-thirds of the heat retained on the Earth's surface by greenhouse gases, and this warming effect has increased by 45% since 1990.

## U.S. should look at how other high-income countries regulate health care costs. Standardizing fee-for-service payments and structuring negotiations between insurers and providers could make U.S. health care more affordable, finds new study based on France, Germany and Japan.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/ru-usl112020.php):

> The study, published in the journal Health Affairs, examined how other high-income countries that use a fee-for-service model regulate health care costs. In most countries with universal health insurance, physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis, yet health care prices there are lower than in the U.S. To lower health care spending, American policymakers have focused on eliminating fee-for-service reimbursement, which provides an incentive for performing additional services rather than setting up price negotiations to address the main factor that drives health care spending. According to Gusmano - who is also a member of the Rutgers Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research and Rutgers Global Health Institute - regardless of whether the United States will pursue fundamental policy changes such as Medicare for All or incremental expansion of the Affordable Care Act, both would require that policy makers address health care prices.

## Coral scientists from around the world come together to create a common framework to study coral bleaching, in the hope of speeding up research into the world's coral.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/scientists-organize-to-tackle-crisis-of-coral-bleaching/):

> Coral bleaching is a significant problem for the world's ocean ecosystems: When coral becomes bleached, it loses the algae that live inside it, turning it white. Coral can survive a bleaching but being bleached puts coral at higher risk for disease and death. Experiments to understand coral bleaching didn't really start in earnest until the 1990s - and a companion paper by many of the same authors found that two-thirds of the scientific papers about coral bleaching have been published in the last 10 years.
