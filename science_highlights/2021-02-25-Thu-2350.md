## Job applications from men are discriminated against when they apply for female-dominated occupations, such as nursing, childcare and house cleaning. However, in male-dominated occupations such as mechanics, truck drivers and IT, a new study found no discrimination against women.

## Effective anxiety therapy changes personality. Patients became more extroverted after treatment. In particular, they sought out social situations more and became more warm, friendly and interested in others. They were also more open to new experiences and activities

> In only 12 sessions? As someone who has been in therapy on and off for a few years, that sounds very impressive.
> 
> In my own personal experience, any time I manage to overcome the (social) anxiety, I do become far more chatty and extroverted almost immediately. Though in my case it tends to be short-lived, when the anxiety comes back.

## A stereotype suggests that atheists lack a moral compass, but a new study has shown that this is untrue. Atheists compared to believers are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion, but there were only minor differences between both groups for other moral values. (n=4,622)

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246593):

> How do the cultural,motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief reviewed above shape people's views about morality? To address this question, I rely on the conceptualization of the moral domain provided by Moral Foundations Theory [45, 46]. Although this theory is not without its critics [47-49] it is arguably the most ambitious, and most frequently used taxonomy of human moral values. As can be seen in Table H in S1 Text, both theorized antecedents of disbelief explained a large amount of variance in endorsement of binding moral foundations. The analysis is also expanded by investigating the link between religious disbelief and consequentialist moral reasoning, as well as the role of two additional presumed antecedents of disbelief.

> I’ve never understood the concept that you need a fear of punishment and hell to do the right thing. You know what the right thing to do is, if the only thing preventing you from raping, killing, and stealing is fear of punishment, I’m sorry, but you are a terrible person. If you truly believe without God that you would act that way, then there is something seriously wrong with you.

## The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has proven 94 percent effective in a study involving 1.2 million people in Israel, the first peer-reviewed real world research confirming the power of mass immunization campaigns to bring the pandemic to a close.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765):

> ConclusionsThis study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19-related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial. The phase 3 trial of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 included 21,720 persons who were randomly assigned to the vaccinated group, which permitted estimates of vaccine efficacy in only a small number of subpopulations. Two factors make the present study uniquely suited to evaluating the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a practical application: first, a rare combination of rich medical background data, Covid-19 PCR test results, and patient follow-up data in both community and inpatient settings - CHS has maintained such an integrated data repository for over half the Israeli population, and has updated it daily, for more than two decades; and second, the rapid pace and high uptake of Covid-19 vaccine in Israel and the high disease rates during the vaccination campaign.

> Wow. 94% is amazing. I thought it was impressive when we developed some of the first vaccines that were said to be around 75-80% effective.

> Modern medicine, you'll never cease to amaze me.

## People who believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories tend to struggle with scientific reasoning, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/02/people-who-believe-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-tend-to-struggle-with-scientific-reasoning-study-finds-59801):

> Individuals with a better grasp of scientific reasoning are less likely to fall prey to false conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new research published in the Journal of Health Psychology. The researchers found that those who strongly endorsed the coronavirus conspiracy beliefs tended to score low on the test of scientific reasoning. "The most important finding is that although scientific reasoning helps people to distinguish between reasonable assumptions backed by evidence and unfounded beliefs, when crises, such as pandemics, occur it may be too late to foster scientific reasoning - people rely on any prior beliefs and attitudes in interpreting new evidence, and those who are more prone to unfounded beliefs will be more vulnerable to any misinformation that occurs," Cavojova told PsyPost.

## Never before in over 1000 years has the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) been as weak as in the last decades. Study finds consistent evidence that its slowdown in the 20th century is unprecedented in the past millennium and is likely linked to human-caused climate change.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/gulf-stream-system-at-its-weakest-in-over-a-millennium):

> The researchers compiled so-called proxy data - taken mainly from natural archives like ocean sediments or ice cores - reaching back many hundreds of years to reconstruct the flow history of the AMOC. They found consistent evidence that its slowdown in the 20th century is unprecedented in the past millennium - it is likely linked to human-caused climate change. "The Gulf Stream System works like a giant conveyor belt, carrying warm surface water from the equator up north, and sending cold, low-salinity deep water back down south. It moves nearly 20 million cubic meters of water per second, almost a hundred times the Amazon flow," explains Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK, initiator of the study published in Nature Geoscience. "For the first time, we have combined a range of previous studies and found they provide a consistent picture of the AMOC evolution over the past 1600 years," says Rahmstorf.

## People automatically perceive wealthy individuals as highly competent and express more willingness to hire them, based on the assumption that wealthy people “earn” their wealth. This “rich and competent” belief can reduce economic mobility, making it more difficult for the working class to thrive

## Polar bears are working three times harder to hunt as Arctic ice melts

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/polar-bears-are-working-three-times-harder-to-hunt-as-arctic-ice-melts/):

> Arctic sea ice is causing polar bears to swim more often and narwhals to make more inefficient dives to escape killer whales and human disturbances, forms of travel that require three to four times more energy than walking on ice or normal dives, respectively. The average amount of Arctic sea ice in the month of September, when the ice extent is at an annual minimum, has fallen more than 13% per decade since 1979.Two marine-mammal researchers - Anthony Pagano, a postdoctoral researcher studying polar bears at San Diego Zoo Global, and Terrie Williams, an ecophysiologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz - compiled recent studies on polar bears and narwhals to determine how the ice-reliant species are being affected on a physiological level. More polar bears are expected to spend time on land as Arctic sea ice is predicted to continue shrinking or even disappear during September by 2050 "Few resources exist on land within the polar bears' range" to replace seals, according to Pagano and Williams.
