## For the first time researchers show that verses in religious scriptures that legitimize violence may increase support for killing enemies of the faith, based on a new study of Christians, Muslims and Jews in 7 countries using a quote from the Bible, Koran, or Torah (n=8,000).

Summary of [original article](https://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/violence-legitimizing-verses-in-religious-scriptures-increase-support-for-lethal-violence):

> Extremist perpetrators of violence often quote verses from their religion's holy scriptures that authorize, or even prescribe, attacks on enemies of the faith. Now, WZB researchers Ruud Koopmans and Eylem Kanol can prove for the first time that verses in religious scriptures that legitimize violence can increase support for killing enemies of the faith. The results show that reference to scriptural passages legitimizing violence significantly increased support for lethal violence in all three religions and in all seven countries.

## Scientists find new evidence linking essential oils to seizures: Analyzing 350 seizure cases, researchers found that 15.7% of seizures may have been induced by inhalation, ingestion or topical use of essential oils. After stopping use of oils, the vast majority did not experience another seizure.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/scientists-find-new-evidence-linking-essential-oils-to-seizures/):

> Certain essential oils have convulsant properties and have been associated with seizures for centuries, though everyday use of oils has generally been considered safe for the average person. Analyzing 350 seizure cases that spanned a four-year period, the researchers determined that 15.7%, or the seizures of 55 patients, may have been induced by the inhalation, ingestion or topical use of essential oils. All of the non-epileptic patients had been treated with anti-seizure medication for two to four weeks following their first seizure, and none of them had a recurrence of seizures after stopping their exposure to essential oils.

## People who believe that the world is just and everyone gets what they deserve are more likely to deem economic inequality as acceptable, especially in regard to the wealth of the bottom 10%.

> The only way to legitimize economic inequality is to ignore all the evidence that shows how damaging inequality is.  As to "everyone gets what they deserve", this is a fantasy the powerful tell themselves to justify their power, and has no basis in reality.

## First human experimental pain trial of CBD shows that pain relief is driven by BOTH pharmacological drug effects and psychological expectancy effects (placebo analgesia). Results showed that separate pain outcomes can be differentially affected by CBD and/or expectancies for receiving CBD.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/su-rsp_1042321.php#.YIN2YYUzop8.reddit):

> Among other findings, the data showed that CBD and expectancies for receiving CBD do not appear to reduce experimental pain intensity, but do make the pain feel less unpleasant. "We hypothesized that we would primarily detect expectancy-induced placebo analgesia. What we found though after measuring several different pain outcomes is that it's actually a little bit of both. That is, we found improvements in pain measures caused by the pharmacological effects of CBD and the psychological effects of just expecting that they had gotten CBD. It was pretty remarkable and surprising." Results from his previous study showed that while cannabinoid drugs weren't reducing the volume of pain, they were "Changing the channel making it a little less unpleasant." According to De Vita, "It's not sunshine and rainbows pleasant, but something slightly less bothersome. We replicated that in this study and found that CBD and expectancies didn't significantly reduce the volume of the pain, but they did make it less unpleasant-it didn't bother them as much." As part of the study De Vita and Maisto developed advanced experimental pain measurement protocols "To pop the hood and start looking at some of these other mechanistic pain processes," said De Vita.

## How local TV can push viewers to the political right: Living in an area with a TV news station owned by Sinclair, the U.S.'s 2nd-largest local TV company, makes viewers less likely to vote for Democratic presidential candidates and lowers their approval of Democratic presidents, suggests new study.

> I don't like the word "makes" when used in a scientific context. This isn't a controlled lab experiment, so causation cannot be tested. The proper language would say "is correlated with" instead of "makes." What if Sinclair targets conservative areas instead of its media "pushing" viewers? What if conservatives are more likely to settle in regions with local media that agrees with their views? Flashy headlines misrepresent science.
> 
> Edit: I looked into the article, and the researcher did account for the possibility that Sinclair purchased stations in conservative areas. He also said that living in these areas, people are "more likely" to lean politically right following a Sinclair purchase. He doesn't say that it "causes" the shift, just that they are associated. This guy's done his homework, and his results seem trustworthy, and being peer-reviewed, it's HIGHLY unlikely that there are serious logical or scientific errors in his paper. The problem isn't with the research, only the headline.

## Plastic waste can be put to use in nuclear radiation shielding. By incorporating recycled waste plastic and other byproducts from the iron and steel industry, researchers have created a more sustainable version of concrete that shields nuclear radiation better than standard concrete.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/plastic-waste-can-be-put-to-use-in-nuclear-radiation-shielding/):

> By incorporating recycled waste plastic and other byproducts from the iron and steel industry, researchers have created a more sustainable version of concrete that shields nuclear radiation better than standard concrete. "With the ever-increasing plastic waste and the numerous environmental problems [it] creates, we wanted to explore whether the waste plastic could be used for neutron radiation shielding," said first author Santhosh Malkapur, a civil engineer at Basaveshwar Engineering College, in India. Nuclear radiation is dangerous to humans, so it must be shielded in power plants, research sites and other areas with active nuclear radiation.

> Great!  That should provide a use for .00000001% of our plastic waste.

## Younger Brazilians increasingly hit by COVID-19, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSKBN2CA2KC):

> 2 Min Read.BRASILIA - Younger Brazilians are increasingly being affected by COVID-19, with those in their 20s showing the greatest increase in deaths so far this year, according to a report published by government biomedical institute Fiocruz on Friday. Brazil has been badly hit by the pandemic this year, with a slow vaccine rollout, patchy nationwide restrictions and a highly contagious new virus variant known as the P1 driving new infections. Several countries, including Canada and the United States, where new more transmissible virus variants are widely circulating, have reported that younger people are bearing the brunt of COVID-19 hospitalizations, unlike early in the pandemic when the elderly were hardest hit.

## Covid-19: Infections fell by 65% after first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, data shows. Researchers also found no evidence that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines differed in their ability to reduce infection rates (P>0.9), despite them leading to slightly different immune responses.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1068):

> The study found that 21 days after a single dose of either the AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine the rates of all new SARS-CoV-2 infections had fallen by 65%, symptomatic infections by 72%, and asymptomatic infections by 57%.Among people who had a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, infections were 70% lower and symptomatic infections 90% lower, similar to the effects in people who had previously been infected naturally. Koen Pouwels, senior researcher in Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Population Health and co-lead author of the study, said, "The protection from new infections gained from a single dose supports the decision to extend the time between first and second doses to 12 weeks to maximise initial vaccination coverage and reduce hospitalisations and deaths."However, the fact that we saw smaller reductions in asymptomatic infections than infections with symptoms highlights the potential for vaccinated individuals to get covid-19 again, and for limited ongoing transmission from vaccinated individuals, even if this is at a lower rate. Antibody levelsThe second study compared how antibody concentrations changed after a single dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, or after two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, among 45â€‰965 people in the survey.

> Infections of SARS-CoV-2 fell by 65% after a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, preliminary results from a large UK surveillance study indicate.
> 
> Reductions increased to 70% after a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, data from the UK Covid-19 Infection Survey show. Not enough people had yet received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to assess this.
> 
> The survey, carried out by the University of Oxford in partnership with the Office for National Statistics and the Department of Health and Social Care for England, included data from 1.7 million self-reported swab test results taken from 370â€‰000 UK adults between 1 December 2020 and 3 April 2021.
> 
> The results, published in two preprint papers,12 show that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine offered levels of protection against covid-19 that were similar to levels from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.
> 
> The benefits seem from the vaccines were similar in people over 75 and under 75 and in those with or without long term health conditions, the study found.
> 
> The researchers also found no evidence that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines differed in their ability to reduce infection rates (P>0.9), despite them leading to slightly different immune responses.
> 
> All participants showed at least some response to the vaccines, but the researchers noted that in the case of both vaccines a small percentage of people (around 5%) had a low response and said that it would be essential to monitor their response to a second vaccine dose.
> 
> The study found that 21 days after a single dose of either the AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine the rates of all new SARS-CoV-2 infections had fallen by 65% (95% confidence interval 60% to 70%), symptomatic infections by 72% (69% to 74%), and asymptomatic infections by 57% (64% to 47%) (P<0.001 for all).
