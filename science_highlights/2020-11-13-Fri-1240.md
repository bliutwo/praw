## Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that coronavirus can be transported long distances and droplet transmission alone cannot explain this. Airborne transmission of COVID-19 must be taken into consideration.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76442-2):

> Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards. Our findings may suggest both airborne dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 and possible long-distance dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 via ventilation air flow. The presented findings indicate airborne dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, especially considering the distance SARS-CoV-2 RNA was dispersed.

> Not a surprise - IIRC months ago there were cases in Taiwan and China where in an apartment building where people did not leave their dwellings and got infected nonetheless, a few floors away from the nearest infected individual.

## Vitamin D supplementation for 12 months appears to improve cognitive function through reducing oxidative stress regulated by increased telomere length (TL) in order adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Vitamin D may be a promising public health strategy to prevent cognitive decline.

Summary of [original article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164936/):

> Objective: To determine whether a 12-month vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive function in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and whether it is mediated through the mechanism in which telomere length regulate oxidative stress. According to mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA analysis, vitamin D group showed a significant enhancement in the FSIQ score for 12 months compared with the control. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation for 12 months appears to improve cognitive function through reducing oxidative stress regulated by increased TL in order adults with MCI. Vitamin D may be a promising public health strategy to prevent cognitive decline.

## Study finds that criminalization of sex work increases sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers by 58%, measured by biological tests

Summary of [original article](https://economics.harvard.edu/files/economics/files/ms31543.pdf?m=1604679900):

> 14 For the regressions using the sex worker data, Xist is a vector of covariates that includes individual controls for marital status, age, years of education, whether the sex worker has children, the number of years the sex worker has worked at the worksite, an estimated discount factor based on a hypothetical scenario to elicit time preferences, and an indicator for risk tolerance based on a risk game with monetary rewards, and Ss is a set of worksite fixed effects. 12 11 The STI prevalence among sex workers who leave sex work is of lesser importance from a public health perspective as these women will play a smaller role in the transmission of STIs compared to those who remain in sex work. Sex workers at criminalized worksites are less likely to have been surveyed in person and, conditional on conducting any follow-up survey, sex workers at criminalized worksites are more likely to have left sex work compared to sex workers at non-criminalized sites.

## Study: A higher frequency of alcohol consumption was surprisingly associated with reduced frequency of depressed mood in people with depression. This may potentially be due to the self-medicating use of alcohol by those with depression to manage their mood.

Summary of [original article](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/newscentre/news_centre/more_news_stories/less_screen_time_and_more_sleep_critical_for_preventing_depression):

> A significant relationship between physical activity, healthy diet, and optimal sleep was associated with less frequency of depressed mood. Over time, the lifestyle factors which were protective of depressed mood in both individuals with clinical depression and those without a depressive disorder was optimal sleep and lower screen time, while a better-quality diet was indicated to be protective of depressed mood in those without depression. "While people usually know that physical activity is important for mood, we now have additional data showing that adequate sleep and less screen time is also critical to reduce depression."

## Losing a few kilograms in weight almost halves people’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes – according to a study. These findings are important as they show that a ‘real-world’ lifestyle programme really can make a difference in helping people reduce their risk of Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes.

> I worked in drug discovery at a major pharma for a decade, mostly on type II diabetes drugs.  For most people good diet and exercise will cure type II diabetes.  Also for a lot of people taking a pill is easier than doing those two things.  It's why we made billions of dollars.
