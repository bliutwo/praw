## Researchers identify a new personality construct that describes “an ongoing feeling that the self is a victim”, the Tendency for Interpersonal Victimhood (TIV). It involves 4 dimensions: moral elitism, a lack of empathy, the need for recognition, and rumination.

## Gene therapy injection in one eye surprises scientists by improving vision in both. Injecting a gene therapy vector into one eye of someone suffering from LHON, the most common cause of mitochondrial blindness, significantly improves vision in both eyes, scientists have found.

> Some are hypothesising this to be related to the particular organisation of the anatomical pathways of the neurons of the eye. 
> 
> The eye is actually an outgrowth of the diencephalon during embryonic development, so is very much part of the brain - it is central nervous system tissue. 
> 
> The optic nerve travels towards the brain to transmit visual input from the eye via 'electrical signalling'. Fibres corresponding to the half of the retina (complex layer at back of eye) closest to the nose cross over at the optic chiasm (shaped like an X), which then moves to the other half of the brain (e.g. *left* eye nasal fibres go to the *right* brain)
> 
> They could probably test this hypothesis by conducting visual field testing (automated perimetry) and see if vision more so corresponding to the nasal retina (i.e. vision on the *temporal* side) exhibits most of the improvement. At the level of vision involved in Leber's, where many patients are legally blind, I'd guess that any visual gains would be related to visual fields rather than central visual acuity (macula/fovea).

## Wielding a gun makes a shooter perceive others as wielding a gun, too - the “gun embodiment effect” - finds a new randomized controlled trial. Accidental shootings of unarmed victims may sometimes happen because the shooter misperceived the victim as also having a gun.

> If you read the article and not just the headline, it seems like a very small increase of mistaking a gun and actually a slower response time to making a decision. 
> 
> "They also found that holding a gun affected participants’ accuracy, with a 1% greater likelihood to misperceive the other person as having a gun too."
> 
> "The researchers found strong evidence that when holding a gun, participants were a little slower to make their judgment about whether the other person was also holding a gun."
> 
> The headline doesn't really match the article, for whatever that's worth.

## Researchers have developed a new way to treat sewage that is much simpler, cheaper and greener than existing methods. The team found a new strain of bacterium called Thauera sp. strain SND5 that can remove both nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage.

## Dogs may never learn that every sound of a word matters. Despite their great hearing, dogs cannot tell the difference between words which differ in only one speech sound (dog vs dig), finds a new brain wave study. This may explain why the number of words dogs learn to recognize remains low.
