## High vitamin D levels may protect against COVID-19, especially for Black people - In a retrospective study of individuals tested for COVID-19, vitamin D levels above those traditionally considered sufficient were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19.

> Vitamin D seems to be a lot more important than we currently recognize. It might be one of those deficiencys that don't make themselves known like scurvy or what not but have a very negative impact to health overall

## Researchers analyzed tweets corresponding to week before and week after Trump’s tweet with phrase, “Chinese Virus.” When comparing week before to week after, there was significantly greater increase in anti-Asian hashtags associated with #chinesevirus (P < .001).

> “In addition, we did not code hashtags targeted to the Chinese government and conspiracy theories as anti-Asian. We took this approach because some hashtags are used to categorize information (e.g., curate a list of theories related the pandemic’s origins). This likely made our analyses more conservative by underestimating antipathy directed toward Asians.”

## Scientists designed new modular nanogenerators that can harvest energy from various different types of motion, such as ocean waves or a person's body movements. touchscreen taps, footsteps on flooring, & even raindrops rolling down solar cells.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/energy/water-filled-triboelectric-nanogenerators/):

> Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong have now designed new modular nanogenerators that can harvest energy from a variety of different types of motion, such as ocean waves or a person's body movements. Not only do they not need any other moving parts, like springs or rotors, but they can harvest energy from a range of different motions. "Our latest research has overcome the technical hurdles and will promote the use of nanogenerators, especially in"blue energy" harvesting, offering a new direction for the development of renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality.

## IBM researchers published details of an artificial intelligence that is capable of debating with humans. This hint at a future in which artificial intelligence can help humans to formulate and make sense of complex arguments.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00539-5):

> Writing in Nature, Slonim et al.1 report an impressive development in this field: Project Debater, an AI system that can engage with humans in debating competitions. Less than a decade ago, the analysis of human discourse to identify the ways in which evidence is adduced to support conclusions - a process now known as argument mining2 - was firmly beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art AI. Since then, a combination of technical advances in AI and increasing maturity in the engineering of argument technology, coupled with intense commercial demand, has led to rapid expansion of the field. Project Debater is a crucial step in the development of argument technology and in working with arguments as local phenomena.

## "Sperm remember a father’s environment (diet) and transmit that information to the embryo" by a non-DNA mechanism. Male mice with a folate-deficient diet produced sperm with altered histones, which "were transmitted at fertilization and remained in the developing embryo," leading to birth defects.

## Medical cannabis can reduce essential tremor by turning on overlooked cells in the central nervous system. Injecting a specific synthetic cannabinoid into the spinal cord of mice suffering from essential tremor reduces involuntary shaking by activating astrocytes.

## Research has found people who experience fewer stressors in daily life report better emotional stability, moods, and overall health. However, those who are less stressed score lower on cognitive tests than those who experience daily stressors

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/ps-las031921.php):

> A new study found that not only do some people report feeling no stress at all, but that there may be downsides to not experiencing stress. After analyzing the data, the researchers found that there did appear to be benefits for those who reported no stressors throughout the study, about 10 percent of the participants. Almeida said the findings - recently published in the journal Emotion - suggest that it may not be as important to avoid stress as it is to change how you respond to stress.

> Doesn’t this just lend credence to the saying “ignorance is bliss”? I’d rather have a lower cognitive score than deal with stress.

## Study of medical students finds sexual harassment is a significant issue with 58.9% being exposed to sexually harassing behavior. >80% of unwanted sexual contact and verbal harassment victims were female. 8.5% (all female) faced forced sexual penetration. The most common perpetrators were patients
