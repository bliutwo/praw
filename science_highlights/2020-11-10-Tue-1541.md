## Conservatives tend to see expert evidence & personal experience as more equally legitimate than liberals, who put a lot more weight on scientific perspective. The study adds nuance to a common claim that conservatives want to hear both sides, even for settled science that’s not really up for debate.

## Social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also protected against many other diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. But susceptibility to those other diseases could be increasing, resulting in large outbreaks when masking and distancing stop

> The researchers used an epidemiological model based on historic RSV data and observations of the recent decline in RSV cases to examine the possible impact of COVID-19 NPIs on future RSV outbreaks in the United States and Mexico. These outbreaks were often delayed following the end of the NPI period, with peak cases projected to occur in many locations in winter 2021-22. "The decrease in cases of influenza and RSV - as well as the possible future increase we project - is arguably the broadest global impact of NPIs across a variety of human diseases that we've seen," said co-author Bryan Grenfell.

## People with a greater sense of entitlement are less likely to comply with COVID-19 health guidelines, such as washing their hands more often and social distancing, according to a new study

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/psychological-entitlement-predicts-non-compliance-with-covid-19-health-guidelines-study-finds-58508):

> "In previous research, my adviser, Doctor Emily Zitek, demonstrated that feelings of psychological entitlement can lead others to fail to follow the rules, especially rules they perceive are unfair. And so we became interested in understanding if people higher in psychological entitlement are similarly less likely to follow the COVID-19 health guidelines," Schlund said. "As we predicted, people higher in psychological entitlement reported less compliance with the COVID-19 health guidelines than people lower in psychological entitlement. For example, people higher in psychological entitlement were more likely to report that they would still attend parties if they felt like it, and that they were not engaging in social distancing, making efforts to wash their hands more, or even simply following the rules put in place by their state," Schlund told PsyPost. "Our research also makes an important contribution to our understanding of psychological entitlement. In one of the most influential models of psychological entitlement, Grubbs and Exline propose that psychological entitlement can increase one's vulnerability to psychological distress. We found that psychological entitlement can also increase one's susceptibility to contracting a potentially severe illness. Thus, being entitled may pose detrimental effects both psychologically and physically."

## Study: Hydroxychloroquine no better than placebo for hospitalized COVID-19 patients

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/11/09/Study-Hydroxychloroquine-no-better-than-placebo-for-COVID-19-patients/7711604934110/):

> Nov. 9 - COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed no signs of significant improvement in "Clinical status" compared with those given a placebo, a study published Monday by JAMA found. "The results show that hydroxychloroquine did not help patients recover from COVID-19," study co-author Dr. Wesley H. Self told UPI. "In the study, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and those treated with a placebo had nearly identical outcomes, [so] I do not foresee any role for hydroxychloroquine in acutely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19," said Self, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "Our results, especially when combined from other studies conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, are good evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not provide benefit for patients hospitalized with COVID-19," Self said.

Derek Lowe has good summaries of both on his *Science: In The Pipeline* blog: [The RECOVERY Trial Reports on Hydroxychloroquine](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/05/the-recovery-trial-reports-on-hydroxychloroquine), [The SOLIDARITY Data](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/10/16/the-solidarity-data). A combination of the two trials with 27 smaller randomized trials found no benefit from the drug (RR=1.10, 0.99-1.22). Due to the lack of efficacy and potential risk, both RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY have discontinued the hydroxychloroquine arms of their trials.

## To avoid the problem of inbreeding, female banded mongooses lead their groups into fights then try to mate with enemy males in the chaos of battle, new research shows. "Exploitative leadership" of this kind, which is also seen in human warfare, leads to frequent and damaging conflicts.

## Computer model representing 98 million Americans' mobility in ten major U.S. cities during the pandemic pinpoints four high-risk "superspreader" sites: restaurants, gyms, hotels, and cafes. To slow Covid-19’s spread without full lockdown, the team recommends targeted occupancy caps in these places.

## Three consecutive dry winters (2015–2017) in southwestern South Africa resulted in the Cape Town “Day Zero” drought in early 2018. Modelling results indicate that anthropogenic climate change increased the likelihood of the 2015–2017 rainfall deficit by a factor of five to six.
