## Study: 34% of employees experienced workplace mistreatment and 44% of employees witnessed mistreatment. The cost due to increased sickness absences ranged up to $1.97T annually. Also, prevalence rates of mistreatment were lowest in countries where greater legal protections are offered to workers.

> "We next used our meta-analytic prevalence rate estimates to infer the financial cost of mistreatment due to increased sickness absences and productivity loss. The estimated cost ranged from $691.70 billion to $1.97 trillion annually."
> 
> Okay, so mistreating workers be it financially, emotionally or even physically leads to financial loss for firms in terms of missed productivity. Laws protecting workers decreases mistreatment prevalence.
> 
>  It's nice that empirical findings at least now backs up what we already know.

## Cleaner air has boosted U.S. corn and soybean yields according to new research from Stanford University. The analysis estimates pollution reductions between 1999 and 2019 contributed to a 20% increase in corn and soybean yield gains during that period, an amount worth about $5 billion per year.

Summary of [original article](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/07/01/clean-air-boosts-crop-yields/):

> Lobell and Burney extended their analysis back to 1990, when Congress passed Clean Air Act amendments that resulted in significant air quality improvements across the country. The researchers looked through air pollution data from hundreds of monitoring stations around the region, federal data on power plant emissions, satellite-based observations of nitrogen dioxide around those power plants, crop yield data from federal surveys and satellite imagery, as well as weather data to account for growing season conditions known to explain crop yield variations. The reduction in air pollution contributed to an estimated 4 percent growth in corn yields and 3 percent growth in soybean yields - increases that equal 19 percent of corn's overall yield gains during the timeframe and 23 percent of soybeans' overall yield gains.

> I think it's amazing how they can use satellites to pinpoint the exact pollutants and the difference between two farms next to one another.
> 
> I wrote an idea for r/scificoncepts that had this in mind, I just didn't know it was already being used like this. I was thinking how if we could track all the pollutants given off by companies then that would be an airtight way of forcing them to pay compensation.
> 
> Even just forcing compensation for the loss in yields in other industries would be great. Food scarcity will become a huge issue with climate change. We will need every percentage of that yield very soon.

## People’s personal experiences with nature may work better than dire warnings to motivate environmental action. Interaction with local species in science classes and outdoor experiences may build lifelong awareness, concern and actions for the environment

## The CRISPR gene-editing tool has been successfully used in space for the first time. Researchers onboard the International Space Station have edited colonies of yeast to study how they repair DNA damage.

> The CRISPR gene-editing tool has been successfully used in space for the first time. Researchers onboard the International Space Station have edited colonies of yeast to study how they repair DNA damage, which could be the first steps towards finding ways to protect astronauts against the radiation of space. So for the new study, researchers on a project called Genes In Space investigated whether CRISPR behaved any differently in the microgravity environment of space.

## New research provides evidence that Black women are less likely than their White counterparts to be afforded the protection that can often come with perceptions of femininity. This, in turn, can make police violence against Black women seem more justifiable.

## A new study implies Tyrannosaurs lived in social groups

`/u/shillyshally` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/odg3pm/a_new_study_implies_tyrannosaurs_lived_in_social/):

> "Two decades ago, Phillip Currie, a Canadian palaeontologist, suggested tyrannosaurs were pack hunters with a complex social structure. He raised this hypothesis based on a similar discovery in Alberta, Canada. Most scientists dismissed this idea. They doubted tyrannosaurs had the mental capacity to form these behaviors and behaved in a similar way to modern reptiles like crocodiles."

> We have quite the history of assuming other life forms are stupid. If this study is confirmed, yet another Jurassic part will have to be made. Smarter, faster, more sociable!
> 
> My first dinosaur book depicted a brontosaurus half submerged in a swamp and T-rex lumbering and dragging its tail. It's been an exciting three quarters of a century following all the breakthroughs.

## Invisible bursts of electricity from volcanoes signal explosive eruptions

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invisible-bursts-electricity-volcano-explosive-eruptions-warning/amp?__twitter_impression=true):

> Now, an analysis of 97 explosions at Sakurajima from June 2015 is helping to show when eruptions produce visible lightning strokes versus when they produce the mysterious, unseen surges of electrical activity, researchers report in the June 16 Geophysical Research Letters. These invisible bursts, called vent discharges, happen early in eruptions, which could allow scientists to figure out ways to use them to warn of impending explosions. Vent discharges, on the other hand, are relatively newly detected bursts of electrical activity, which produce a continuous, high-frequency signal for seconds - an eternity compared with lightning.
