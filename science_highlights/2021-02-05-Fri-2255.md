## Tom Hanks' COVID-19 diagnosis likely shaped behaviors, thoughts toward virus. Hanks’ disclosure inspired some people to seek more information and/or take stricter precautions. Public health advocates may want to use celebrity announcements to reach people who may be harder to reach.

Summary of [original article](https://news.psu.edu/story/646649/2021/02/04/research/tom-hanks-covid-19-diagnosis-likely-shaped-behaviors-thoughts):

> UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.- When actor Tom Hanks announced his COVID-19 diagnosis on March 11, 2020, many Americans were still learning about the virus and its severity. The results indicated that people who identified with Hanks or said they knew him were more likely to change their thoughts or COVID-related behaviors due to the announcement. The researchers showed half of these participants the Facebook post where Hanks announced his COVID-19 diagnosis and the other half a non-COVID Hanks post.

> I admittedly laughed at the Netflix special Death to 2020 when the narrator (who’s played by ~~Hugh Grant~~^Laurence ^Fishburne) says, “In a desperate bid for attention the COVID-19 virus infects beloved actor Tom Hanks.”
> 
> Edit - u/friendsfoundmyoldone reminded me the narrator was the amazing Laurence Fishburne not Hugh Grant

## Fecal transplant turns cancer immunotherapy non-responders into responders - Scientists transplanted fecal samples from patients who respond well to immunotherapy to advanced melanoma patients who don’t respond, to turn them into responders, raising hope for microbiome-based therapies of cancers.

## Crying as a result of listening to music is complex and personal, but most people consider it to be a pleasant experience — and one that’s more likely to happen late at night and when alone.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/why-does-music-make-us-cry/):

> Most crying episodes lasted less than five minutes, and it was rare for either men or women to cry for longer than 15 minutes due to music. The paper concluded that crying over music differs from weeping in general because there are smaller differences between women and men in how they experience crying to music versus regular weeping, the emotions experienced while crying over music skew toward being moved and are not largely negative, and observers interact differently with the crier when the cause is music. For future research on the intersection of music and weeping, the authors suggested aiming to better understand the situations in which people cry over music, since the emotional experiences of crying episodes seem to depend on environmental context.

## US States with statewide mask mandates reported a decline in weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates by up to 5.5 percentage points for adults aged 18–64 years after mandate implementation, finds new CDC study.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006e2.htm?s_cid=mm7006e2_w):

> During March 22-October 17, 2020, 10 sites participating in the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network in states with statewide mask mandates reported a decline in weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization growth rates by up to 5.5 percentage points for adults aged 18-64 years after mandate implementation, compared with growth rates during the 4 weeks preceding implementation of the mandate. This study examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups in 10 sites participating in the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network in states that issued statewide mask mandates during March 1-October 17, 2020. Using hospitalization growth rates before mask mandates were implemented, the model predicted hospitalization growth rates after mask mandates, assuming mandates had not been implemented.

## Local police cooperation with ICE can undermine public safety. When local police cooperate with ICE, Latino communities are deterred from reporting crime.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/05/when-local-police-cooperate-with-ice-latino-communities-under-report-crime-heres-data/):

> With such policies potentially affecting at least 18.4 percent of the U.S. population that is Latino, as well as both Latino and non-Latino undocumented immigrants, here's how cooperation between federal immigration enforcement and local police negatively affects public health and safety. As a result, these policies directly undermine the health and safety of both the approximately 10.5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and their broader communities. If the Biden administration wishes to keep immigrants and Latino communities protected from crime, illness, child hunger and other such public health dangers, it may wish to show how the previous administration's immigration policies undermined those goals.

## Big creatures — which have many more cells — should develop tumors more frequently. A new study shows that elephants possess a large toolbox of genes for evading cancer, and suggests that evolution of tumor suppression capabilities contributed to the development of big bodies

Summary of [original article](http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2021/02/007.html):

> In the new study, "We explored how elephants and their living and extinct relatives evolved to be cancer-resistant," Lynch says. "We have past research looking at TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor. This time, we said, 'Let's just look at whether the entire elephant genome includes more copies of tumor suppressors than what you'd expect.' Is the trend general? Or is the trend specific to one gene? We found that it was general: Elephants have lots and lots and lots of extra copies of tumor suppressor genes, and they all contribute probably a little bit to cancer resistance." "By determining how big, long-lived species evolved better ways to suppress cancer we can learn something new about how evolution works and hopefully find ways to use that knowledge to inspire new cancer treatments," says Vazquez, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley who completed much of the project while earning his PhD at the University of Chicago.

> I remember being taught that BMR was relevant here, and that small and highly metabolically active organisms would have a much higher mitosis rate. More cell divisions = higher risk of cancer. Can anyone clarify?

## Researchers from Japan have developed a novel minimally invasive and accurate method using infrared imaging and machine learning to distinguish between normal tissue and tumor areas. This technique has a strong potential for widespread clinical use.

Summary of [original article](https://www.tus.ac.jp/en/mediarelations/archive/20210202_0102_en.html):

> The scientists found that even though 10 out of the 12 test tumors were completely or partly covered by a mucosal layer, the machine-learning analysis was effective in identifying GISTs, correctly color-coding tumor and non-tumor sections at 86% accuracy. The machine learning technique developed by Dr. Takemura and team could distinguish tumor tissue from healthy tissue in ex vivo images of resected tumors, with 86% accuracy Photo courtesy: Hiroshi Takemura from Tokyo University of Science. The researchers identified several areas that would improve on their results, such as making their training dataset much larger, adding information about how deep the tumor is for the machine-learning algorithm, and including other types of tumors in the analysis.
