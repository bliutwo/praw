## Social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also protected against many other diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. But susceptibility to those other diseases could be increasing, resulting in large outbreaks when masking and distancing stop

Summary of [original article](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/09/large-delayed-outbreaks-endemic-diseases-possible-following-covid-19-controls):

> The researchers used an epidemiological model based on historic RSV data and observations of the recent decline in RSV cases to examine the possible impact of COVID-19 NPIs on future RSV outbreaks in the United States and Mexico. These outbreaks were often delayed following the end of the NPI period, with peak cases projected to occur in many locations in winter 2021-22. "The decrease in cases of influenza and RSV - as well as the possible future increase we project - is arguably the broadest global impact of NPIs across a variety of human diseases that we've seen," said co-author Bryan Grenfell.

> I've been suspecting this as well, that when we all come out of our caves we are going to be ripe for the picking. It's healthy to have a certain amount of disease flow when there's not a bad pandemic going on. Just like you can't disinfect every germ in the world.

## Study: Hydroxychloroquine no better than placebo for hospitalized COVID-19 patients

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/11/09/Study-Hydroxychloroquine-no-better-than-placebo-for-COVID-19-patients/7711604934110/):

> Nov. 9 - COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed no signs of significant improvement in "Clinical status" compared with those given a placebo, a study published Monday by JAMA found. "The results show that hydroxychloroquine did not help patients recover from COVID-19," study co-author Dr. Wesley H. Self told UPI. "In the study, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and those treated with a placebo had nearly identical outcomes, [so] I do not foresee any role for hydroxychloroquine in acutely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19," said Self, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "Our results, especially when combined from other studies conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil, are good evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not provide benefit for patients hospitalized with COVID-19," Self said.

Derek Lowe has good summaries of both on his *Science: In The Pipeline* blog: [The RECOVERY Trial Reports on Hydroxychloroquine](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/05/the-recovery-trial-reports-on-hydroxychloroquine), [The SOLIDARITY Data](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/10/16/the-solidarity-data). A combination of the two trials with 27 smaller randomized trials found no benefit from the drug (RR=1.10, 0.99-1.22). Due to the lack of efficacy and potential risk, both RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY have discontinued the hydroxychloroquine arms of their trials.

## People with a greater sense of entitlement are less likely to comply with COVID-19 health guidelines, such as washing their hands more often and social distancing, according to a new study

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/psychological-entitlement-predicts-non-compliance-with-covid-19-health-guidelines-study-finds-58508):

> "In previous research, my adviser, Doctor Emily Zitek, demonstrated that feelings of psychological entitlement can lead others to fail to follow the rules, especially rules they perceive are unfair. And so we became interested in understanding if people higher in psychological entitlement are similarly less likely to follow the COVID-19 health guidelines," Schlund said. "As we predicted, people higher in psychological entitlement reported less compliance with the COVID-19 health guidelines than people lower in psychological entitlement. For example, people higher in psychological entitlement were more likely to report that they would still attend parties if they felt like it, and that they were not engaging in social distancing, making efforts to wash their hands more, or even simply following the rules put in place by their state," Schlund told PsyPost. "Our research also makes an important contribution to our understanding of psychological entitlement. In one of the most influential models of psychological entitlement, Grubbs and Exline propose that psychological entitlement can increase one's vulnerability to psychological distress. We found that psychological entitlement can also increase one's susceptibility to contracting a potentially severe illness. Thus, being entitled may pose detrimental effects both psychologically and physically."

> A study at least 25 years ago looked at this and found that surgeons were no more likely to wash their hands in a public restroom than most other professions, despite saying that they wash every time.  Social workers and health inspectors were the most likely group to actually wash.

## Conservatives tend to see expert evidence & personal experience as more equally legitimate than liberals, who put a lot more weight on scientific perspective. The study adds nuance to a common claim that conservatives want to hear both sides, even for settled science that’s not really up for debate.

## When politicians have hiring discretion, public sector jobs often go to the least capable but most politically connected applicants. Patronage hires led to significant turnover in local bureaucracies after elections, which in turn likely disrupted the provision of public goods like education.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/patronage-selection-public-sector-brazil):

> In practice, when politicians have hiring discretion, public sector jobs often go to the least capable but most politically connected applicants, according to a paper in the October issue of the American Economic Review. Tracked the public sector careers of about two million supporters of local parties in Brazil from 1997 to 2014. The chart shows clear evidence that political favoritism is prevalent in the Brazilian public sector.

## Neuroscientists have identified "time cells" in the brain that support the temporal organization of episodic memories.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/26/2013250117):

> Single Neurons in the Human Hippocampus and Entorhinal Cortex Encode the Passage of Time.To represent temporal information, time cells fire at a preferred time interval-their time field-that is defined relative to the beginning and end of a period of fixed duration. Of the 79 total encoding time cells and 60 total retrieval time cells, 16 behaved as time cells in both periods, supporting previous work demonstrating context-dependent recruitment of unique subsets of time cells that partially overlap. The existence of time cells in rodents with properties analogous to place cells sparked significant interest among both human and rodent memory researchers because time cells offer a unifying mechanism for the representation of both spatial and temporal context.

> Just to clarify. This was found in mouse models years ago. They were able to confirm said theory in humans which is what this paper is based on.

## Diet and lifestyle during pregnancy linked to modifications in infants’ DNA: A new study has shown pregnant women with obesity could reduce the health risks for their infants through improved diet and more physical activity

Summary of [original article](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2020/11/gestational-diabetes.page):

> Research published in the journal PLosMed investigates the impact of high glucose in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus and changes to infants DNA. GDM is becoming more frequent around the world alongside a rise in obesity and can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth as well as increasing the risk of metabolic disease in the child in later life. They then looked at whether a dietary and physical activity intervention during pregnancy altered these modifications in infants born to mothers who developed GDM. The results showed that GDM and high glucose levels in mothers were linked to changes in the level and pattern of functional modification to the infants DNA. Moreover, they found that the dietary and exercise intervention significantly reduced these methylation changes in the infant associated with GDM in the mothers. Professor Lucilla Poston, Tommy's Chair of Maternal & Fetal Health and lead investigator of the UPBEAT trial at King's College London, said: "We have known for some time that children of mothers who had gestational diabetes are a greater risk of obesity and poor control of glucose; this new research implies that epigenetic pathways could be involved."

## New species of flying reptile discovered by paleontologists

Summary of [original article](https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/education/mysterious-flying-reptile-soared-above-dinosaurs-discovered-portsmouth-researchers-3030872):

> University of Portsmouth PhD student Roy Smith was examining fossils of shark spines - when he realised that some of the fossils were not like the rest. The fossils were actually fragments of jaws of toothless pterosaurs, a type of flying reptile that lived more than 60 million years ago, according to the Portsmouth student. 'Two of the specimens discovered can be identified as a pterosaur called Ornithostoma, but one additional specimen is clearly distinct and represents a new species.
