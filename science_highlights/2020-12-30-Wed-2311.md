## Violent video games do not appear to be linked to aggression, finds new meta-analysis. There may be a stronger relationship with desensitization. Games are now more important than ever for socialization, feeling autonomy and control during an uncertain time, and just de-stressing.

> Games and sports have always been a marker of civilization. I'm not sure why digital media went through a stigmatized period as there are clearly strategic and skill requirements associated with many games (like popular ancient games such as chess and sudoku)
> 
> I'm glad that "gaming" is being more recognized as a popular medium of entertainment

## People high in trait machiavellianism are more likely to climb the corporate ladder by leaving lasting impressions with influential people in leadership positions, mostly through an ability to capitalize on social situations and expand their networks.

> The "machiavellianism" trait described in the article is essentially "being a schemer." If you're a schemer, you use your charm and networking skills to impress the higher-ups. 
> 
> Not very surprising. Note the article doesn't imply that there are no other ways to be successful at work - just that this is how schemers wind up being successful.

## Men in the military who were randomly assigned to mixed-gender squads for eight weeks developed more egalitarian attitudes than those assigned to male squads. Contrary to some predictions, the integration of women into squads did not reduce male recruits' performance. [Experimental data from Norway]

## Feelings of gratitude motivate people to maintain romantic relationships. People automatically evaluated romantic partners who expressed gratitude more favorably and thus became more committed; however, if romantic partners did not reciprocate such gratitude, they became less committed.

> I remeber my ex wife's "thank yous" fell of deaf ears after a while because her actions never reflected gratitude. "Thank you for doing the laundry" means nothing when you leave all your dirty clothes in the bathroom, make excuses every time I ask for help, and actively avoid pulling your weight.

> Point being, gratitude isn't just *saying* things. It's actions too.

## Regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants has been associated with the development of food allergies by scientists from the United Kingdom. Their findings provide new insight on this important public health problem.

Summary of [original article](https://www.immunofrontiers.com/regular-moisturizer-use-on-infant-skin-associated-with-food-allergy-onset):

> A new study by researchers from St. George's, University of London, supports the "Notion that regular application" of moisturizers to young infants' skin could contribute to the onset of food allergies later in life through a process known as transcutaneous sensitization. Based on their analysis of data from the EAT study, the scientists noted a "Statistically significant dose-response relationship" between food allergy development and "Parent-reported moisturization frequency at 3 months of age," such that "Each additional moisturization per week was associated with an ORadj 1.20(95% CI 1.13-591.27), p<0.0005 for developing food allergy." The scientists concluded that "These findings support the notion that regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants may promote the development of food allergy through transcutaneous sensitization" and that "Frequent skin moisturization in early life might promote the development of food allergy, most likely through transcutaneous sensitization."

> Atopy is atopy.
> 
> Newborns needing moisturizers on skin have an atopic nature and the application of moisturizer isn't causative, it just correlates.

## Undocumented immigration to the United States has a beneficial impact on the employment and wages of Americans. Strict immigration enforcement, in particular deportation raids targeting workplaces, is detrimental for all workers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20190042):

> This paper studies the labor market effects of both documented and undocumented immigration in a search model featuring nonrandom hiring. Immigration leads to the creation of additional jobs but also raises competition for natives. The dominant effect depends on the fall in wage costs, which is larger for undocumented immigration than it is for legal immigration.

> Did anyone read this paper?  The abstract is hard to understand and it doesn't seem to be saying the same thing that the title of this post is saying.

## Hydrogen derived from basaltic rocks can support microbial life in the absence of sunlight, a study finds.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/16/2007051117?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=twitter&utm_term=&utm_content=ef2fe95c-f23d-4d6c-a03c-7b7540784a37&utm_campaign=General):

> In catchments containing abundant sedimentary carbonates and shales, the biological oxidation of pyrite has been suggested to be a primary control on the composition of subglacial sediment microbiomes, likely due to its potential role in supplying reductant to drive primary production. Our results are discussed in consideration of the role of bedrock type in supporting H2-dependent primary production in diverse subglacial and proglacial sediment habitats in contemporary and past environments on Earth and in subglacial habitats on extraterrestrial icy planetary bodies such as Enceladus. To begin to assess the role of H2 in supporting microbial life in subglacial and proglacial habitats, potential rates of net H2 oxidation were determined in microcosm assays amended with H2 and CO2 with or without one of several common oxidants, including SO42−, hematite, ferrihydrite, NO3−, and O2. In microcosms prepared without sediments or with autoclaved sediments, net H2 loss was equivalent to loss due to sample removal.
