## Actual COVID-19 Cases Could Be 6 Times Greater Than Official Figures. A newly modelled estimate from the United States, Australia, Canada, South Korea and 11 countries in Europe suggests official figures could be struggling to capture the full scale of the outbreak.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-actual-number-of-covid-19-cases-is-far-higher-than-official-figures-in-many-nations):

> According to their results, at the end of August the population infection rate was, on average, six times higher than reported cases. In South Korea, the actual number of infections was found to be 2.6 times higher than reported figures, whereas in Italy, the 'backcasted' number of cases was a startling 17.5 times higher. Most nations have taken far fewer tests among their populations, which suggests the number of people globally who have been infected with COVID-19 is likely several times greater than official figures.

## Scientists produce rare diamonds in minutes at room temperature

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/materials/scientists-rare-diamonds-minutes-room-temperature/):

> While traditional diamonds are formed over billions of years deep in the Earth where extreme pressures and temperatures provide just the right conditions to crystalize carbon, scientists are working on more expedient ways of forging the precious stones. These regular diamonds are the type you might find in an engagement ring, while Lonsdaleite diamonds are rarer and found at meteorite impact sites. The team hopes the technique can enable them to produce meaningful quantities of these artificial diamonds, particularly Lonsdaleite, which is predicted to be 58 percent harder than regular diamonds.

## Scientists reprogram immune B cells using CRISPR to produce same broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies found in rare HIV patients. These engineered immune cells elicit broad response to HIV in mice, offering hope for vaccine or functional cure against numerous strains of the fast-evolving virus.

Summary of [original article](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2020/20201118-voss-hiv.html):

> This week, scientists at Scripps Research moved closer to attaining that holy grail of HIV research with a new vaccine approach that would rely on genetically engineered immune cells from the patient's body. Voss and his team showed in 2019 that it was possible to reprogram the antibody genes of the immune system's B cells using CRISPR so the cells would produce the same broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies that have been found in rare HIV patients. The new study shows that such engineered B cells, after being reintroduced to the body, can multiply in response to a vaccination-and mature into memory cells and plasma cells that produce high levels of protective antibodies for long periods of time in the body.

> Abstract
> 
> HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) can suppress viremia and protect against HIV infection. However, their elicitation is made difficult by low frequencies of appropriate precursor B cell receptors and the complex maturation pathways required to generate bnAbs from these precursors. Antibody genes can be engineered into B cells for expression as both a functional antigen receptor on cell surfaces and as secreted antibody. Here, we show that HIV bnAb-engineered primary mouse B cells can be adoptively transferred and vaccinated in immunocompetent mice resulting in the expansion of durable bnAb memory and long-lived plasma cells. Somatic hypermutation after immunization indicates that engineered cells have the capacity to respond to an evolving pathogen. These results encourage further exploration of engineered B cell vaccines as a strategy for durable elicitation of HIV bnAbs to protect against infection and as a contributor to a functional HIV cure.

## The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine shows a strong immune response. Two weeks after the second dose, more than 99% of participants had neutralising antibody responses. These included people of all ages, raising hopes that it can protect age groups most at risk from the coronavirus.

## CRISPR-based genome editing system targets cancer cells and destroys them by genetic manipulation. A single treatment doubled the average life expectancy of mice with glioblastoma, improving their overall survival rate by 30%, and in metastatic ovarian cancer increased their survival rate by 80%.

Summary of [original article](https://aftau.org/news_item/revolutionary-crispr-based-genome-editing-system-treatment-destroys-cancer-cells/):

> Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of brain cancer, with a life expectancy of 15 months after diagnosis and a five-year survival rate of only 3%. The researchers demonstrated that a single treatment with CRISPR-LNPs doubled the average life expectancy of mice with glioblastoma tumors, improving their overall survival rate by about 30%. Ovarian cancer is a major cause of death among women and the most lethal cancer of the female reproductive system. Treatment with CRISPR-LNPs in a metastatic ovarian cancer mice model increased their overall survival rate by 80%. "The CRISPR genome editing technology, capable of identifying and altering any genetic segment, has revolutionized our ability to disrupt, repair or even replace genes in a personalized manner," said Prof. Peer. "Despite its extensive use in research, clinical implementation is still in its infancy because an effective delivery system is needed to safely and accurately deliver the CRISPR to its target cells. The delivery system we developed targets the DNA responsible for the cancer cells' survival. This is an innovative treatment for aggressive cancers that have no effective treatments today."

## Vibrations of the protein spikes on coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, play a crucial part in allowing the virus to penetrate human cells. Study found a strong direct relationship between the rate & intensity of the spikes’ vibrations & how readily the virus could penetrate the cell.

Summary of [original article](https://news.mit.edu/2020/vibrations-coronavirus-proteins-1119):

> As soon as Covid-19 appeared and information about the virus' protein composition became available, Buehler and Hu, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering, swung into action to see if the mechanical properties of the proteins played a role in their interaction with the human body. "You can just look at the fluctuations of these spike proteins and find out how they may act on the epidemiological side, like how infectious and how serious would the disease be." Potentially, these findings could also provide a new avenue for research on possible treatments for Covid-19 and other coronavirus diseases, Buehler says, speculating that it might be possible to find a molecule that would bind to the spike proteins in a way that would stiffen them and limit their vibrations.
