## Research finds fully vaccinated adults 65 and older were 94% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than people of the same age who were not vaccinated, according to the CDC. People who were partially vaccinated were 64% less likely to be hospitalized with the disease than the unvaccinated.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0428-vaccinated-adults-less-hospitalized.html):

> Both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines authorized and recommended in the United States protect against COVID-19-related hospitalization among adults 65 years and older, according to a new CDC assessment that finds fully vaccinated adults 65 years and older were 94% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than people of the same age who were not vaccinated. People 65 and older who were partially vaccinated were 64% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than people who were not vaccinated. The findings provide additional support for CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination among people 65 and older in the U.S. population under the Emergency Use Authorization for the applicable COVID-19 vaccine as the risk for severe illness with COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk.

## Pandemic lockdown led to a cleaner, not just clearer, Lagoon of Venice - Less than two months after COVID-19 restrictions, it experienced a 40% decrease in identifiable pollutants known as volatile organic compounds, primarily from plastics, water traffic and tourism.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/pandemic-lockdown-led-to-a-cleaner-not-just-clearer-lagoon-of-venice/):

> "The lockdown provided a unique opportunity for comparing what was the quality of the water in Venice before the lockdown and after the lockdown," said Teresa Cecchi, a chemistry instructor at ITT Montani and the sole author of the study. The findings stress Venice's shortcomings in managing overtourism and waste and how they impact the surrounding waters, according to Davide Poletto, a project officer at the Venice bureau of UNESCO. Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means they are designated for conservation for their cultural importance. The study, "Analysis of volatiles organic compounds in Venice lagoon water reveals COVID 19 lockdown impact on microplastics and mass tourism related pollutants," published April 7 in Science of the Total Environment, was authored by Teresa Cecchi, ITT Montani.

## Dogs forming eye contact is important in dog–human communication. Mutual gaze plays a role in dog–human bonding, and is associated with increased oxytocin levels in dogs and human partners. A new study found that shorter headed dogs, mongrels, younger, and more playful dogs form eye contact faster.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88702-w):

> The cephalic index is positively correlated with dogs' propensity to make eye contact with a human, so that shorter headed dogs would form eye contact faster. A Tukey post-hoc test showed that cooperative breeds were more prone to establish eye contact more quickly with the experimenter than non-cooperative breeds with a hazard ratio of 2.965, Z = 3.64, p < 0.001). Mixed breed dogs were also more inclined to form eye contact earlier than non-cooperative breeds with a hazard ratio of 2.935, Z = 3.95, p < 0.001), while we found no difference between cooperative breeds and mixed breed dogs, Z = 0.04, p = 0.999. After 15 s elapsed, usually ~ 90% of cooperative breeds and mixed breed dogs have already formed eye contact with the experimenter, while at the same time only ~ 75% of non-cooperative breeds had. Age had a significant negative effect on latency to form eye contact with a hazard ratio of 0.986, Z =  − 5.27, p < 0.001; Fig.

## Paintings by female artists on average sell for 42.1% less than the average price for paintings by men. The price disparity for paintings by women was greater in countries with higher gender inequality compared to countries with lower gender inequality.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/female-artists-are-underrepresented-in-the-art-world-and-their-paintings-fetch-significantly-less-at-auctions/):

> Paintings b.y female artists on average sell for 42.1% less than the average price for paintings by men, according to a new study that is the first to focus on prices as a measure of inequality in the art world. Since female artists fetch lower prices at auctions generally, and because this is exacerbated in countries with higher gender inequality, auction prices of paintings are acting as a function of culture - a function that is biased against female artists. In the second experiment, respondents were again asked to rate how much they liked 10 paintings on a 0-10 scale, but this time respondents were shown random paintings by an artificial system based on a deep neural network that creates high-quality artistic images.

`/u/bodangren2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n3g2va/paintings_by_female_artists_on_average_sell_for/):

> Why use mean and not median? We know that there are quite a few outliers with fantastic valuation. Most of those outliers are male from last century or before, I'd guess. Controlling for size also seems strange and irrelevant.

## Men’s loneliness linked to an increased risk of cancer, finds a new study of 2,570 middle-aged men from Finland. In addition, cancer mortality was higher in cancer patients who were unmarried, widowed or divorced at baseline.

Summary of [original article](https://www.uef.fi/en/article/mens-loneliness-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-cancer):

> A recent study by the University of Eastern Finland shows that loneliness among middle-aged men is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Loneliness increased the risk of cancer by about ten per cent. "Awareness of the health effects of loneliness is constantly increasing. Therefore, it is important to examine, in more detail, the mechanisms by which loneliness causes adverse health effects. This information would enable us to better alleviate loneliness and the harm caused by it, as well as to find optimal ways to target preventive measures."

> Not surprising, at least for the mortality aspect. When we spend our days with others, they notice changes in our physical state more keenly than we monitor our own health. They prompt us to *go get that checked* and follow up with us until we do.

## No echo in the chambers of political interactions on Reddit

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81531-x):

> Echo chambers in online social networks, whereby users' beliefs are reinforced by interactions with like-minded peers and insulation from others' points of view, have been decried as a cause of political polarization. Given the two-party nature of the US political system and the polarized state of its political discourse, we approach the problem by modeling the interactions between groups of users labeled by their political leaning-specifically, according to which candidate they support in the 2016 presidential elections. Political interactions on Reddit can be further characterized in terms of the score assigned to each comment or submission, and the activity of users, i.e., their propensity to engage in interactions with other peers.

## The personality trait of “realness,” or the tendency to behave in a way one feels on the inside without regard for personal or social consequences, is a more central part of personality than previously thought — and one that has clear implications for healthy psychological functioning.

## The First Australians grew to a population of millions, much more than previous estimates. The establishment of populations in every part of this giant continent could have occurred in as little as 5,000 years. And the entire population of Sahul could have been as high as 6.4 million people.

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/the-first-australians-grew-to-a-population-of-millions-much-more-than-previous-estimates-142371):

> This translates to more than 3 million people in the area that is now modern-day Australia, far more than any previous estimate. Estimates vary from 300,000 to more than 1,200,000 people. Population estimates immediately following European invasion are also likely to be low because of the heavy death rates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffered from exposure to European diseases such as smallpox, and the devastating history of genocide committed by colonists.
