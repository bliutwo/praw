## How Delta came to dominate the pandemic. Current vaccines were found to be profoundly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, however vaccinated individuals infected with Delta were transmitting the virus to others at greater levels than previous variants.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/spread-of-delta-sars-cov-2-variant-driven-by-combination-of-immune-escape-and-increased-infectivity):

> The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has become the dominant variant in countries including India and the UK, has most likely spread through its ability to evade neutralising antibodies and its increased infectivity, say an international team of researchers. The team found that the Delta variant virus was 5.7-fold less sensitive to the sera from previously-infected individuals, and as much as eight-fold less sensitive to vaccine sera, compared with the Alpha variant - in other words, it takes eight times as many antibodies from a vaccinated individual to block the virus. Dr Partha Rakshit from the National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi, India, joint senior author, said: "The Delta variant has spread widely to become the dominant variants worldwide because it is faster to spread and better at infecting individuals than most other variants we've seen. It is also better at getting around existing immunity - either through previous exposure to the virus or to vaccination - though the risk of moderate to severe disease is reduced in such cases."

## To limit warming to 1.5°C, huge amounts of fossil fuels need to go unused: Nearly 60 percent of oil, 90 percent of coal should stay in the ground.

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/to-limit-warming-to-1-5oc-huge-amounts-of-fossil-fuels-need-to-go-unused/):

> A massive amount of fossil fuels will need to stay in the ground if the world is to reach its goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5ºC, a new study shows. The earlier work used modeling to suggest that, globally, one-third of all oil reserves, half of gas reserves, and more than 80 percent of coal reserves need to remain unused to reach the goal. According to the new research, nearly 60 percent of existing oil and fossil methane gas and 90 percent of global coal reserves need to go unused through at least 2050-and this action would only yield a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to 1.5ºC. These reductions mean that many fossil fuel projects around the world, both planned and existing, would need to be halted.

## In an analysis of nearly 16,000 young people who required medical care after encounters with law enforcement in the state between 2005 and 2017, Black teens age 15 to 19 had a more than three-fold higher risk for injury than White youths of the same age

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/09/07/injuries-law-enforcement-racial-disparities-study/8841631024894/?u3L=1):

> In the analysis of nearly 16,000 young people who required medical care after encounters with law enforcement in the state between 2005 and 2017, Black teens age 15 to 19 had a more than three-fold higher risk for injury than White youths of the same age, the data showed. Black males ages 15 to 19 were 3.5 times as likely as White males in that age group to require treatment for injuries after encounters with law enforcement, while Black females had a four-fold higher injury rate than White females. Black males ages 10 to 14 had a more than five times higher rate of injury than White males those ages, while Black females in that age group had a nearly seven-fold higher injury rate.

> This article makes exactly no mention for the nature of the interaction - is the headline statistic controlling for this at all? Given no mention at all, it's safe for the reader to just infer that black teens are simply more likely to commit violent crimes because of average lower socioeconomic factors, or some other variables that have nothing to do with race.

> You need to control for the other differences between your statistical populations you're comparing.

## MIT-designed project achieves major advance toward fusion energy

Summary of [original article](https://news.mit.edu/2021/MIT-CFS-major-advance-toward-fusion-energy-0908):

> With the magnet technology now successfully demonstrated, the MIT-CFS collaboration is on track to build the world's first fusion device that can create and confine a plasma that produces more energy than it consumes. "The challenges of making fusion happen are both technical and scientific," says Dennis Whyte, director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which is working with CFS to develop SPARC. But once the technology is proven, he says, "It's an inexhaustible, carbon-free source of energy that you can deploy anywhere and at any time. It's really a fundamentally new energy source." The papers showed that, if the magnets worked as expected, the whole fusion system should indeed produce net power output, for the first time in decades of fusion research.

`/u/DrElectrons` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/pkauy2/mitdesigned_project_achieves_major_advance_toward/):

> We need to triple the funding for fusion at this point. It would be very little, but would help move it along faster.

## Misophonia Might Not Be about Hating Sounds After All: The phenomenon triggers strong negative reactions to everyday sounds but might come from subconscious mirroring behaviour
