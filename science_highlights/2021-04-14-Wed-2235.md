## States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, finds a new study of the 50 US states. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. (PLOS One, 14 Apr 2021)

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249891):

> This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Because stay-at-home order, mask wearing policy, mask adherence, and COVID-19 rates can vary from month to month, we listed those states with consistent classifications across the period April through September. Because high COVID rates were reported by only eight states in May and four states in June, we did not examine mask adherence or policy in the preceding April or May. Thus, subsequent comparisons of states with high COVID-19 rates by month focused on July, August, September and October.

> While I’m pro-mask, I wonder whether you can get more from this study other than correlation between mask adherence and lower COVID rates.  Higher mask adherence likely correlates with other COVID-risk mitigation efforts, like adhering to social distancing rules and quarantines. It seems like it would be hard to separate those factors to determine it actually causes the lower rates and not some other factor.

## New longitudinal research has been shown that sleep is even more important from ages 14-21 than previously understood. It has also been noted than sleep deprivation is one of the main catalysts for exacerbation of mental illnesses.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210305-why-teenage-sleep-is-so-important-for-mental-health):

> The complex relationship between sleep and mental health is further reinforced by the finding that if you treat depression, the problems with sleep don't all disappear. You're distressed so you can't sleep; you can't sleep so you are more distressed - and so on, and so on, in an escalating cycle. What is already clear, from a meta-analysis of 49 studies, is that tackling poor sleep among those with insomnia, who are already experiencing symptoms of depression, not only helps them sleep better but also reduces the depression.

## Psilocybin, the active chemical in “magic mushrooms”, has antidepressant-like actions, at least in mice, even when the psychedelic experience is blocked. This could loosen its restrictions and have the fast-acting antidepressant benefit delivered without requiring daylong guided sessions.

Summary of [original article](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2021/UM-School-of-Medicine-Study-Shows-that-Psychedelic-Experience-May-Not-be-Required-for-Psilocybins-Antidepressant-like-Benefits.html):

> University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers have shown that psilocybin-the active chemical in "Magic mushrooms"- still works its antidepressant-like actions, at least in mice, even when the psychedelic experience is blocked. "We do not understand the mechanisms that underlie the antidepressant actions of psilocybin and the role that the profound psychedelic experience during these sessions plays in the therapeutic benefits," says Scott Thompson, Ph.D., Professor and Chair, Department of Physiology at UMSOM and senior author of the study. "These findings show that activation of the receptor causing the psychedelic effect isn't absolutely required for the antidepressant benefits, at least in mice," says Dr. Thompson, "But the same experiment needs to be performed in depressed human subjects." He says his team plans to investigate which of the 13 other serotonin receptors are the ones responsible for the antidepressant actions.

> If you could get people the physical benefits of psychoplastogens without the trip, that would permanently alter the field of psychiatry as we know it.

## Chronic work stress can change our personalities: Employees dealing with work-induced stress can experience changes to their physiology, based on genetics and epigenetics, which may result in their personality traits fluctuating or even fundamentally changing over time.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/chronic-work-stress-can-change-our-personalities/):

> In their paper introducing the model, published March 16 in the Journal of Management, the researchers explain that work can be a powerful driver of personality change. Over time, the load on these systems from chronic stress appraisals alters the epigenome, which contains a record of all chemical changes made to DNA. Those changes to the epigenome can in turn cause changes to system functioning and to long-term personality traits. "The exciting part of this is that this genetic expression, which provides the stability for your personality traits, also is the mechanism by which those traits can change over the course of your life - when you move from one stage of life to another or when you change environments," said Smallfield.

## New study has found that granddaughters whose grandmothers were exposed to the pesticide DDT have higher rates of obesity and earlier first menstrual periods. This may increase the granddaughters' risk for breast cancer as well as high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases.

## People Who Identify With Humanity As A Whole Are More Likely To Say They’d Follow Pandemic Guidelines And Help Others

Summary of [original article](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/14/people-who-identify-with-humanity-as-a-whole-are-more-likely-to-say-theyd-follow-pandemic-guidelines-and-help-others/):

> First, they were asked how likely they were to comply with the health behaviours recommended by the World Health Organization at the start of 2020, when the pandemic begun to spread across the world. Those who identified more strongly with all of humanity were significantly more likely to say they'd engage both in prosocial behaviours, such as donating masks and going grocery shopping for others, and in the WHO health behaviours designed to stop the spread of the virus. The results are positive news for those who reject nationalism - participants who identified more closely both with their own community and humanity as a whole were more likely to engage in prosocial and health behaviours than those who strongly identified with their nation alone.

## US Energy transition to renewables likely to accelerate over next two to three years - Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis

Summary of [original article](https://ieefa.org/ieefa-u-s-energy-transition-to-renewables-likely-to-accelerate-over-next-two-to-three-years/):

> March 31, 2021 - The speed and scope of the energy transition to renewables will pick up pace over the next two to three years, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis' U.S. Power Sector Outlook 2021. "The Texas transition will not be replicated precisely in other areas of the country, but the broad themes are certainly going to hold true, particularly the surge in new wind and solar generation through 2024," said Seth Feaster, an IEEFA energy data analyst and Outlook co-author. The Institute's mission is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy.

`/u/trowe2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/mr2dv6/us_energy_transition_to_renewables_likely_to/):

> Negative. Wind and solar provide no inertial stabilization to the interconnection. Without spinning mass, no frequency or var support, we will reach an installed peak in the next 5-10 years followed by a leveling out. We need a baseload technology that replaces gas and coal to act as a low emission companion to nuclear power if we are going to continue to utilize in place transmission infrastructure.  Unfortunately there are 0 research dollars for such a technology.

> Al tough there is no significant difference this was expected due to the small sample. If you look closer in the article, especially the appendixes you can see that psilocybin outperformed Escitalopram (SSRI for depression) on all measures. It’s a shame that the journal didn’t highlight that it’s equally good and also even slightly better (but not significant based om this cutoff points, small sample and effect size etc.).
