## Lung damage found in COVID dead may shed light on 'long COVID' - A study of the lungs of people who have died from COVID-19 has found persistent and extensive lung damage in most cases. COVID-19 is a unique disease characterized by extensive lung thrombosis (blood clotting).

> >Methods: Here we report the systematic analysis of 41 consecutive post-mortem samples from individuals who died of COVID-19.
> 
> So all the samples are deaths of COVID. While this is an interesting study, one has to be careful deducting conclusions for COVID in the general population. Still, it is likely that severe COVID patients that survived will show some form of this lung damage.

## The more combat experiences that veterans endure, the less hawkish their foreign policy positions are: New study provides evidence that, among those who express regret about their time in the military, veterans with more combat experiences tend to have more dovish foreign policy views

## New evidence of an illusory 'suffering-reward' association: People mistakenly expect suffering will lead to fortuitous rewards, an irrational 'just-world' belief that undue suffering deserves to be compensated to help restore balance.

> I'd wager this association forms the basis for most religions and has been used to great effect by rulers throughout history.

## Scientists have discovered that the platypus is biofluorescent. The three specimens in the study appeared brown under visible light and green or cyan under UV light, due to fluoresced wavelengths that peaked around 500 nm. This is the first report of biofluorescence in a monotreme mammal.

Summary of [original article](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/mamm/ahead-of-print/article-10.1515-mammalia-2020-0027/article-10.1515-mammalia-2020-0027.xml):

> A male platypus museum specimen collected from Tasmania, Australia, photographed under visible light and 385-395 nm ultraviolet light without and with a yellow camera lens filter. While biofluorescence in response to UV light was seen in all of the platypus specimens we examined, the small sample size limits our ability to draw conclusions about the ecological function of this trait. This new observation of biofluorescence in the platypus under UV light strengthens the hypothesis that the trait is adaptive in low-light environments.

> So what they are saying is Perry the Platypus was colored correctly.

## Wearing masks throughout the period of exposure to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with lower risk for infection, but wearing masks only sometimes during the period was not. This evidence supports recommendations to wear masks consistently and correctly at all times in public.

Summary of [original article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-3003_article):

> We defined primary index patients as persons whose probable sources of infection were before the study period, March 1-31; for whom we were not able to identify the source of infection; or whose probable sources of infection were outside the contact tracing data included in the study. Because our study focused on the risk for infection in the community, we excluded contacts whose contact locations were healthcare facilities. We found a negative association between risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and maintaining a distance of >1 m from a COVID-19 patient; duration of contact <15 minutes; handwashing often; and wearing a mask all the time during contact with a COVID-19 patient.

`/u/pdxchris` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jntds1/wearing_masks_throughout_the_period_of_exposure/):

> > We found the type of mask worn was not independently associated with infection and that contacts who always wore masks were more likely to practice social distancing. 
> 
> So was it the mask or social distancing that mattered the most?
