## Scientists examined hundreds of Kentucky residents who had been sick with COVID-19 through June of 2021 and found that unvaccinated people had a 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared to those who were fully vaccinated.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0806-vaccination-protection.html):

> In today's MMWR, a study of COVID-19 infections in Kentucky among people who were previously infected with SAR-CoV-2 shows that unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus. These data further indicate that COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity alone and that vaccines, even after prior infection, help prevent reinfections. The findings suggest that among people who have had COVID-19 previously, getting fully vaccinated provides additional protection against reinfection.

## New Study Reveals Covid Vaccine Does Not Cause Female Sterility

Summary of [original article](https://www.asrm.org/news-and-publications/news-and-research/press-releases-and-bulletins/new-study-reveals-covid-vaccine-does-not-cause-female-sterility/):

> In a recent study published in ASRM's Fertility & Sterility F&S Reports, Randy Morris, M.D. used frozen embryo transfer as a model for comparing the implantation rates between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine seropositive, infection seropositive, and seronegative women. This study is critical because vaccine hesitancy in reproductive-aged women is concerning and has resulted from the spread of misinformation on social media stating that COVID-19 vaccines will cause sterility in women. "We hope that all reproductive-aged women will be more confident getting the COVID-19 vaccine, given Dr. Morris's findings that the vaccine does not cause female sterility," said Hugh Taylor, M.D., president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

`/u/SigmaB` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ozriur/new_study_reveals_covid_vaccine_does_not_cause/):

> > This study documented, for the first time in women, that seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein -- whether from vaccination or COVID infection -- does not prevent embryo implantation or early pregnancy development. Physicians and other health professionals must counsel women of reproductive age that neither previous COVID-19 illness nor antibodies produced from vaccination to COVID-19 will cause sterility.
> 
> Also "reveals" (I'd rather have chosen the word "confirms", but that's just me) that the illness doesn't cause sterility, which is good. The reason why both vaccine and illness is covered is because of the purported (emphasis on purported) similarity between syncytin-1 (a protein involved in placental development) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

## Ohio’s Vax-a-Million lottery was successful in getting more than 100,000 additional Ohioans to get in line for the COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly 3.5 million adults and 155,000 children had registered by the end of the lottery. The incentive program cost the state about $5.6 million

Summary of [original article](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(21)00466-6/fulltext):

> The difference in vaccination rates in Ohio and the synthetic control following the lottery announcement was then used to estimate the lottery's impact. Changes in vaccination rates in Ohio and synthetic Ohio following the lottery announcement can then be used as an indicator of the lottery's impact. The impact of the lottery on vaccination rates was assessed for the period from the lottery announcement date of May 13 to the final lottery enrollment date of June 20.Two sensitivity tests were performed to assess the robustness of the findings.

`/u/ToxDocUSA` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ozr5fy/ohios_vaxamillion_lottery_was_successful_in/):

> Humans are really amazing.  "Here, come get vaccinated and we will hand you $2" would fail epically, but "here, come get vaccinated and we will give you a 1/3.6 M chance at $1M" gets them 1/4 of the population to suddenly forget that it's a mind control device / unproven / whatever excuse they were using before.

## A group of medications long prescribed to treat tapeworm has inspired a compound that shows two-pronged effectiveness against COVID-19. The compound—part of a class of molecules called salicylanilides—blocks viral material from getting out of the endosome, and it just gets degraded.

Summary of [original article](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2021/20210806-janda-potential-covid19-drug-tapeworm-medications.html):

> The compound, part of a class of molecules called salicylanilides, was designed in the laboratory of Professor Kim Janda, PhD, the Ely R. Callaway, Jr. Professor of Chemistry and director of the Worm Institute for Research and Medicine at Scripps Research, in La Jolla, CA. "It has been known for 10 or 15 years that salicylanilides work against certain viruses," Janda says. About 80 percent of salicylanilide 11 passed into the bloodstream, compared to about 10 percent of the antiparasitic drug niclosamide, which has recently entered clinical trials as a COVID-19 treatment, Janda says. "Salicylanilide 11 actually was placed on the back burner in my laboratory against C. difficile because it's not as gut-restricted as we would like it to be," Janda says.

> Would have thought the commute savings would offset the energy to heat ans light office buildings. However it does say that this is in worse possible scenarios.
> 
> In a hybrid model you would need less office space, so that would make up for it and then some.

## Vegetarian and vegan diets and risks of total and site-specific fractures: results from the prospective EPIC-Oxford study. Non-meat eaters, especially vegans, had higher risks of either total or some site-specific fractures, particularly hip fractures.

Summary of [original article](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01815-3):

> In stratified analyses of total and hip fractures, a significantly higher risk of both total and hip fractures was only observed in vegetarians over age 50 at recruitment, although vegans had higher risks in both age groups, and a significant p for interaction was only observed for total fractures. The only other studies which reported on risks of fractures by diet groups were one small prospective study in Vietnam of 210 women which found no significant difference in fracture incidence between vegans and omnivores over 2 years , and one prospective study in India which reported a higher crude rate of stress fractures among 2131 vegetarian than 6439 non-vegetarian army recruits. Separately, previous findings from the Adventist Health Study 2, which has a large proportion of vegetarians, showed that participants who ate meat more than three times a week had lower risks of hip fractures than participants who ate meat less than once a week , while combined analyses of peri- and postmenopausal women from Adventist Health Study 1 and 2 found that participants who ate meat more than four times a week had lower risks of wrist fractures than participants who never ate meat , but these results cannot be used to infer risks in fish eaters, vegetarians, or vegans as separate diet groups.

## A study suggests that people adjusted their music listening habits as a way of coping with the COVID-19 crisis. Survey respondents reported that they increased their music listening during the initial lockdown and that they used music to help them cope with emotional challenges during the pandemic.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/08/new-study-suggests-people-turned-to-music-to-cope-with-psychological-and-emotional-challenges-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-61643):

> Israeli survey respondents reported that they increased their music listening during the initial lockdown and that they used music to help them cope with emotional challenges during the pandemic. "We know from research conducted in music psychology that people intuitively use music in different ways to regulate their emotional states, to cope with stress, and to feel connected to other people. My co-author and I thought it would be interesting to see whether individuals felt a change in their use of music in real-time, during and in response to the crisis." Respondents were questioned about changes in their music listening during the lockdown, including whether their music listening had increased and whether their emotional response to music had changed.
