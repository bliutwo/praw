## When men's masculinity feels threatened, they may attempt to restore it by withdrawing from relationships that could provide care and support. Not only could this harm the relationship and affect their romantic partner, but this tactic may not restore masculinity in the eyes of others.

> I think this study is false in a few ways. Isolating is common behavior for people that feel they’ve been attacked. Not to mention their argument could more easily be summed up as “some men aren’t good at handling rage.” This has been proven and most men will openly admit it.

## Children’s ability to detect emotions appears to be minimally impacted by masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/childrens-ability-to-detect-emotions-appears-to-be-minimally-impacted-by-masks-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-58957):

> Children's ability to discern emotions from faces does not appear to be dramatically impaired by mask wearing, according to new research published in PLOS One. Children's accuracy with faces that wore masks did not significantly differ from their accuracy with faces that wore sunglasses. "When you are trying to convey emotions to children while wearing a mask, label how you are feeling, gesture, and use your voice. Children can use these cues to infer how you are feeling," Ruba said.

> What about adult children? Because I have every man-baby within 50 clicks saying they can't tell if someone is smiling through a mask.

## Men in the military who were randomly assigned to mixed-gender squads for eight weeks developed more egalitarian attitudes than those assigned to male squads. Contrary to some predictions, the integration of women into squads did not reduce male recruits' performance. [Experimental data from Norway]

## People high in trait machiavellianism are more likely to climb the corporate ladder by leaving lasting impressions with influential people in leadership positions, mostly through an ability to capitalize on social situations and expand their networks.

> The "machiavellianism" trait described in the article is essentially "being a schemer." If you're a schemer, you use your charm and networking skills to impress the higher-ups. 
> 
> Not very surprising. Note the article doesn't imply that there are no other ways to be successful at work - just that this is how schemers wind up being successful.

## Violent video games do not appear to be linked to aggression, finds new meta-analysis. There may be a stronger relationship with desensitization. Games are now more important than ever for socialization, feeling autonomy and control during an uncertain time, and just de-stressing.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/2020-sept-violent-video-games.html):

> Many hours of extra screen time may have worried parents, especially in light of a highly publicized 2015 report by the American Psychological Association linking violent video games with aggressive behavior in children. A recent reanalysis of these findings published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science came to a very different conclusion, finding no clear link between video game violence and aggression in children. Additional research on the potential connection between video games and violent behavior is featured in the APS Research Topic Video Games and Violence.

`/u/musclenugget92` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/knc91q/violent_video_games_do_not_appear_to_be_linked_to/):

> Games and sports have always been a marker of civilization. I'm not sure why digital media went through a stigmatized period as there are clearly strategic and skill requirements associated with many games (like popular ancient games such as chess and shigo*)
> 
> I'm glad that "gaming" is being more recognized as a popular medium of entertainment

## Regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants has been associated with the development of food allergies by scientists from the United Kingdom. Their findings provide new insight on this important public health problem.

Summary of [original article](https://www.immunofrontiers.com/regular-moisturizer-use-on-infant-skin-associated-with-food-allergy-onset):

> A new study by researchers from St. George's, University of London, supports the "Notion that regular application" of moisturizers to young infants' skin could contribute to the onset of food allergies later in life through a process known as transcutaneous sensitization. Based on their analysis of data from the EAT study, the scientists noted a "Statistically significant dose-response relationship" between food allergy development and "Parent-reported moisturization frequency at 3 months of age," such that "Each additional moisturization per week was associated with an ORadj 1.20(95% CI 1.13-591.27), p<0.0005 for developing food allergy." The scientists concluded that "These findings support the notion that regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants may promote the development of food allergy through transcutaneous sensitization" and that "Frequent skin moisturization in early life might promote the development of food allergy, most likely through transcutaneous sensitization."

> Atopy is atopy.

> Newborns needing moisturizers on skin have an atopic nature and the application of moisturizer isn't causative, it just correlates.
