## New study finds that not knowing how to flirt is the main reason behind "involuntary singlehood"; this factor was followed by not knowing how to perceive signals of interest, a lack of effort, and an overly high level of choosiness.

## Birth order (whether you’re eldest, middle or youngest) appears to impact personality development in Western countries from past research, but a new study in a non-Western country (Indonesia) found no impacts, suggesting the effect may be cultural or linked to the difference in size of families.

## Study suggests wearing a face mask during intense exercise is safe for healthy people

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/elf-ssw030421.php):

> Wearing a protective face mask has only a modest effect on the ability of healthy people to do vigorous exercise, according to a study published today in the European Respiratory Journal. Dr Salvioni said: "We know that the main route of transmission for coronavirus is via droplets in the breath and it's possible that breathing harder during exercise could facilitate transmission, especially indoors. Research suggests that wearing a mask may help prevent the spread of the disease, but there is no clear evidence on whether masks are safe to wear during vigorous exercise." Each person took part in three rounds of exercise tests: once while not wearing a face mask, once wearing a surgical mask and once wearing a 'filtering face piece 2' or FFP2 mask.

## People with higher incomes tend to feel prouder, more confident and less afraid, but not necessarily more compassionate or loving, finds a new study from 162 countries (n=1.6m). “Greater wealth may not contribute to building a more caring and tolerant society.”

## Artificial sweeteners may play role in spread of antibiotic resistance. Four commonly used artificial sweeteners – saccharine, sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium — can promote the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, according to new research.

> bacteria do transfer genes more when they are stressed, and this indicates that metabolic stress (lack of energy when it was expected) encourages the cells to transmit genes associated with survival.
> 
> It would be interesting indeed if it turns out that trafficked genes are tagged or identified in some way as occurring/useful in stressful situations so that future stresses cause these trafficked genes to be preferentially moved about. In other words not all genes are equal. Bacteria have a means to mutate their genes when their metabolism is impaired, so that they can literally engineer a solution, i.e, an enzyme that can help metabolise a different chemical or maybe a gene that helps reduce a toxin, as in antibiotic. Then they can spread this solution to each other. I've wondered if the bacteria flags up these stress related genes as important 'patches' to their genetic code, because even when antibiotics are removed from their environment they keep these genes persistently, even though they are costly to maintain if they are no longer needed.
> 
> It would make sense too that bacteria that solve their metabolic bottlenecks this way would have more energy and hence should be able to make more genes for horizontal transfer, so this would mean that it makes sense for bacteria to trust new genes produced by neighbouring bacteria, as they must be doing something right to makes those genes, and the recipient bacteria can't do anything anyhow so might as well take the risk it isn't a virus.
> 
> In the case of antibiotic resistant genes some kind of tagging may also cause them to persist (no idea what that is) but I think it could be that we feed antibiotics continuously to bacteria in farm animals, and animal manure releases large amounts of bacteria to the air as it dries, so that these bacteria may be preferentially signalling these 'stress' genes and other bacteria gladly accept these. The constant but very low level contamination of our environment with agriculturally derived, air-born antibiotic exposed bacteria may be resulting in a high transmission rate of resistant genes which are replicated and trafficked preferentially by non-exposed bacterial colonies, especially when they are stressed (by anything affecting their metabolism, as in the above case with low energy sugar substitutes).
> 
> The bacteria of animal guts also happily live in soils so this may be why antibiotic resistant genes are so persistent.
> 
> Kind of interesting that molecules of aspartame appear to be sugar to bacteria just like our taste buds.

## Study finds that people who demonstrate compulsive internet use score higher in psychopathy, narcissism and machiavellianism

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/03/dark-personality-traits-linked-to-compulsive-and-aggressive-online-behaviors-59924):

> Using correlation analyses, the researchers found that certain online behaviors were indeed linked to Dark Triad traits. "I think a central message that can be taken away from the study is that dark personality traits are very complex constructs which operate in an even more complex online environment. In order to disentangle this intricate relationship, we looked at relevant online communication behaviors such as social-media self-presentation, media trust, and compulsive internet behavior and how they correlate with narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism," Petit told PsyPost. "Some important questions still need to be addressed. For instance: How do popular and relevant online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit discourage or promote the expression of Dark Triad traits? How can we guarantee continued and informed theory-building on the effect of Dark Triad traits on online communication behavior? What are important practical implications that might emerge out of this field of research?".
