## Voyager Probes Spot Previously Unknown Phenomenon in Deep Space. “Foreshocks” of accelerated electrons up to 30 days before a solar flare shockwave makes it to the probes, which now cruise the interstellar medium.

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/voyager-probes-spot-previously-unknown-phenomenon-in-de-1845793983):

> As the new paper describes, these shock waves are facilitating a previously unseen behavior in the interstellar medium, namely bursts of electrons appearing far ahead of the advancing shock waves. "We detected the electron bursts when the shock waves first touched the magnetic field lines running through the Voyager spacecraft-and that's the mechanism. The shock wave just touches the magnetic field line, and there's a jump at the shock, which reflects and energizes a few of the cosmic ray electrons." "More data will be needed to better understand these results," he said, including more data from Voyager 2, "Which hasn't been in the interstellar medium for long," as well as NASA's upcoming IMAP mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2024.The new paper could improve our understanding of the complex interactions between shock waves and cosmic radiation, not just in the outskirts of our neighborhood but around other stars as well, including exploding stars.

## Employees who take charge relatively more in their teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders. However, such employees are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12423):

> We study employee taking charge behavior in a team context and investigate how it influences social consequences in work teams. Drawing on the person perception perspective and the warmth-competence framework, we develop a theoretical model outlining how coworkers view and react to those team members who take charge more at work. Using a three?wave, multisource study with a round?robin design, we find that members who take charge relatively more in their work teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders; however, they are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

## A smile, which brings up the corners of the mouth and creates crow's feet around the eyes, can reduce the pain of a needle injection by up to 40%, and also blunt a stressful needle-related physiological response by lowering the heart rate

Summary of [original article](https://news.uci.edu/2020/12/01/smiling-sincerely-or-grimacing-can-significantly-reduce-the-pain-of-needle-injection/):

> While no one looks forward to a vaccination, a study led by the University of California, Irvine, has found that either a sincere smile or a grimace can reduce the pain of a needle injection by as much as 40 percent. Those in the Duchenne smile and grimace groups reported that the injection hurt only about half as much as those in the neutral group, indicating that these actions can make a positive difference in the needle stab experience. "Given the numerous anxiety- and pain-provoking situations found in medical practice, we hope that an understanding of how and when smiling and grimacing helps will foster effective pain reduction strategies that result in better patient experiences."

`/u/vbwrg` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k77o44/a_smile_which_brings_up_the_corners_of_the_mouth/):

> A grimace had the same effect as a "genuine smile".  But a non-genuine smile did not.
> 
> The grimace may be more useful.  Getting patients to give a "genuine" rather than fake smile may be difficult when they're facing a needle ("No! I need your smile to have crow's feet!  Do you want this shot or not?!")  Getting them to grimace might be easier.
> 
> Of course that's not as feel-good as "smiles kill pain!"  But that's OK with me.  *Grimace*.

## To decarbonize economy, researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "electrify" economic sectors with wind & solar energy. In some years, we will have to install more than a 100 GW of solar PV and wind power, and to achieve full decarbonization, CO2 prices will have to be a lot higher than today.

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2020/12/04/Early-steady-investment-in-wind-solar-best-way-to-decarbonize-economy/2951607090283/):

> Dec. 4 - To decarbonize the economy, European researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "Electrify" economic sectors with wind and solar energy. Even the early and steady strategy will require periods of aggressive - rapid, even - installation and adoption of wind and solar energy. Even as more and more wind and solar power sources are brought online, the energy system will still need to rely on gas power during so-called "Nightmare weeks" when frigid temperatures trigger peaks in energy demands.

> The department I worked in at my former employer is going to 9 day weeks with just a 40¢/hr increase on weekends, that’s in addition to increasing the workload of their current workforce by arguably more than 2X while tying their evaluations (and therefor pay) to impossible metrics. I put on about 100lbs working there and didn’t start to lose it until I emotionally divorced myself from the position and devised an exit strategy. I’m currently unemployed and burning through my savings and I still feel less stress on a daily basis now that I’m gone even though my future has never been less certain in nearly 40 years. If the amount of damage to people that the working environment I came from can be objectively measured and companies be penalized for fostering those kinds of environments, this would be excellent news indeed. Even if such an index could be published as a warning to potential employees we’d be doing something.

I’ll just say that if a place has upwards of 500 locations there’s a serious chance they’re doing *some*thing heinous enough to make you queasy if you heard about it. Plus if you’re not in the Mid-Atlantic there’s a really good chance you don’t have to worry about this one anyway. And maybe stick to Mom and Pops for your gas and grocery just to be safe. Also thanks for the general support.

## blood type may play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Study finds slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types & the risk of death was increased for type AB & decreased for types A & B. Rh-negative blood type have a protective effect for infection, intubation & death outcomes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19623-x?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=organic&utm_campaign=NGMT_USG_JC01_GL_NRJournals):

> Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimate Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. The numerous associations between conditions and both blood type and COVID-19 provide reason to believe that true associations may exist between blood type and morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Type A had lower risk of intubation and death compared with types AB and O. Only type B had inconsistent effects between intubation and death-type B increased risk of intubation and decreased risk of death compared to type O. We also found consistent evidence for protective associations between Rh-negative blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 infection, intubation, death.

## CRISPR and another genetic strategy fix cell defects in two common blooddisorders

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/crispr-and-another-genetic-strategy-fix-cell-defects-two-common-blooddisorders):

> It is a double milestone: new evidence that cures are possible for many people born with sickle cell disease and another serious blood disorder, beta-thalassemia, and a first for the genome editor CRISPR. In today's issue of and tomorrow at the American Society of Hematology meeting, teams report that two strategies for directly fixing malfunctioning blood cells have dramatically improved the health of a handful of people with these genetic diseases. "This is an amazing time, and it's exciting because it's happening all at once," says hematologist Alexis Thompson of Northwestern University, who with a company called Bluebird Bio continues to test yet another genetic strategy that first demonstrated a sickle cell fix several years ago. People born with sickle cell disease have mutations in their two copies of a gene for hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells.
