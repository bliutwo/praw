> Is it only 45% reduction because they are mostly using regular mask/medical mask?

> I remember seeing a Japanese study say that those masks were about 50% effective vs the n95 being over 90% effective. If there were enough n95 would the reduction be closer to 80 or 85%?

## 2020 is a 'preview' of how bad things can get if we don't fix climate change, other systemic problems: Lancet report | In 2018 in the U.S. alone, pollution caused more than 68,000 people to die prematurely.

> Vibrio bacteria, which lives off Northeast shores and can cause gastrointestinial distress, skin infections and sometimes death, has increased as climate change has warmed waters and created more ideal salinity for its growth, the report said. According to The Lancet report, where people live and how much money they have directly effects their capacity to resist threats to their health from climate change. "In the US, we see clear evidence of how certain communities are more burdened by pre-existing inequities," Dr. Jeremy Hess, author on both the global report and the U.S. breakout, said in a written statement.

It was launched following the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, which concluded that unmitigated climate change would undermine 50 years of public health gains, but that responding to climate change could represent “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century.”

One intended audience for the brief is U.S. policymakers, so it includes a list of policy recommendations that aim to protect human health from the climate crisis. The brief is developed in partnership with the American Public Health Association and a working group of experts in the climate and health field.

## Youth who develop higher levels of conscientiousness and emotional stability achieve greater success as young adults, with better income and career satisfaction. The study shows that teens are not just stuck with their personality traits, and positive change can have a big impact on their careers.

Summary of [original article](https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2020/december-2020/12022020-hoff-personality-maturity-career.php):

> Data analysis of a 12-year longitudinal study examining the importance of personality changes during young adulthood indicates personality growth has real-world career benefits. Hoff's study is the first to assess the predictive power of personality changes for a broad range of career outcomes across more than a decade of young adulthood. Specifically, conscientiousness changes predicted career satisfaction; emotional stability changes were tied closely to income and career satisfaction; and extraversion changes were linked to career and job satisfaction.

## Scientists invent technology that can extract oxygen and fuel from Mars’ salty water in huge step forward to colonising Red Planet

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-extract-oxygen-fuel-mars-salty-water-b1765034.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1606981800):

> Humankind's quest to set up base on Mars has received a boost as scientists have now claimed to have discovered a way that can help extract oxygen and fuel from the salty water found on the red planet. "Our Martian brine electrolyser radically changes the logistical calculus of missions to Mars and beyond. This technology is equally useful on Earth where it opens up the oceans as a viable oxygen and fuel source," said Vijay Ramani of Washington University. It is carrying instruments that will use high-temperature electrolysis but the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment will be producing oxygen only, from the carbon dioxide in the air.1./2.Mars rover Curiosity finds evidence of ancient fast-moving streams on surface of red planet.

> 
> >**Significance:** The active Martian water cycle, i.e., the presence of a shallow water table and soluble perchlorates in the Martian regolith, enables the concurrent production of hydrogen fuel and life-support oxygen on Mars through perchlorate brine electrolysis. Our perchlorate brine electrolyzer operating under simulated Martian surface conditions produces >25× the amount of oxygen produced by the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment from NASA’s Mars 2020 mission for the same input power. This work provides an additional route to help NASA fulfill its mandate to land humans on Mars by 2033. Furthermore, our perchlorate brine electrolyzers are more efficient than state-of-the-art alkaline water electrolyzers under terrestrial conditions, providing a pathway to utilize suboptimal input feeds to produce ultrapure hydrogen and oxygen.

> >**Abstract:** NASA’s current mandate is to land humans on Mars by 2033. Here, we demonstrate an approach to produce ultrapure H2 and O2 from liquid-phase Martian regolithic brine at ∼−36 °C. Utilizing a Pb2Ru2O7−δ pyrochlore O2-evolution electrocatalyst and a Pt/C H2-evolution electrocatalyst, we demonstrate a brine electrolyzer with >25× the O2 production rate of the Mars Oxygen In Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) from NASA’s Mars 2020 mission for the same input power under Martian terrestrial conditions. Given the Phoenix lander’s observation of an active water cycle on Mars and the extensive presence of perchlorate salts that depress water’s freezing point to ∼−60 °C, our approach provides a unique pathway to life-support and fuel production for future human missions to Mars.

## Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2023184):

> Abstract BackgroundWorld Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs - remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a - in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. IntroductionIn February 2020, a World Health Organization research forum on coronavirus disease 2019 recommended evaluation of treatments in large, randomized trials,1 and other WHO expert groups identified four repurposed antiviral drugs that might have at least a moderate effect on mortality: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a.2 In March 2020, the WHO began a large, simple, international, open-label, randomized trial involving hospital inpatients to evaluate the effects of these four drugs on in-hospital mortality. Trial procedures were minimal but rigorous, with data entry through a cloud-based Good Clinical Practice-compliant clinical data management system that recorded demographic characteristics, respiratory support, coexisting illnesses, and local availability of trial drugs before generating the treatment assignment.

## A new light-based quantum computer has achieved quantum supremacy. Jiuzhang harnessed photons to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a classical computer more than 600 million years.

> Someone help me understand this please. As best I know, boson sampling is designed to work out the probability distribution for where (in this case photons) will end up after being injected into a device. This is hard to predict for a normal computer.            
> Now as far as I can make out from the article, the way they solved the problem was to actually conduct the experiment. They sent photons into an array and measured where they came out.          
> What I don't understand is how this is computing. What was simulated ?

## Risk-averse teens sway peers to make safer choices, finds new brain imaging study. Watching social peers making safe choices – positive peer pressure – may lead some teens to make safer choices than they would otherwise.

Summary of [original article](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2020/11/risk-averse-teens-can-sway-peers-to-make-safer-choices--new-stud.html):

> In a new study published Nov. 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Virginia Tech neuroscientists at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC show that observing peers making sound decisions may help young people play it safe. "Watching social peers making safe choices - positive peer pressure - may lead some teens to make safer choices than they would otherwise." Teens who had never tried illicit substances were more likely to follow their safe peers' choices, and therefore also made safer choices for themselves.
