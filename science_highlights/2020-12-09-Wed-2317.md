## Wielding a gun makes a shooter perceive others as wielding a gun, too - the “gun embodiment effect” - finds a new randomized controlled trial. Accidental shootings of unarmed victims may sometimes happen because the shooter misperceived the victim as also having a gun.

> If you read the article and not just the headline, it seems like a very small increase of mistaking a gun and actually a slower response time to making a decision. 
> 
> "They also found that holding a gun affected participants’ accuracy, with a 1% greater likelihood to misperceive the other person as having a gun too."
> 
> "The researchers found strong evidence that when holding a gun, participants were a little slower to make their judgment about whether the other person was also holding a gun."
> 
> The headline doesn't really match the article, for whatever that's worth.

## Dogs may never learn that every sound of a word matters. Despite their great hearing, dogs cannot tell the difference between words which differ in only one speech sound (dog vs dig), finds a new brain wave study. This may explain why the number of words dogs learn to recognize remains low.

## Religious discrimination particularly high for Jews and Muslims research shows. While 8.7% of all the people surveyed reported being threatened with physical violence due to their religion, threats were reported by 16.7% of Jews and 20.3% of Muslims.

Summary of [original article](https://news.rice.edu/2020/12/09/religious-discrimination-particularly-high-for-jews-and-muslims-study-shows/):

> Although people of all faiths report growing religious discrimination during the past few years, the phenomenon is most common among Jews and Muslims, according to a new study from researchers at Rice University and West Virginia University. Jews and Muslims were also more likely to report religious harassment, threats and violence. Muslims and Jews were also the most likely to report organizational discrimination.

## Human-made materials now outweigh Earth's entire biomass – study

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/human-made-materials-now-outweigh-earths-entire-biomass-study):

> Their research shows that human activity including production of concrete, metal, plastic, bricks and asphalt has brought the world to a crossover point where human-made mass - driven mostly by enhanced consumption and urban development - exceeds the overall living biomass on Earth. Anthropogenic mass is defined as the mass embedded in inanimate solid objects made by humans and does not include waste. "While modern agriculture utilises an increasing land area for growing crops, the total mass of domesticated crops is vastly outweighed by the loss of plant mass resulting from deforestation, forest management and other land-use changes. These trends in global biomass have affected the carbon cycle and human health."

## New study is the first to demonstrate that honey bees use a contagious warning signal to deter attacking hornets, that even "murder" hornets recognize, that can lead to a counter attack in which bees surrounds the hornet, forming a "heat ball" that mixes heat, CO2 and stinging against the hornet.

Summary of [original article](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/i-see-you-honey-bees-use-contagious-and-honest-visual-signal-to-deter-attacking-hornets):

> A signal from colony guard bees lets hornets know that their attack plans have been exposed, and also sends an alarm across the bee colony communicating that urgent reinforcements are needed due to the impending danger. University of California San Diego biologists studying Asian honey bees and hornets have produced new research that deconstructs this ISY signal and shows for the first time that it is visually driven and contagious across the bee colony. "The beauty of the ISY signal is that hornets are only deterred if enough defending bees quickly gather to synchronously produce the signal, thereby showing the hornet that further attack is futile," said study senior author James Nieh, a professor in the Section of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution in UC San Diego's Division of Biological Sciences.

> Is t this only in Japanese honey bees though. IIRC from the murder-hornet doc I watched years ago, European honey bees don’t have this defense mechanism
