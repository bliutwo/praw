## Psychedelics temporarily disrupt the functional organization of the brain, resulting in increased “perceptual bandwidth,” finds a new study of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying psychedelic-induced entropy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74060-6):

> In line with previous experimental findings with psychedelic drugs9, the model shows a significant increase in the brain's entropy h due to 5HT2A-R activation, with an average entropy of in the placebo condition, and in the 5HT2A-R condition, Cohen's. We propose a possible mechanism in the sense that the average increase in neural entropy induced by serotonergic psychedelic drugs can be explained in terms of quantities that provide a neurobiological interpretation about how this phenomena could occur in the brain. In this paper we have provided the first mechanistic explanation of the neural entropy increase elicited by psychedelic drugs, using a whole-brain dynamical model with 5HT2A-R neuromodulation.

## Researchers have found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, stays in breast milk for up to six weeks, further supporting the recommendations to abstain from marijuana use during pregnancy and while a mother is breastfeeding.

Summary of [original article](https://www.childrenscolorado.org/about/news/2021/march-2021/thc-breastmilk-study/):

> "With the increasing utilization of marijuana in society as a whole, we are seeing more mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy," said Children's Colorado neonatologist Erica Wymore, MD, MPH. "However, given the lack of scientific data regarding how long THC persists in breast milk, it was challenging to provide mothers with a definitive answer regarding the safety of using marijuana while breastfeeding and simply 'pumping and dumping' until THC was no longer detectable in their milk. With this study, we aimed to better understand this question by determining the amount and duration of THC excretion in breast milk among women with known prenatal marijuana use." The researchers studied women with prenatal marijuana use who delivered their infants at Children's Colorado and UCHealth's University of Colorado Hospital between November 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019. Longitudinal studies from the 1980s have shown that children born to mothers who used marijuana during pregnancy experienced long-term issues with cognitive and executive functioning, including impulsivity, as well as deficits in learning, sustained attention and visual problem-solving skills.

## Hospital patients from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to receive prompt CPR after their hearts stop beating & less likely to survive than patients from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. It is the first study to show that socioeconomic status—rather than other factors—is important.

## Executive control differences in autism spectrum disorder may be the result of a unique approach, rather than an impairment. A brain imaging study of teens and young adults found that proactive control in those with autism is not impaired, but implemented in a unique, and not efficient, way.

> This actually makes a lot of sense. Working with kids on the spectrum, many things that others do intuitively, they can do just fine if they understand it cognitively. If you explain manners, emotional regulation, executive tasks, etc. in a systemic way, many on the spectrum are entirely capable of the same things as neurotypicals. It's just that no one has taken the time to explain how.

## Latest research by Washington State University Health Sciences Spokane shows night shifts disrupt the natural 24-hour rhythms in the activity of certain cancer-related genes, making night shift workers more vulnerable to the disease.

Summary of [original article](https://resetyoureveryday.com/why-night-shift-workers-higher-risk-cancer-sleep/):

> Analyses of white blood cells taken from the participants showed that the rhythms of many of the cancer-related genes varied in the night shift condition compared to the day shift condition. Further study revealed increased DNA damage in the night shift condition indicating that they were more vulnerable to external damage from radiation, a known risk factor for DNA damage and cancer. Jason McDermott, a computational scientist, PNNL. The researchers will be exploring further by conducting the same experiment on real-world shift workers who have consistently been on day or night shifts for several years to determine whether the unrepaired DNA damage builds up over time, thereby increasing the risk of cancer.

## Researchers have found that mixed-gender research teams in economics and management received more citations for their articles than than single-gender teams and solo authors, suggesting a link between gender diversity and stronger research.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/mixed-gender-research-teams-lead-to-more-citations/):

> Two male researchers have found that mixed-gender research teams in economics and management received more citations for their articles than single-gender teams and solo authors, suggesting a link between gender diversity and stronger research. Notably, all-male teams were cited more often than all-female teams. The study, "Gender diversity in research teams and citation impact in economics and management," published Feb. 28 in the Journal of Economic Surveys, was authored by Abdelghani Maddi, Haut Conseil de l'Évaluation de la Recherche et de l'Enseignement Supérieur; and Yves Gingras, University of Quebec in Montreal.

> There could also be a sociological element here; a larger group of collaborators may already be a measure of collaboration and cross pollination within research institutions, so you might need to account for clustering in these citations, and whether that clustering can be matched to social networks.
> 
> If they are still being cited more by strangers, that might tell you something new.

## The expansion of old-age assistance in the 1935 Social Security Act reduced mortality by 30-39 percent among those older than 65 years.

Summary of [original article](https://academic.oup.com/ereh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ereh/heab001/6156845):

> This is followed by a difference-in-differences analysis to show that states that passed more generous OAA laws after 1935 had greater declines in old-age mortality and panel data with fixed effects between 1935 and 1944 that allowed us to look at thin age and race groups and observed payments per recipient along with recipiency rates. Panel data with fixed effects While our main causal results come from the event study, we also use panel data from 1936 to 1944 with state and year fixed effects to test the contemporaneous impact of OAA on elderly mortality rates and describe in more detail the age discontinuity of the program. Our descriptive work also shows that the OAA somewhat helped to reduce non-white mortality, but their impact for reducing racial inequalities was rather more limited, as whites benefited more from the OAA.Since after 1935 the US Social Security Bulletins also reported the number of recipients, as robustness, we modify the way in which the impact of OAA policy is measured, and instead of using OAA payment per recipient, we just use the recipiency rate.
