## COVID-19 found in penile tissue could contribute to erectile dysfunction, first study to demonstrate that COVID-19 can be present in the penis tissue long after men recover from the virus. The blood vessel dysfunction that results from the infection could then contribute to erectile dysfunction.

## Further evidence supports controversial claim that SARS-CoV-2 genes can integrate into our chromosomes and stick around long after the infection is over. The insertion could explain the rare finding that people can recover from COVID-19 but then test positive for SARS-CoV-2 again months later.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/further-evidence-offered-claim-genes-pandemic-coronavirus-can-integrate-human-dna?utm_campaign=NewsfromScience&utm_source=JHubbard&utm_medium=Twitter):

> SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has genes composed of RNA, and Jaenisch, Young, and co-authors contend that on rare occasions an enzyme in human cells may copy the viral sequences into DNA and slip them into our chromosomes. In their original preprint, the researchers presented test tube evidence that when human cells spiked with extra LINE-1 elements were infected with the coronavirus, DNA versions of SARS-CoV-2's sequences nestled into the cells' chromosomes. In two subsequent studies, both posted on bioRxiv, critics presented evidence that the supposed chimeras of human and viral DNA traces are routinely created by the very technique the group used to scan for them in chromosomes.

> I wonder if the retrotranscription of RNA virus genes is a common thing (at a low or tissue-specific level), not unique to SARS-CoV-2, and that the unprecedented interest in that virus has ushered in a new(ish) field of study.

## Petting therapy dogs enhances thinking skills of stressed college students. Students who were most at risk ended up having most improvements in executive functioning in the human-animal interaction condition. These results remained when we followed up six weeks later

> For college students under pressure, a dog may be the best stress fighter around.
> 
> Programs exclusively focused on petting therapy dogs improved stressed-out students' thinking and planning skills more effectively than programs that included traditional stress-management information, according to new Washington State University research.
> 
> The study was published today in the journal AERA Open, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Educational Research Association. The paper demonstrated that stressed students still exhibited these cognitive skills improvements up to six weeks after completion of the four-week-long program.
> 
> "It's a really powerful finding," said Patricia Pendry, associate professor in WSU's Department of Human Development. "Universities are doing a lot of great work trying to help students succeed academically, especially those who may be at risk due to a history of mental health issues or academic and learning issues. This study shows that traditional stress management approaches aren't as effective for this population compared with programs that focus on providing opportunities to interact with therapy dogs."
> 
> The researchers measured executive functioning in the 309 students involved in the study. Executive function is a term for the skills one needs to plan, organize, motivate, concentrate, memorize: "all the big cognitive skills that are needed to succeed in college," Pendry said.
> 
> Pendry conducted this study as a follow up to previous work, which found that petting animals for just 10 minutes had physiological impacts, reducing students' stress in the short-term.

## Experimental gene therapy cures children born without an immune system. Autologous ex vivo gene therapy with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector restored immune function in 48/50 children with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), with no complications.

## Women get criticized for their ambition and are subtly encouraged to be more “feminine” at work, a new study of workplace dynamics found, which examined the backlash effect — the idea that women face repercussions for behaving in a “masculine” way, including displaying ambition at work.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/men-get-more-constructive-criticism-at-work-and-they-get-more-upset-about-it/):

> Women get dinged for their ambition and subtly encouraged to be more "Feminine" even when they're still low-ranking at work, while men get much more upset when they're criticized, a new analysis of workplace dynamics found. Based on prior research, Ciancetta expected to find that women in leadership positions would face more criticism for displaying more agency, but she found no relationship between seniority and criticism. Notably, men reported feeling much more upset when they were criticized at work, suggesting they were far more sensitive than women.

## For the first time, scientists tracked large shark movements during hurricanes and found that tiger sharks may find the turmoil opportunistic for feeding. While some sharks flee, Tiger sharks brave the stormy seas.

Summary of [original article](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/while-some-sharks-flee-tiger-sharks-brave-stormy-seas-68759):

> In a study that appeared online April 22 in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, researchers reported that while other species retreated from the hurricanes, tiger sharks held fast. Hammerschlag and his colleagues were conducting unrelated shark monitoring projects-on how urbanization influenced the movements of nurse sharks, bull sharks, and great hammerhead sharks in Miami, and how dive tourism is affecting tiger shark movement in the Bahamas-when the storms arrived. Having already tagged the sharks with acoustic signalers and deployed acoustic telemetry arrays-devices that pinged the team whenever a tagged shark was near-the researchers found themselves well prepared to track the large sharks during the hurricanes.

## A brain computer interface (BCI) technique has allowed a paralyzed patient to write sentences on a screen simply by thinking about handwriting the letters. The study has doubled the previous record for invasive BCI-based writing speed.

Summary of [original article](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/mindwriting-technique-helps-paralyzed-patient-use-brain-activity-to-write-348720):

> While his hands stayed motionless, his brain activity fired up. This decoded T5's brain activity, assessing the aspects of the activity that most clearly defined mindwriting an "a" from a "p", for example. What the researchers concluded was that the neural activity generated by mindwriting varies more in duration than the activity generated by moving a cursor along a straight line.
