## Medicaid expansion in New York has improved the health of pregnant mothers, finds a new study, which suggests that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is an effective policy intervention to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce health disparities.

## People who lack consideration for others’ wellbeing are more prone to political radicalization, suggests a new study, which found a link between psychopathic traits, antisocial tendencies and support for group violence.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/non-clinical-psychopathic-traits-linked-to-support-of-violent-social-change-59469):

> Besta and his colleagues found that some of the psychopathic traits were linked to support for group violence and radical group actions. "What is also interesting is the interplay between disinhibition and group identification when it comes to support violence on behalf of right-wing groups. Among weak identifiers, there was no relationship between disinhibition and support for violent actions, but this link became significant when strong identifiers were considered." "I would like to stress that our results do not mean that people who choose violent action on behalf of one group are always antisocial or display traits like disinhibition. Violent collective actions are very often chosen for reasons not linked to individual predispositions," Besta explained.

## Neuroscience study indicates that LSD “frees” brain activity from anatomical constraints - The psychedelic state induced by LSD appears to weaken the association between anatomical brain structure and functional connectivity, finds new fMRI study.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/neuroscience-study-indicates-that-lsd-frees-brain-activity-from-anatomical-constraints-59458):

> Consciousness is believed to involve the integration of multiple segregated brain networks and their subnetworks, and the researchers sought to better understand how these patterns of brain connectivity varied over time under the influence of LSD. Luppi and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the structural and functional brain connectivity of 15 healthy volunteers during two separate sessions. During the other, they were given an active dose of LSD. Typically, "Neurons that fire together, wire together." But the researchers found that LSD decoupled the relationship between structural and functionally connectivity, indicating that brain activity is "Less constrained than usual by the presence or absence of an underlying anatomical connection" under the influence of the substance. "Studying psychoactive substances offers a unique opportunity for neuroscience: we can study their effects in terms of brain chemistry, but also at the level of brain function and subjective experience," he added.

## A study found that more than a third of Americans are either unlikely or at least hesitant to get a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. Respondents cited vaccine safety and effectiveness assessments as the primary basis for hesitancy

> I got my second dose 3 days ago and I experienced a swollen lymph node, some body chills and aches, vomiting, and a headache. The headache is the only thing that lasted more 12 hours. I told my coworkers because they won’t get it and I wanted to be transparent and honest. I thought this would make them feel better because it’s just a sign your immune system is working and they responded with “that’s why I don’t want to get it. I don’t want to feel like you or get a rash on my arm like the other person I work with” and I could think about was guys both of these reactions are so much better than getting Covid

> "Although winds are taken into account to some degree when planning routes, considerations such as reducing the total cost of operating the flight are currently given a higher priority than minimising the fuel burn and pollution."
> 
> And that won’t change. So just tax the carbon emissions. Problem solved.

## Wood can easily be turned transparent to make energy-saving windows

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2265874-wood-can-easily-be-turned-transparent-to-make-energy-saving-windows/):

> The standard process for making wood transparent typically involves soaking the wood in a vat of sodium chlorite - a chemical compound used in some bleaches and toothpastes - to remove a structural component of the wood called lignin. After soaking the wood in ethanol to remove any remaining gunk, they filled the pores in the wood with clear epoxy, a step that is also part of making lignin-free transparent wood. The final product is a piece of wood that allows more than 90 per cent of light to pass through it and is more than 50 times stronger than transparent wood with the lignin completely removed.
