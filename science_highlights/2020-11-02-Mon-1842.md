## US counties that voted Republican over Democrat in the 2016 presidential election exhibited 14% less physical distancing between March and May 2020, with subsequently higher COVID-19 infection and fatality growth rates in pro-Trump counties.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00977-7):

> To determine whether physical distancing differs as a function of partisanship, we examined whether the political leaning of over 3,000 counties in the United States is linked to the extent to which residents of those counties practised physical distancing behaviours during the first few months of the pandemic. To account for this and other possible explanations, we included numerous covariates in our models when testing partisan differences in physical distancing and health outcomes. The present work used the geotracking data of approximately 15 million people per day across the United States to examine whether partisan identity is linked to objective measures of physical distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.

> This trend seems to be captured in similar magnitude in the Florida early voting totals. As of today 57% of the votes cast by registered Republicans have been in person early voting (rather than mail-in) compared to about 40% for registered Democrats.

## Wearing a 3-layer nonmedical face mask was not associated with a decline in oxygen saturation in older participants. The pooled mean Spo2 was 96.1% before, 96.5% while, and 96.3% after wearing the mask.

Summary of [original article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772655):

> Based on the evidence that nonmedical face masks prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,1,2 many governments are mandating the wearing of masks in the community. We examined whether wearing nonmedical face masks was associated with a change in oxygen saturation. These results do not support claims that wearing nonmedical face masks in community settings is unsafe.

`/u/shittywizard5` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jmlyyw/wearing_a_3layer_nonmedical_face_mask_was_not/):

> Wearing a mask traps warmth released on expiration. It is uncomfortable, and I expect that many people associate the trapped heat with trapped air and not being able to get O2
> 
> Edit, since a lot of people are looking at this: I’m a hospice nurse. I’ve been taking care of a lot of covid+ patients at home. Yeah the masks are warm and they might feel claustrophobic, but hospitals are filling up and they are going to be rationing care soon if they aren’t already. Some states are heading into the “death panel” situation that the GOP crapped their pants about just a few years ago. We get most of our new patients as they are discharging from the hospital. Hospitals are trying to turn over beds faster than I have seen in the last 8 years of doing this work, trying to make room for covid patients that have a chance of surviving. If you want to have functioning health care system at all, wear your fucking mask and limit your in-person social interaction.

## A new study of three Neanderthal children's baby teeth has found striking similarities between when they began eating solid foods and when modern human babies do. This discovery provides insight into Neanderthal home life and overturns previously held assumptions about the species' death.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/neanderthal-baby-teeth):

> The moment a baby weans from milk to eating solid foods is a huge milestone in human development - and now a new study reveals that ancient Neanderthal babies may have followed a similar path. The researchers found that both the Neanderthal babies and the Upper Paleolithic human baby transitioned to eating solid foods at around the same age - between their fifth and sixth months of life. This study overturns the consensus that weaning age - and its relationship with maternal fertility - somehow contributed to the Neanderthals' eventual demise as a species.

> I think it's safe to say at this point we have no clue what happened to the Neanderthals. We have a lot of good guesses, but such little evidence exists that when we find anything, we have to completely rethink everything.

## A new study finds that teens, especially girls, have better mental health when they spend more time taking part in extracurricular activities, like sports and art, and less time in front of screens. The findings are especially relevant now when teens may be spending more time in front of screens.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ubc.ca/2020/11/02/teens-who-participate-in-extracurriculars-get-less-screen-time-have-better-mental-health/):

> A new study from UBC researchers finds that teens, especially girls, have better mental health when they spend more time taking part in extracurricular activities, like sports and art, and less time in front of screens. "Our findings highlight extracurricular activities as an asset for teens' mental wellbeing. Finding safe ways for children and teens to continue to participate in these activities during current times may be a way to reduce screen time and promote mental health and wellbeing." Among both boys and girls mental health was strongest when teens both participated in extracurricular activities and spent less than two hours on screen time.

## New way of cooking rice removes arsenic and retains mineral nutrients, study shows cooking rice in a certain way removes over 50 per cent of the naturally occurring arsenic in brown rice, and 74 per cent in white rice, according to new research.

## Ancient Mesopotamian Texts Show PTSD May Be as Old as Combat Itself

Summary of [original article](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/ptsd-may-old-combat/):

> Mesopotamian texts more than 3,000 years old reveal that post-traumatic stress disorder may be as ancient as combat itself. Researchers studying ancient Assyrian texts from Mesopotamia dating between 1300 BCE and 609 BCE-translated and assembled by JoAnn Scurlock and Burton Andersen in their 2005 book Diagnoses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine-discovered references to ancient soldiers afflicted with symptoms that sound remarkably similar to our current understanding of PTSD. Walid Khalid Abdul-Hamid, an honorary senior lecturer in psychiatry at Queen Mary University of London, and Jamie Hacker Hughes, director of the Veterans and Families Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, published their findings just last month in the journal Early Science and Medicine. Until now, the oldest texts thought to reference PTSD were from the Greek historian Herodotus, who described of the battle of Marathon in 490 BCE in which an Athenian fighter suffers a hallucination and blindness.

## Heart injury was observed in 62.3% of COVID-19 patients, and heart structural abnormalities were present in nearly two-thirds of these patients who underwent an echocardiogram test. In-hospital mortality rate for such patients was 31.7%.

> To clarify some confusion about the wording of the title, myocardial injury was found in 62.3% (n=190) of COVID-19 patients who received an echocardiogram during hospital admission (n=305). Among these patients with myocardial injury, 63.2% (n=120) exhibited cardiac structural abnormalities. The in-hospital mortality rate of patients with myocardial injury and structural abnormalities was 31.7%.
