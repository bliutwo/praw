## Lubricant found in a beetle's leg is more slippery than Teflon

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2283348-lubricant-found-in-a-beetles-leg-is-more-slippery-than-teflon/):

> A lubricant harvested from beetle legs reduces friction more than Teflon. Many beetles are known to have a natural lubricant in their joints that prevents wear and tear. The team found that pores in the shell of the beetle around the leg joint exude the waxy lubricant in cylinders up to 1 micrometre wide.

> This is exciting, if it can be mass produced. As it is protein based, it is not going to involve the side production of forever-chemicals like Teflon does.

## Male dolphins can learn each other's names- specific whistles- given to the by their mother. The findings suggest a sense of team membership, which has never been observed in animals before.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22668-1):

> Even if male A has not consorted a female with male B, the triadic interactions within second-order alliances mean that it is likely that A has consorted a female with another male that, in turn, has consorted a female with B. Investing in, and responding to, all second-order alliance members equally may therefore result in significant by-product benefits36. As our results do not reflect the strongly differentiated relationships within second-order alliances, they suggest that male dolphins form a concept of cooperative 'team' membership at the second-order alliance level based on their reciprocal relationships. 21.Connor, R. C., Smolker, R. A. & Richards, A. F. Two levels of alliance formation among male bottlenose dolphins.

> Based on other evidence in studies of dolphins, orca, whales, and other species, I think it is high time that we considered dolphins and other cetacea to be social and sentient, just different from us. As sentient beings, we have an obligation to respect them and protect them just as we would human beings.

## The impact of loneliness in old age on life and health expectancy. Findings show that people aged 60, who perceive themselves to be sometimes lonely or mostly lonely, can expect to live three to five years less, on average, compared to peers who perceive themselves as never lonely.

Summary of [original article](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/about/media/media-releases/media-releases/impact-of-loneliness-on-life-and-health-expectancy):

> The first to quantify the impact of loneliness on longevity and quality of life among seniors, the study highlights the seriousness of addressing loneliness as populations age around the world and COVID-19 measures potentially exacerbate it. Today, the impact of loneliness in old age on life and health expectancy has been categorically quantified for the first time in a study by scientists at Duke-NUS Medical School, Nihon University and their collaborators, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Using the same dataset, the researchers found that the perception of loneliness has a similar impact on two types of health expectancy-remaining years of life lived in a self-rated state of good health as well as remaining years of life lived without being limited when going about 'activities of daily living'.

## Adult ADHD is linked to numerous physical conditions. Individuals with ADHD had a statistically significant increased risk of all studied physical conditions except arthritis. The strongest associations were found for nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and metabolic diseases

> >The diagnoses most strongly associated with ADHD were alcohol-related liver disease, sleep disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, fatty liver disease and obesity. ADHD was also linked to a slightly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease and dementia.
> 
> These symptoms correlate with a school & work culture that forces people to work in a regimented way or lose their jobs. That drives people to drink, smoke, overwork, take dangerous drugs, and overeat. I wonder if they controlled for ADHD diagnoses for people with unstructured work environments.
> 
> God forbid we take an individual's mental health into consideration and try to probe as to why they're making bad health decisions. Must be a problem with *them.*

## Tell-tale signs of high stroke risk may appear a decade in advance. Stroke patients experienced much steeper declines in cognitive abilities and routine daily functioning, starting around a decade before their first stroke, than people who didn’t have a stroke

> 
> Stroke patients experienced much steeper declines in cognitive abilities and routine daily functioning, starting around a decade before their first stroke, than people who didn’t have a stroke, the findings show.

> Women, carriers of the APOE gene that is associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and those with fewer academic qualifications, seem to be at greatest risk.
> 
> The deterioration in cognitive skills and the inability to carry out routine activities of independent daily living, which are common after a stroke, are attributable to a build-up of physiological changes. But it’s not clear when these changes actually start.
> 
> To explore this further, the researchers repeatedly used various accredited tests to assess the cognitive abilities, such as memory, verbal fluency, reaction times, and manual dexterity,  of 14,712 Rotterdam Study participants between 1990 and 2016.
> 
> The tests included the Mini Mental State Exam, widely used to assess memory problems and dementia severity; the Stroop task, which tests the speed of mental processing; the Purdue Pegboard test, which assesses manual dexterity.

## Female vampire bats establish an egalitarian community within a roost rather than a society based on a clear hierarchy of dominance that is often seen in animal groups, a new study suggests.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/for-female-vampire-bats-an-equal-chance-to-rule-the-roost/):

> Female vampire bats establish an egalitarian community within a roost rather than a society based on a clear hierarchy of dominance that is often seen in animal groups, a new study suggests. His research on highly social female vampire bats, whose behaviors resemble what's been observed in some primate groups, has focused on cooperation, finding that vampire bats make "Friends" through a gradual buildup of trust and show signs of maintaining those friendships in the wild. A comparison of group-level dominance measures between female vampire bats and 14 other documented female mammal groups - including African elephants, bison and numerous primates - placed the bats as either 12th or 15th in the overall dominance ranking, depending on the metric used.

> From the paper's conclusion:
> 
> >"In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis have found that animal protein tends to have a more favorable effect on lean mass compared to plant protein, and the benefit appears more pronounced in younger adults. On the other hand, protein source is not likely to have an impact on muscle strength."
> 
> It's interesting how mass was increased with animal protein, but strength was virtually the same.
