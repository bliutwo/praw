## Sleep deprivation impairs the suppression of unwanted thoughts and memories which enter conscious awareness when individuals confront reminders. Sleep-deprived people experienced significantly more intrusions and unsuccessful suppressions of unwanted thoughts.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702620951511):

> Participants initially encoded face-scene pairs by studying them one at a time for 6 s. To reinforce learning and ensure adequate knowledge of the face-scene pairs, we then had participants complete a test phase in which faces were displayed individually for up to 4 s and participants indicated whether they were able to fully visualize the associated scene. Sleep-deprived participants exhibited significantly higher relapse probability scores than did the sleep group, F(1, 57) = 7.08, p =.010, ηp2 =.11, indicating that after initially gaining control over an intrusive thought, they suffered intrusion relapses more than participants who had slept. Prior research suggests that in healthy participants, acute sleep deprivation increases LF-HRV. Replicating this work, our sleep-deprived participants exhibited higher LF-HRV compared with participants who slept.

## High achievement cultures may kill students' interest in math—specially for girls. Girls were significantly less interested in math in countries like Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden and New Zealand. But, surprisingly, the roles were reversed in countries like Oman, Malaysia, Palestine and Kazakhstan.

> In the UK, there's a culture of "ugh maths is hard, I can't do it, I hate it" particularly in older generations, which must have an influence on newer generations. Is this a thing in other countries?

## Scientists have found even when cardiovascular risk factors were optimally controlled, adults with type 2 diabetes had a 21% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 31% higher risk of heart failure, compared to those without diabetes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/well-managed-type-2-diabetes-patients-have-21-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease/):

> Even when cardiovascular risk factors were optimally controlled, adults with type 2 diabetes had a 21% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 31% higher risk of heart failure, compared to those without diabetes. Professor Sarah Wild, co-senior author from the University of Edinburgh, added: "Our team sought to determine how the degree of risk factor control in people in the UK with type 2 diabetes affects CVD risk and mortality compared to people with type 2 diabetes who had all risk factors optimally controlled and to people who do not have type 2 diabetes." "Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: "This research, funded by Diabetes UK, shows that although having type 2 diabetes adds to the risk of developing heart disease, by keeping blood sugars, blood pressure and blood fats in a healthy range, and having a healthy lifestyle - you can minimise that risk."It is also an important reminder that people with type 2 diabetes should not delay taking steps to prevent heart disease.

> Well managed adults with type 2 diabetes have a 21% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the general population, according to new research.
> 
> The research from The University of Manchester, led by Professor Martin Rutter and Professor Darren Ashcroft, in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, is published in the journal Circulation and was supported by Diabetes UK.
> 
> “People with type 2 diabetes should attempt to lead healthy lifestyles and be treated for cardiovascular risk factors as early as possible, regardless of whether they have cardiovascular disease or not,” said co-senior author Professor Martin Rutter.
> 
> Co-senior author Professor Darren Ashcroft added: “There is real potential here to reduce the overall impact of type 2 diabetes on future cardiovascular events, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not yet been diagnosed with CVD.”
> 
> Dr Alison Wright based at the University’s Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, and first author for this study, said: “A Swedish study has suggested that people with type 2 diabetes had little or no excess risk of cardiovascular disease events or death when all risk factors are optimally controlled.

## Reduced sleep duration and sleep deprivation significantly correlates with decreased brain white matter integrity in healthy, young adults, which may explain the positive association between sleep duration and overall cognitive performance.

## A subtle shift in language, silently referring to oneself using one’s own name and non–first-person-singular pronouns (distanced self-talk), promotes emotion regulation, through reduced emotional reactivity when people reflected on negative experiences.

## Children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers — and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson. Retribution is a driving force in young children’s moral judgement.

Summary of [original article](https://news.yale.edu/2020/11/23/children-more-willing-punish-if-wrongdoer-taught-lesson):

> Many children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers - and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson, a new Yale study published Nov. 23 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour shows. The children first had to decide whether to punish the art destroyer by taking away their iPad. However, if the children decided to punish the transgressor, they would have to make a personal sacrifice - their own iPad would be locked away. Children in the second group, who knew that the wrongdoer would be told why he or she was being disciplined, were 24% more likely to punish than the first group.

`/u/tocktober` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k2bfrt/children_are_willing_to_make_personal_sacrifices/):

> I'd be interested to know more about the kids in their sample. one author says "Children are less exposed to social ideas about how to behave in certain ways" and it seems like the underlying assumption there is "because they have less exposure to ideas, their natural impulses will be more exposed" but that honestly seems like a HUGE assumption to make. it says the kids were between the ages of 4-7, which covers a huge range of developmental milestones. And even the youngest still has 4 years of being punished or disciplined by their own parents at the very least. What if they're not exhibiting natural inclinations as much as they are reflecting what they've observed and learned?

## Self-continuity forms the very basis of identity. Every time you use the word 'I', you're referring to a thread that stitches a series of experiences into a tapestry of a lifetime, representing a relationship between the self of your youth with one yet to emerge.

## Brain mapping study links abnormal sleeping patterns to decreased white matter integrity

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/brain-mapping-study-links-abnormal-sleeping-patterns-to-decreased-white-matter-integrity-58647):

> The study, published in Human Brain Mapping, abnormal sleeping patterns are associated with decreased white matter integrity in a particular area of the brain. "We are working with data from diffusion tensor imaging, which provides imaging and analysis of white matter integrity. Insights into the so-called connectome of the human brain is one major research field of today's cognitive neuroscience to reveal how the brain structure is enabling higher brain function. We are focused on how the connectome is altered in psychiatric diseases and how future therapies might address these alterations," Grumbach explained. "Our study showed that shorter sleep duration is associated with decreased white matter integrity in one major fiber tract, which is called the superior longitudinal fasciculus. This white matter tract is important for working memory and language processing in the brain," Grumbach told PsyPost.
