## The coronavirus was present in the U.S. weeks earlier than scientists and public health officials previously thought, and before cases in China were publicly identified, according to a new government study published Monday

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/01/940395651/coronavirus-was-in-u-s-weeks-earlier-than-previously-known-study-says):

> Study: COVID-19 Reached U.S. Earlier Than Health Officials Previously Thought : Coronavirus Updates The discovery, uncovered after analyzing blood donations from nine states, strengthens evidence that the coronavirus was quietly spreading around the world before health officials were aware. The coronavirus was present in the U.S. weeks earlier than scientists and public health officials previously thought, and before cases in China were publicly identified, according to a new government study published Monday. "SARS-CoV-2 infections may have been present in the U.S. in December 2019, earlier than previously recognized," the authors said.

> Antibodies found in sera collected as early as Dec 13, 2019 suggests the exposure happened at least 2 weeks earlier - 4-5d of incubation then 10d to make antibodies. That puts the first cases in November 2019 - and the article does not mention testing sera collected before Dec 13th, so the first case could have been even earlier.

## A weaker, nonviolent police force could be a sign of a stronger democracy - A new study of a nonviolent encounter with police in Taiwan shows how the weakness of police power can be treated as an index for the strength of democratic values.

## Using post-mortem tissue samples, scientists showed that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via nerve cells in the olfactory mucosa. For the first time, researchers have been able to produce electron microscope images of intact coronavirus particles inside the olfactory mucosa.

Summary of [original article](https://www.charite.de/en/service/press_reports/artikel/detail/how_sars_cov_2_reaches_the_brain/):

> Until now, researchers had suspected that these manifestations must be caused by the virus entering and infecting specific cells in the brain. How does SARS-CoV-2 get there? Under the joint leadership of Dr. Helena Radbruch of Charité's Department of Neuropathology and the Department's Director, Prof. Dr. Frank Heppner, a multidisciplinary team of researchers has now traced how the virus enters the central nervous system and subsequently invades the brain. "We also found SARS-CoV-2 in areas of the brain which control vital functions, such as breathing. It cannot be ruled out that, in patients with severe COVID-19, presence of the virus in these areas of the brain will have an exacerbating impact on respiratory function, adding to breathing problems due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs. Similar problems might arise in relation to cardiovascular function."

> I suppose it’s no worse than any other way that a virus can get to the brain but to me it seems a little extra horrifying thinking about breathing the virus in and it getting stuck in the mucus in my sinuses and then traveling through nerves into my brain. Every time I take a breath through my nose now, I’m thinking about what could possibly be crawling up to my brain.

## Scientists have developed a way of predicting if patients will develop Alzheimer's disease by analysing their blood. The model based off of these two proteins had an 88 percent success rate in predicting the onset of Alzheimers in the same patients over the course of four years.

> Alzheimer’s terrifies me. I’m currently a caregiver for my mother who is in the moderate stages of Alzheimer’s, and rapidly moving towards advanced. It’s not even the forgetfulness that scares me, or the ‘living in the past’ aspect, it’s the mixing up of different events and stories. My mother mixes up my siblings and I all the time: the latest is her repeatedly saying that I used to throw my vegetables out the window as a child, but that was actually my older sister who’s over 20 years older than I. She combines things that happened yesterday with things that happened 6 years ago, she combines experiences with her first husband with stories about her second husband (my dad). And if I gently try and correct her, she is adamant that her version is the truth. What’s worse are when she occasionally realizes that she *is* actually confusing things; I can see in that moment how troubling it is for her and it hurts to watch every time. 
> 
> Not knowing what your truth is, not knowing what’s real or not, and being trapped in your own mind, is just a horror to me.
> 
> 
> Edit: I wanted to clarify the part about “gently correcting”, since that’s what the majority of comments here have been about. My mother has been emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive my whole life. When she’s confused or mistaken, 99 % of the time I let it be. I know she’s already under great stress and who wants to be corrected all the time? I’m specifically speaking to the occasions where she verbally abuses me based on events/incidents that never happened. It gets bad, and it’s painful. I never argue with her or go into detail about why she’s wrong, I simply say “that didn’t happen” or “that’s not true”, and move on.

## Plants can pass on bad ‘memories’ to offspring, which results in growth and developmental defects, researchers found. Two proteins reset this epigenetic information during sexual reproduction to erase inappropriate ‘memories’ from being passed on to ensure the offspring grows normally.

Summary of [original article](https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/chemical_memory_in):

> Researchers have identified two proteins responsible for erasing plant memory to maximise chances of offspring survival. In the paper, 'A new role for histone demethylases in the maintenance of plant genome integrity' published in the journal elife, it was found that some plants were unable to forget this information and passed it on to their offspring, thereby affecting their chances of survival. "Our study into the proteins that regulate plant memory has shown how important it is for chemical marks to be reset during sexual reproduction in order to avoid offspring inheriting inappropriate 'memories' that lead to growth and developmental defects associated with genome instability."

`/u/bottleboy8` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k4nwra/plants_can_pass_on_bad_memories_to_offspring/):

> It's not exactly plant memory.  But plants know if the soil is fertile or not.  If the soil is fertile, the plant will more likely be female.  If the soil is not fertile, the plant will more likely be male.  The idea being seeds will fall on fertile soil and in poor soil the male pollen will hopefully travel to a more fertile location.

> Plants are more aware of their surroundings than people think.

## Two-million-year-old skull discovered in South Africa sheds new light on human evolution

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/skull-south-africa-australia-evolution-b1720404.html):

> Australian researchers have discovered a two-million-year-old skull in South Africa that sheds new light on human evolution. Academics from La Trobe University's Archaeology Department in Melbourne, Australia led the excavation and reconstruction of the large-toothed rare skull from the Drimolen Main Quarry north of Johannesburg, South Africa. He added the skull discovery presented a rare example of "Microevolution" within human lineage showing that Paranthropus robustus evolved their iconic chewing adaptations incrementally, possibly over hundreds of thousands of years, in response to environmental change.

## 41 studies (including 2 randomized studies) prove that a Vitamin D deficiency increases Covid 19 's infection severity, likelihood & mortality. Data shows supplementation weakens the infection, reduces it's duration, lowers mortality rate & improves outcomes.

Summary of [original article](https://vitamin-d-covid.shotwell.ca/):

> An Israeli study of 7,000 patients with pre-Covid serum vitamin D tests found that vitamin D levels were associated with Covid infection and hospitalization. An analysis of Israeli vitamin D tests performed between 2010 and 2019 found that vitamin D deficiency predicted Covid-19 infection. A prospective cohort study found that vitamin D deficiency was more common among Covid positive patients presenting with Covid symptoms than Covid negative patients, and suggested that it could be considered as a diagnostic tool.

> So summer could have been so low both cuz you could be outside in fresh air and you also got the benefit of the Sun giving you more Vitamin D. A Full-Spectrum light box could be the hot Christmas item this year.

## Pets, Touch, and COVID-19 - "A new study finds that pets have played a lifesaving role during 2020 lockdowns by providing much-needed comfort via cuddles, pats, and a constant physical presence."

Summary of [original article](https://www.unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2020/pets-touch-and-covid-19-why-our-furry-friends-are-lifesavers/):

> The health benefits have been widely reported, but little data exists regarding the specific benefits that pets bring to humans in terms of touch. In interviews with 32 people, more than 90 per cent said touching their pets both comforted and relaxed them - and the pets seemed to need it as well. "In the era of COVID-19, social distancing, sudden lockdowns and societal upheaval, our pets may be the only living beings that many people are able to touch and draw comfort from."
