## A Never-Before-Seen Type of Signal Has Been Detected in The Human Brain

> Typical neuron activity is mediated by sodium and allow cells to perform logical "and" and "or" operations. They discovered that in a sample taken from an epilepsy patient (a section removed to treat the epilepsy), the neurons could also be mediated by calcium which allows the neurons to perform a logical xor operation. They confirmed this activity in tumorous sections of brain that had been removed during surgery. This has not observed this behavior in mice before.
> 
> So it looks like we need to find out if this mechanism is in all humans or only epileptic and cancer patients. We also need to find out if it's all neurons or only ones from certain areas of the brain that can do this. Then we have to start studying a bunch of other primates and mammals to find out if it's just humans that have this signaling pathway.
> 
> It would be very interesting to find out that only humans have this mechanism (though I sincerely doubt that is the case), because it could give some strong clues to why humans developed higher intelligence. I look forward to seeing the work of other groups to confirm this, and to expand the research to help us better understand the extent of this previously unobserved mechanism.

## Field Sobriety Tests and THC Levels Unreliable Indicators of Marijuana Intoxication

> Hmmm i hope people who got marijuana DUI's for having THC in their system can maybe get some justice with this. If someone smoked several hours before driving and then got pulled over and blood tested, they get a marijuana DUI in some counties and states. Then you get patronizingly sent to Alcoholic treatment classes because they never developed an individual program for marijuana related DUI's, and they charge you 3-5 thousand dollars.

## Single blood test detects over 50 types of cancer. The test showed higher sensitivity in patients with more disease progression, and it detected cancer in nine out of 10 stage-4 cancer patients.

> U.S. researchers said they have developed a blood test that can detect over 50 types of cancer simultaneously.
> 
> The test showed higher sensitivity in patients with more disease progression, and it detected cancer in nine out of 10 stage-4 cancer patients.
> 
> The research team, led by Dr. Eric A. Klein at the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute of Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, published the study results that evaluated the effect of the multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test in the Annals of Oncology on Thursday.
> 
> The MCED test finds whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) exists in cancer cells in the blood.
> 
> The study measured the MCED test’s specificity, sensitivity, and cancer signal origin (CSO) in 4,077 participants – 2,823 cancer patients and 1,254 without cancer.
> 
> The researchers measured sensitivity with the proportion of participants with a positive test result among cancer patients and specificity with the proportion of people with a negative test result among non-cancer participants.
> 
> The results showed that overall sensitivity for cancer signal detection was 51.5 percent, and sensitivity increased with the cancer stage.

## The use of mescaline, a psychedelic substance derived from the peyote cactus, appears to be associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, according to a new preliminary study published in the journal ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/06/use-of-mescaline-may-facilitate-unintended-improvements-in-several-psychiatric-conditions-study-suggests-61280):

> The use of mescaline, a psychedelic substance derived from the peyote cactus, appears to be associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, according to a new preliminary study published in the journal ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science. The research on the long-term psychological effects of mescaline use is still in a very early stage and the study has some important caveats to consider. "Nevertheless, the results from our study indicate that when administered in a naturalistic setting, mescaline may facilitate unintended improvements in self-reported depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders," they added.

> How many articles should we see that psychedelics help depression and anxiety before we start to implement them? Seriously, it's proven let's get on that horse now please.
> 
> Edit: thanks for the awards guys, didn't expect this, I just wanted to give voice to my frustration:)

## Mind-Blowing 'Inflatable' Spinal Cord Implant Could Make Pain Relief Widely Available

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/mind-blowing-spinal-cord-implant-could-relieve-suffering-for-chronic-pain-patients):

> The inflatable electronic device is part of a spinal cord stimulator setup, a type of well-established therapy that delivers mild electric currents to a person's spinal cord via implanted electrodes. That current is sent by a small, implanted pulse generator device, and the whole thing reduces pain because the electrical pulses help to mask pain signals traveling to the brain via the spinal cord. The trickiest aspect of currently available SCS devices is the part where you have to stick electrodes into a person's spinal column, laying them across the dura, the fibrous outer layer that wraps around the nerve cells within.

> But wait a second. We already have a wonderful pain-mitigating solution that is “totally not addictive if you are dealing with real pain” courtesy of Sackler family.

## A new vaccine to protect against deadly cholera has been made by grinding up genetically modified grains of rice. The first human trial has shown no obvious side effects and a good immune response.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uot-ecv062221.php):

> A new vaccine to protect against deadly cholera has been made by grinding up genetically modified grains of rice. There are four modern needle-free cholera vaccines, all of which are given as drops on the tongue, but require cold storage and are made from whole killed or live-attenuated cholera cells; https://www. The new cholera vaccine grows in genetically modified Japanese short-grain rice plants that produce a nontoxic portion of CTB that can be recognized by the immune system.

> Room temperature vaccines, edible or not, would be a real help in places like Africa. We're having a hell of a time trying to keep all these fancy vaccines cold enough

## Despite being tightly confined in a microscopic volume, a new kind of disorder allows optical signals to suddenly show up at far away regions. Such abrupt transport had previously been considered impossible, and challenges the current understanding of light waves.
