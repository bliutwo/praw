> From the paper's conclusion:
> 
> >"In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis have found that animal protein tends to have a more favorable effect on lean mass compared to plant protein, and the benefit appears more pronounced in younger adults. On the other hand, protein source is not likely to have an impact on muscle strength."
> 
> It's interesting how mass was increased with animal protein, but strength was virtually the same.

## Narcissistic individuals have "thin skins" and are especially aggressive when provoked

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/narcissistic-individuals-have-thin-skins-and-are-especially-aggressive-when-provoked-61361):

> We recently reviewed 437 studies of narcissism and aggression involving a total of over 123,000 participants and found narcissism is related to a 21% increase in aggression and an 18% increase in violence. Our review found that individuals high in narcissism are especially aggressive when provoked, but are also aggressive when they aren't provoked. Research has found that "Collective narcissism" - or "My group is superior to your group" - is related to intergroup aggression, especially when one's in-group is threatened by an out-group.

> Is there somewhere online you can take a free test to see if you’re narcissistic? I was raised by a narcissist just wanna look into it.
> 
> Edit: my wife suggested I might be a bit of a narcissist. I took the online quiz in the comments below and I’m a moderate narcissist at 18pts. 20 being a full fledged narcissist.

> Can narcissism be cured or treated?

## Fundamental changes in our economies are required to secure decent living standards for all in the struggle against climate breakdown, according to new research.

Summary of [original article](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/main-index/news/article/4862/securing-decent-living-standards-for-all-while-cutting-energy-use):

> Without such fundamental changes, the study warns, we face an existential dilemma: in our current economic system, the energy savings required to avert catastrophic climate changes might undermine living standards, while the improvements in living standards required to end material poverty would need large increases in energy use, further exacerbating climate breakdown. That means current global average energy use needs to be cut in half, while affluent countries like the UK or Spain need to reduce their average energy use by as much as 65%, France by more than 70%, and the most energy-hungry countries like the USA or Canada need to cut by as much as 90%. A major concern is that such profound reductions in energy use might undermine living standards, as currently only countries with high energy use accomplish decent living standards. "With these policies in place, rich countries could slash their energy use and emissions whilst maintaining or even improving living standards; and less affluent countries could achieve decent living standards and end material poverty without needing vast amounts of energy. That's good news for climate justice, good news for human well-being, good news for poverty eradication, and good news for energy security."

## Just One Dose of Magic Mushroom Compound Regrows Lost Brain Connections in Mice

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/one-dose-of-psilocybin-regrows-lost-brain-connections-in-mice):

> Psilocybin, the active psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms, has some curious effects on the human brain. The effect of psilocybin on the dendritic spines in mice was striking. "These new connections may be the structural changes the brain uses to store new experiences."

## Study finds Leonardo da Vinci’s family tree spans 21 generations, including 14 living male descendants. The newly documented genealogy could help scientists identify Leonardo's long-lost DNA.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/tca-ldv070221.php):

> The surprising results of a decade-long investigation by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato provide a strong basis for advancing a project researching Leonardo da Vinci's DNA. Their extensive study, published by the journal "Human Evolution", documents with new certainty the continuous male line, from father to son, of the Da Vinci family, from progenitor Michele to grandson Leonardo through to today - 21 generations in all, including five family branches - and identifies 14 living descendants. Leonardo himself had at least 22 half-brothers but no children; a new unpublished document shows that "Paolo di Leonardo da Vinci da Firenze" was a case of homonymy. She has been working since 1993 researching the genealogy and living descendants of the Da Vinci, in collaborations with the Leonardo Da Vinci DNA Project since 2015.

## New anticholinergic drug keeps PTSD flashbacks and nightmares away. A significant 88% of the analyzed patients reported mild to no PTSD-related nightmares. Similarly, 79% of the analyzed patients reported similar responses for PTSD-related flashbacks

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/of3ash/new_anticholinergic_drug_keeps_ptsd_flashbacks/):

> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rings a bell for many, due to its rampant references in pop culture, and more, importantly, its prevalence in today's society. It is only probable that this disorder, which develops after shocking or dangerous events, would unfortunately affect the lives of many people. Medical researchers have been hard at work trying to come up with solutions to combat this condition and its manifestations effectively. Unfortunately, the neurological mechanisms of PTSD aren't clear, and without knowing this exactly, trying to find a cure is a shot in the dark.
> 
> Fortunately, a group of Japanese researchers from the Sogo PTSD Institute, Medical Corporation Sogokai, Japan led by Dr. Masanobu Sogo appear to have made a breakthrough in PTSD treatment! They have identified a drug called trihexyphenidyl, that can significantly reduce the flashbacks and nightmares experienced by patients with PTSD, according to a study published in Brain and Behavior, a sister open access journal to ACTA J.
> 
> Trihexyphenidyl is a central anticholinergic drug used to manage disorders like parkinsonism, and alleviate several side-effects induced by drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS). It acts by blocking the activity of a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, in the CNS. Interestingly, it has been available for therapeutic use for around 66 years.
> 
> So, what inspired the researchers to pick up this drug? In 2009, they encountered a patient who suffered severe PTSD-related flashbacks and nightmares for 9 years, was diagnosed with bacterial diarrhea at another hospital, and administered a drip infusion containing antibiotics and scopolamine butyl bromide (SB), which is a peripheral anticholinergic that doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB, penetration rate 0.01%). Twenty minutes after the infusion, the patient's flashbacks completely disappeared!
> 
> Since SB is a "peripheral" anticholinergic agent, it shouldn't be able to cross the BBB, but it is probable that the patient's brain was in a state of severe brain excitement due to PTSD. There are eight acetylcholine basal ganglia in the brain, of which the largest, the Meynert nucleus, is closely associated with BBB permeability. The researchers hypothesized that due to abnormal excitement of the Meynert basal ganglia, SB enters the brain and activates anticholinergic action to suppress abnormal acetylcholine secretion of acetylcholine-memory-related circuits centered on the Meynert basal ganglia, eliminating the flashbacks.
