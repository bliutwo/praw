## Chemists Found an Effective Remedy for “Aged” Brain Diseases. Newly synthesized compounds can halt the degradation of neurons in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease researchers say

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/ufu-cfa071921.php):

> New molecules of pyrrolyl- and indolylazine classes activate intracellular mechanisms to combat one of the main causes of "Aged" brain diseases - an excess of so-called amyloid structures that accumulate in the human brain with age. The most effective compound has been tested in living tissues of rats with secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are diseases of the brain, in which gradual degeneration of neurons leads to loss of speech, memory, and thinking.

## 15,000-year-old viruses discovered in Tibetan glacier ice

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/15000-year-old-viruses-discovered-in-tibetan-glacier-ice/):

> Scientists who study glacier ice have found viruses nearly 15,000 years old in two ice samples taken from the Tibetan Plateau in China. "These viruses have signatures of genes that help them infect cells in cold environments - just surreal genetic signatures for how a virus is able to survive in extreme conditions. These are not easy signatures to pull out, and the method that Zhi-Ping developed to decontaminate the cores and to study microbes and viruses in ice could help us search for these genetic sequences in other extreme icy environments - Mars, for example, the moon, or closer to home in Earth's Atacama Desert." The study of viruses in glaciers is relatively new: Just two previous studies have identified viruses in ancient glacier ice.

## Two common practices in the U.S. restaurant industry — service with a smile and tipping — contribute to a culture of sexual harassment, according to new research from the University of Notre Dame.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/uond-wa071921.php):

> The researchers asked the service employees to report how much power they felt customers had and then asked the employees to report how frequently they experience sexual harassment. The study suggests that service organizations can reduce customer power and sexual harassment by eliminating tipping dependence and/or requirements for "Service with a smile." "Yet, organizations often do - which may explain why sexual harassment is so pervasive in the service industry. Our research shows that paying a fair wage or eliminating tipping practices can reduce the power differential between a service worker and an employee. Alternatively, organizations can also reduce or eliminate positive display requirements."

`/u/Bored-Corvid` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/onoarn/two_common_practices_in_the_us_restaurant/):

> I work in a restaurant, I can’t count the number of a female coworker being friendly to her table has been seen as an invitation to ask for her number, make suggestive comments, or to come back and straight creep on them. One coworker in particular has a man that has come in multiple times within a single week asking to sit in her section and we deny the request because she feels so scared of the man.

## Seattle study of breast milk from 50 women finds chemical used in food wrappers, firefighting foam

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/seattle-study-of-breast-milk-from-50-women-finds-chemical-used-in-food-wrappers-firefighting-foam/):

> These chemicals are called Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances - or PFAS - and have been used over the decades in products ranging from firefighting foams to cosmetics, nonstick pans, rain gear, stain-protected sofas, some types of fast food wrappers and even dental floss. The Legislature has passed laws to phase out some products that contain PFAS. "Washington is absolutely at the forefront. Our state is the first to pass legislation banning PFAS, as a class, in firefighting foam, and other states have followed our lead," said Erika Schreder, a co-author of the breast milk study and science director at Seattle-based Toxic-Free Future, a group that has advocated for new regulation. This study represented the first PFAS analysis of breast milk in U.S. women since 2004, and offered a mixed progress report.

`/u/KwizicalKiwi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/onsq9g/seattle_study_of_breast_milk_from_50_women_finds/):

> My brother is an environmental specialist. PFAS is in almost EVERYTHING. Your frying pan coatings, your glasses lenses, plastic bottles, plastic bags, plastic, plastic, plastic. Anything waterproof or water resistant. When he takes samples of water suspected of PFAS contamination he has to wear cotton or linen. Can't wear deoderant, lotion, or sunscreen (all has PFAS). Has to use an amber glass receptacle to collect it. All these things so he doesn't contaminate the sample.The most concerning types are PFOS and PFOA. It's a huge, huge problem right now.

## Study finds second dose of COVID-19 vaccine shouldn't be skipped since it stimulated a manifold increase in antibody levels, a terrific T-cell response that was absent after the first shot alone, and a strikingly enhanced innate immune response.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03791-x):

> How mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems vaccinology approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses of 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Collectively, these data provide insights into immune responses induced by mRNA vaccination and demonstrate its capacity to prime the innate immune system to mount a more potent response following booster immunization.

## When money’s tight, parents talk less to kids - UC Berkeley research

Summary of [original article](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/16/word-gap-when-moneys-tight-parents-talk-less-to-kids/):

> The findings, published this month in the journal Developmental Science, provide the first evidence that parents may talk less to their kids when experiencing financial scarcity. Of the 84 parents in the study, those in the experimental group who described their experiences of financial scarcity spoke less to their 3-year-olds during laboratory observations than parents who reflected on other forms of scarcity, or parents who had not been asked to recollect experiences of resource insecurity. As the researchers predicted, analyses revealed that parents engaged in fewer conversational turns with their children at the month's end, a time that typically coincides with money being tight as parents await paychecks or other sources of income.

`/u/Not_a_jmod` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/onvez0/when_moneys_tight_parents_talk_less_to_kids_uc/):

> Don't forget: children aren't blind and stupid. If your parents are constantly worried and stressed, you'll be more likely to frame your own needs and wants as "bothering them" and therefore subconsciously demand less attention from them. So then the parents may get the impression you simply don't need as much direct attention as other children. Which they consider as a godsend, as they need their mental acuities to get through whichever economic crisis the family has to face this week. Cue negative spiral where these children in particular get less and less attention from their parents as time goes on.
> 
> But even the child that actually does need a lot less attention than everyone will eventually run a deficit the longer this goes on and end up looking for attention elsewhere. But they aren't practiced in how to get positive attention, so they're just brute forcing the process (think trial and error) and some will sooner figure out how to consistently garner negative attenton than a healthy way to inconsistently (since you can't please everyone at all times) garner positive attention. And since living beings tend to go the path of least resistance...
