## Cannabis reduces blood pressure in older adults, finds the first study of its kind to focus on the effect of cannabis on blood pressure, heart rate and metabolic parameters in adults 60 and above with hypertension. “Cannabis research is in its early stages”.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/aabu-crb020521.php):

> Beer-Sheva, Israel...February 8, 2021 - A new discovery by researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and its affiliated Soroka University Medical Center shows that medical cannabis may reduce blood pressure in older adults. In the study, researchers found a significant reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, with the lowest point occurring three hours after ingesting cannabis either orally via oil extracts or by smoking. The BGU researchers theorize that the relief from pain, the indication for prescription cannabis in most patients, may also have contributed to a reduction in blood pressure.

> It's really sad to imagine how many folks this information might have helped decades ago if only... Or so much more other cannabis related science.
> 
> It's so nice though, to see political dogma tossed out in exchange for actual facts. The truth is indeed refreshing.

## Research found that low-dose infusions of ketamine caused a major reduction in suicidal thoughts just 24 hours later, and had positive effects on mood, depression and fatigue that lasted for at least six weeks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.usc.edu.au/about/usc-news/news-archive/2021/february/study-finds-potential-treatment-to-reduce-chronic-suicidality):

> A new study from USC Australia has found that oral doses of ketamine administered in a clinical setting can provide a rapid-acting treatment for chronic suicidality. While the findings support the feasibility of oral ketamine as a treatment for chronic suicidality, the researchers suggest that further study is needed to test efficacy by using randomised control groups. "We also had a very complex group of patients with a variety of conditions such as depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder - all factors that can increase your potential for suicidality - yet the treatment still worked across the group."

## Republicans tend to follow Donald Trump’s opinions on vaccines rather than scientists’ opinions, according to a new study, which finds political leaders can have a notable impact on vaccine risk assessment.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/02/republicans-tend-to-follow-donald-trumps-opinions-on-vaccines-rather-than-scientists-opinions-59562):

> When it comes to the false claim that vaccines cause autism, Republicans tend to be more swayed by Donald Trump than scientists, according to new research published in the journal Health Communication. The participants were randomly assigned to read one of four different versions of the article: one cited Donald Trump claiming there was no vaccine-autism link, one cited a scientist claiming there was no vaccine-autism link, one cited Trump claiming there was a vaccine-autism link, and one cited a scientist claiming there was a vaccine-autism link. One group read a story in which scientists denied the vaccine risk but Trump raised concerns about vaccine risk. The other group read a story in which Trump denied the vaccine risk but scientists warned of vaccine risk," the researchers explained.

## Trump’s tweets may have affected US beliefs about the pandemic’s severity. Prior to his infection ~20% of tweets showed a belief that COVID-19 was a hoax, but this dropped to 3% after Trump tweeted about his infection. This reversed back to 10% after he tweeted, “Don’t be afraid of COVID-19”.

> Similar thing with the Obama born in Kenya thing. When he released his birth certificate and Trump admitted it was a lie, the denial rate went down. Over the following years when the issue wasn't really talked about any more, the denial rate went back up. A significant percentage of Americans today believe Obama was born in Kenya.

> Lies/narratives that make people feel good, no matter how random or ridiculous, are alarmingly effective

## Adding obstacles like work requirements and time limits to social welfare programs hurts individuals' mental health, according to a new review using decades of data

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/exhaustive-study-links-social-welfare-mental-health/):

> Simpson said the mental health implications of these policies must be considered alongside other health and economic concerns. In aggregate, the studies have a clear message, the researchers found: Expanding social welfare benefits improves mental health. She's also interested in conversations around universal basic income in the U.S.The paper, titled "Effects of social security policy reforms on mental health and inequalities: A systematic review of observational studies in high-income countries," is forthcoming in the March 2021 issue of Social Science & Medicine and was made available online Jan. 18.

`/u/rasterbated` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lfel9c/adding_obstacles_like_work_requirements_and_time/):

> I seem to have misplaced my surprise. 
> 
> At least in the US, we force the most vulnerable among us to jump through bureaucratic hoop after bureaucratic hoop to prove they are vulnerable enough to deserve whatever meager aid is available, all while television and radio hosts call them lazy dirtbags for having the temerity to exist and not be rich. Of course they’re unhappy.
> 
> The system‘s abusiveness is also an important part of the social message we send the poor in my country: we’d really rather you’d vanish.

## Baby mice recognize their mothers, just like human infants do. And researchers have found that mouse pups form memories of their mothers that last into adulthood.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00216-7):

> Baby mice recognize their mamas, just like human infants do. They also 'whistled' more for her than for the unknown mouse, another sign that baby mice recognize and prefer their mums. Once weaned mice sought to make the stranger's acquaintance instead. After spending time with their foster mothers, young mice experienced a rise in the activity of neurons in a brain region involved in social memory - an animal's ability to recognize and remember members of its own species.

`/u/Yolorosa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lesrnt/baby_mice_recognize_their_mothers_just_like_human/):

> I disturbed a mouse nest while turning my compost once.  I found two babies and put them back in the remains of the nest, but the next morning one was dead and the other obviously abandoned.
> I brought it inside and with the help of YouTube kept it alive for 3 days, but at day 3 it started refusing food. At this point I could see mouse tunnels again in the compost so it was obvious the mother had rebuilt - I decided to put the baby back as without food it'd die in the next few hours and I was hoping the mother might take it back now she had a nest again.
> 
> She did! Went out the next morning fearing the worst, and the little thing (still blind) heard my voice and came crawling out of the tunnel towards me. It wouldn't have survived the night if the mother hadn't fed it.
> I left them alone after that but it was cool it recognised me, and that the mother recognised it. 
> 
> A few weeks later I uncovered the compost again and several mice did their usual thing of freaking out and scattering, but one just sat and looked at me for ages. Can't prove it but I'm pretty sure that was the same one.

## Scientists have learned that disagreeing with the opinion of other people leaves a ‘trace’ in brain activity, which allows the brain to later adjust its opinion in favour of the majority-held point of view. The opinions of others also causes long-term changes in the way our brains work

## 'Conservatives' may be more liberal than they let on - conservatives in general aren’t as likely as their liberal counterparts to exclude ideological rivals from their social circles because many people who report right-leaning identities “are not particularly wedded to conservative policies.”
