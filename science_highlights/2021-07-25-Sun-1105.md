## Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher hospitalisation risk from COVID-19: a retrospective case-control study

Summary of [original article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34139758/):

> Context: One of the risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is postulated to be vitamin D deficiency. To understand better the role of vitamin D deficiency in the disease course of COVID-19, we undertook a retrospective case-control study in the North West of England. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation.

`/u/ABoss` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/or5v2y/vitamin_d_deficiency_is_associated_with_higher/):

> Since the ["High prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in obese subjects is a well-documented finding"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780345/) and in turn obese subjects have seen worse COVID outcomes, this association isn't surprising.

> The first states to withdraw support didn't see a jump in jobs in the weeks following their withdrawal, according to an analysis published by Arindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Census Bureau data suggests recipients didn't rush to find jobs in the weeks following the first batch of state withdrawals, according to Arindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His findings are in line with recent analyses published by the job site Indeed, which found job-search activity was muted in the states that cut federal benefits.

## Belief in science predicts face mask wearing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The findings provide evidence that those who place a greater value in scientific information are more likely to engage in behaviors intended to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/people-who-believe-in-science-are-more-likely-to-wear-masks-in-public-to-battle-covid-19-61579):

> Those with a greater belief in science were also more likely to agree with statements such as "Face masks provide protection from the possibility of transmitting COVID-19.". "Our data suggest that people who believe in science broadly more readily acquire knowledge about the importance of engaging in the preventative behavior of mask wearing, and are therefore more likely to partake in this preventative behavior." "We suspect that increasing science education, requiring researchers to participate in open science practices, and encouraging political figures, business leaders, and celebrities to speak more openly and honestly about the importance and impact of scientific findings may contribute to an increase in public trust and belief in science as an institution."

> The whole point of science is not to have “beliefs.”

## The insect apocalypse: ‘Our world will grind to a halt without them’

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/25/the-insect-apocalypse-our-world-will-grind-to-a-halt-without-them):

> As insects become more scarce, our world will slowly grind to a halt, for it cannot function without them. Perhaps the best-studied insect populations in the world are the UK's butterflies. Information about insect populations in the tropics, where most insects live, is sparse.

> Scientists across the world are warning that we are in the midst of an “insect apocalypse,” due in large part to the overuse of toxic pesticides. Tell Kroger Supermarket to say no to bee-killing pesticides in its supply chain.
