> The gut is our second brain. Neurotransmitters are made in the gut. There are so many studies that link our gut to the brain. We need to pay more attention to diet and gut health if we want to improve mental well being.

## People who have night owl chronotype don't fall asleep early enough to get the recommended 7+ hours of sleep. Long term sleep deprivation is linked to poorer overall health and cognitive performance. Night 'owls' may be twice as likely as morning 'larks' to underperform at work.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/b-om021921.php):

> Night 'owls' may be twice as likely as morning 'larks' to underperform at work and to run a heightened risk of early retirement due to disability, finds research published online in the journal Occupational & Environmental Medicine. Around 1 in 4 of the men and women classified as owls were underperforming at work when they were 46, a significantly higher proportion than among larks or intermediate chronotypes. The odds of underperformance were twice as high among the owls as they were among the larks in both sexes even after taking account of potentially influential factors, such as sleep duration and working hours.

## Scientists for the first time transplanted bile duct organoids grown in the lab into damaged human livers to repair them. As proof-of-principle, they repaired livers deemed unsuitable for transplantation due to bile duct damage, an important step given the chronic shortage of donor organs.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/lab-grown-mini-bile-ducts-used-to-repair-human-livers-in-regenerative-medicine-first?T=AU):

> The research paves the way for cell therapies to treat liver disease - in other words, growing 'mini-bile ducts' in the lab as replacement parts that can be used to restore a patient's own liver to health - or to repair damaged organ donor livers, so that they can still be used for transplantation. Bile ducts act as the liver's waste disposal system, and malfunctioning bile ducts are behind a third of adult and 70 per cent of children's liver transplantations, with no alternative treatments. Using this technology, they demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to transplant biliary cells grown in the lab known as cholangiocytes into damaged human livers to repair them.

## How a single cell slime mold makes smart decisions without a central nervous system. Scientists have now identified how the slime mold Physarum polycephalum saves memories – although it has no nervous system.

Summary of [original article](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/36462/):

> An encounter with food triggers the release of a chemical that travels from the location where food was found throughout the organism and softens the tubes in the network, making the whole organism reorient its migration towards the food. "Past feeding events are embedded in the hierarchy of tube diameters, specifically in the arrangement of thick and thin tubes in the network." "For the softening chemical that is now transported, the thick tubes in the network act as highways in traffic networks, enabling quick transport across the whole organism", adds Mirna Kramar.

`/u/blorgalorp` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lroq7e/how_a_single_cell_slime_mold_makes_smart/):

> TLDR - cell is tubes, tubes find food, releases chemical that softens tubes in direction of food, tubes grow towards food, network of tubes w/ varying degrees of softness and structure serve as sort of memory

## NIH scientists used bacteriophage viruses to successfully treat mice infected with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of the biggest antibiotic resistance threats. Using viruses instead of antibiotics to treat drug-resistant bacteria is a promising strategy known as “phage therapy.”

## Scientists begin building highly accurate digital twin of our planet. A digital twin of our planet is to simulate the Earth system in future. It is intended to support policy-​makers in taking appropriate measures to better prepare for extreme events.

Summary of [original article](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/02/a-highly-accurate-digital-twin-of-our-planet.html):

> During this period, a highly accurate digital model of the Earth is to be created, a digital twin of the Earth, to map climate development and extreme events as accurately as possible in space and time. Observational data will be continuously incorporated into the digital twin in order to make the digital Earth model more accurate for monitoring the evolution and predict possible future trajectories. The scientists see their strategy paper as a starting point on the path to a digital twin of the Earth.

`/u/Jz27kr3-2gm` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/lrl1bs/scientists_begin_building_highly_accurate_digital/):

> Because policy makers are famous for listening to scientists’ warnings.
