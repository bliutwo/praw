## Dogs may never learn that every sound of a word matters. Despite their great hearing, dogs cannot tell the difference between words which differ in only one speech sound (dog vs dig), finds a new brain wave study. This may explain why the number of words dogs learn to recognize remains low.

Summary of [original article](https://ttk.elte.hu/en/content/dogs-may-never-learn-that-every-sound-of-a-word-matters.t.4008):

> Despite their excellent auditory capacities, dogs do not attend to differences between words which differ only in one speech sound, according to a new study by Hungarian researchers of the MTA-ELTE 'Lendület' Neuroethology of Communication Research Group at the Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest measuring brain activity with non-invasive electroencephalography on awake dogs. Dogs can distinguish human speech sounds and there are similarities in the neuronal processing of words between dogs and humans. "Similarly to the case of human infants, we speculate that the similarity of dogs' brain activity for instruction words they know and for similar nonsense words reflects not perceptual constraints but attentional and processing biases. Dogs might not attend to all details of speech sound when they listen to words. Further research could reveal whether this could be a reason that incapacitates dogs from acquiring a sizable vocabulary."- concludes Attila Andics, principal investigator of the MTA-ELTE 'Lendület' Neuroethology of Communication Research Group.

## Wielding a gun makes a shooter perceive others as wielding a gun, too - the “gun embodiment effect” - finds a new randomized controlled trial. Accidental shootings of unarmed victims may sometimes happen because the shooter misperceived the victim as also having a gun.

Summary of [original article](https://natsci.source.colostate.edu/wielding-a-gun-makes-a-shooter-perceive-others-as-wielding-a-gun-too/):

> The researchers found strong evidence that when holding a gun, participants were a little slower to make their judgment about whether the other person was also holding a gun. "It's as if, when they're holding a gun, they are prone to see a gun," Witt said. If 100 officers wielding guns interact with 10 unarmed people a day for 100 days, in these 100,000 interactions, our data suggest there were will be 1,000 misperceptions of an unarmed person as holding a gun."

> "accidental shootings" are not accidental if the victims armament is a question. You chose to shoot someone and perhaps you were wrong about them, but you didn't shoot them by accident.

## Religious discrimination particularly high for Jews and Muslims research shows. While 8.7% of all the people surveyed reported being threatened with physical violence due to their religion, threats were reported by 16.7% of Jews and 20.3% of Muslims.

Summary of [original article](https://news.rice.edu/2020/12/09/religious-discrimination-particularly-high-for-jews-and-muslims-study-shows/):

> Although people of all faiths report growing religious discrimination during the past few years, the phenomenon is most common among Jews and Muslims, according to a new study from researchers at Rice University and West Virginia University. Jews and Muslims were also more likely to report religious harassment, threats and violence. Muslims and Jews were also the most likely to report organizational discrimination.

## Honey bees use animal feces as a tool to defend colonies against group attack by giant hornets, the first report of tool use by honey bees and the first evidence that they forage for solids that are not derived from plants.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242668):

> In summary, we have documented fecal spotting as a novel defensive behavior that is used by Apis cerana honey bees to defend their nests against attack by the giant hornet Vespa soror, a poorly studied but formidable vespid that employs a mass-attack strategy similar to that used by its better-known sister species, V. mandarinia. What evolutionary steps underpinned the switch to foraging for filth in the context of collecting tools for predator defense? What properties of feces provide A. cerana colonies with a measure of protection against V. soror attacks? How is spotting behavior organized within A. cerana workforces? Despite exerting enormous selective pressure on honey bees as one of their most deadly predators, remarkably little is understood about how V. soror or V. mandarinia workers recruit nestmates or coordinate their attacks. We allowed hornets to continue to visit "Attacked" colonies, but for the second and third days thereafter, hornets were waved away from all colonies to determine the persistence of an attacked colony's spotting response in the absence of further attack.

## New study is the first to demonstrate that honey bees use a contagious warning signal to deter attacking hornets, that even "murder" hornets recognize, that can lead to a counter attack in which bees surrounds the hornet, forming a "heat ball" that mixes heat, CO2 and stinging against the hornet.

Summary of [original article](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/i-see-you-honey-bees-use-contagious-and-honest-visual-signal-to-deter-attacking-hornets):

> A signal from colony guard bees lets hornets know that their attack plans have been exposed, and also sends an alarm across the bee colony communicating that urgent reinforcements are needed due to the impending danger. University of California San Diego biologists studying Asian honey bees and hornets have produced new research that deconstructs this ISY signal and shows for the first time that it is visually driven and contagious across the bee colony. "The beauty of the ISY signal is that hornets are only deterred if enough defending bees quickly gather to synchronously produce the signal, thereby showing the hornet that further attack is futile," said study senior author James Nieh, a professor in the Section of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution in UC San Diego's Division of Biological Sciences.

## To actually keep your New Year’s resolution, the largest study ever conducted recommends you avoid quitting things, and instead, choose to start new habits.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/largest-study-on-new-years-resolutions-explained):

> New research reveals how to avoid the typical drop-off and design a New Year's resolution that actually sticks. According to the largest study on New Year's resolutions to date, people who create resolutions that add behaviors rather than erase them are more likely to maintain them for a year. Forty-four percent of Americans report being likely or very likely to make a New Year's resolution for the coming year.

> Considering that you, me and the entire universe are made of atoms and given the sheer size and fluidity of the universe, I find it extremely likely that at some point of floating around and bumping into each other, a pair of atoms might just find themselves forming bonds that would ultimately give rise to a molecule and that those molecules would eventually, again given enough time to float and bump, form a compound that could itself also give rise to something we could consider to be alive.
