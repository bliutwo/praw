## Manatee deaths in Florida point to a global decline in seagrass ecosystems. Drivers of this die-off include algal blooms, destructive fishing and boating practices, and the warmer, more acidic waters of climate change.

Summary of [original article](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/09/manatee-deaths-in-florida-point-to-a-global-decline-in-seagrass-ecosystems/):

> "Scientists have said time and time again that seagrass is declining, that there is a hell of a lot of nutrients in these waters, that there's a big problem here that needs to be solved," said Benjamin Jones, a seagrass ecologist and co-founder of the U.K.-based research organization Project Seagrass, in an interview with Mongabay. Wildlife officers suspect the mass death is linked to the dieback of seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon, a major overwintering location for the Florida manatee, and where most of the deaths occurred. "Part of the big problem with seagrass is that no one strategy works for everywhere, really," said Jones, whose research has focused on seagrass meadows both in the U.K. and in the Indo-Pacific.

## Wolf Populations Drop as More States Allow Hunting: Repercussions of planned and anticipated wolf hunts and traps could ripple through ecosystems for years to come, scientists say

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wolf-populations-drop-as-more-states-allow-hunting/):

> Meanwhile Montana and Idaho, whose wolf populations have been delisted since 2011, have loosened restrictions: In April Montana legalized the use of snares to capture wolves, and in May Idaho passed a law allowing the cull of 90% of the state's population by nearly all means, including shooting from helicopters or ATVs. Even if none of the hunted wolves in February were pregnant, normal levels of breeding in the remaining females might not be enough to keep the population stable, says Adrian Wydeven, a retired wildlife biologist who worked for the state of Wisconsin for more than three decades. In the plan, that number was meant to serve as the minimum amount of wolves for researchers to aim for before the state could consider any hunting of the animals first place, not as an ideal population size, he says.

> If only we had an ecosystem in the US that could show the harm it does. Maybe like one in the Pacific  northwest that has started to get their wolf numbers back to normal and could show how beneficial it is. If only......

## Rheumatoid arthritis linked with gut bacteria imbalance

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/rheumatoid-arthritis-leaky-gut-bacteria-microbiome/):

> Impressive new research led by a team from University College London is suggesting bacterial imbalances in the gut microbiome may play a major role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. For some time now researchers have reported consistent links between gut microbiome abnormalities and rheumatoid arthritis, and increasing populations of certain types of bad bacteria have frequently been associated with arthritis severity. "Researchers at University College London have shown that, in arthritis, there is profound damage to the gut lining, which fails to work properly as a barrier, as well as an accumulation in the gut of white blood cells that cause inflammation," the authors write in the newly published study.

## Scientists have observed wild cockatoos making their own cutlery set—crafting the equivalent of a crowbar, an ice pick, and a spoon to pry open one of their favorite fruits. Discovery puts parrots on par with primates in terms of toolmaking.

> What 3-year-old has made their own cutlery set? Scientists have observed wild cockatoos, members of the parrot family, crafting the equivalent of a crowbar, an ice pick, and a spoon to pry open one of their favorite fruits. The scientists spent almost 900 hours looking up to watch wild cockatoos feed, but didn't witness tool use. Then one day in June 2019, while watching wild cockatoos in the forest, O'Hara noticed fruit on the ground with cockatoo bitemarks.

## Plant-based diets cause men to fart more and have larger stools, researchers have found – but that seems to be a good thing, because it means these foods are promoting healthy gut bacteria.

Summary of [original article](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082638):

> Our aim was to determine the effect of diet on gut microbiota, digestive function and sensations, using an integrated clinical, metagenomics and metabolomics approach. We conducted a cross-over, randomised study on the effects of a Western-type diet versus a fibre-enriched Mediterranean diet. As compared to a Western diet, the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher number of anal gas evacuations, sensation of flatulence and borborygmi, larger volume of gas after the meal and larger colonic content.

## Your Asthma Might Get Worse At Night Because Of Circadian Rhythms, New Study In Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Suggest

> Anecdotally, I find that my asthma at night can be minimised but not completely prevented by keeping the bedroom extremely dust free.
> 
> Scientifically, after researching the links between the circadian clock and cancer for my PhD, the circadian clock is intimately linked to many physiological processes. Our circadian clock and the genes that encode it have been conserved over billions of years--cyanobacteria 2 billion years ago, for example, could use this to perform DNA replication during the night to avoid DNA damage during replication caused by ultraviolet light.
> 
> It absolutely makes sense that as this cycle is intertwined into many different physiological pathways it could have an impact on asthma symptoms, and the authors point to this causal link

> >We observed that those people who have the worst asthma in general are the ones who suffer from the greatest circadian-induced drops in pulmonary function at night

## Exercise modifies the microbiome even in the absence of dietary changes

Summary of [original article](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/8/2839/htm):

> Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of 10-week moderate aerobic exercise on the cardiorespiratory fitness and gut bacteria composition of non-obese men with the same nutritional profile. Here, we show results from a controlled and randomized study that investigated the effect of a 10-week period of aerobic exercise on the gut bacteria composition of apparently healthy and sedentary young men. Our results suggest that 10 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise at moderate intensity was able to increase the VO2peak which, along with BMI, showed association with gut bacteria composition in previously sedentary, young, non-obese men who had maintained a balanced consumption of nutrients.

> 
> Also, does general activity affect it? For example, what if I do not run for 30 minutes but I walk like 15 km a day?
