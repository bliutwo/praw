## Experimental gene therapy cures children born without an immune system. Autologous ex vivo gene therapy with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector restored immune function in 48/50 children with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), with no complications.

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/gene-therapy-for-children-born-without-immune-system):

> An experimental form of gene therapy developed by a team of researchers from UCLA and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London has successfully treated 48 of 50 children born with a rare and deadly inherited disorder that leaves them without an immune system. The investigational gene therapy method involves first collecting some of the child's blood-forming stem cells, which have the potential to create all types of blood and immune cells. ADA-SCID patients began receiving the new gene therapy at GOSH in 2012; the following year, the experimental treatment was offered at UCLA and the NIH. "More than 200 patients with various genetic conditions across the world have now been treated with experimental lentiviral gene therapies, and applying gene therapy to ADA-SCID is another significant scientific advance," said Thrasher, a senior author of the study who is also a professor of pediatric immunology at GOSH. Ten of the children in the UCLA study were treated using a frozen preparation of corrected stem cells.

## Women get criticized for their ambition and are subtly encouraged to be more “feminine” at work, a new study of workplace dynamics found, which examined the backlash effect — the idea that women face repercussions for behaving in a “masculine” way, including displaying ambition at work.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/men-get-more-constructive-criticism-at-work-and-they-get-more-upset-about-it/):

> Women get dinged for their ambition and subtly encouraged to be more "Feminine" even when they're still low-ranking at work, while men get much more upset when they're criticized, a new analysis of workplace dynamics found. Based on prior research, Ciancetta expected to find that women in leadership positions would face more criticism for displaying more agency, but she found no relationship between seniority and criticism. Notably, men reported feeling much more upset when they were criticized at work, suggesting they were far more sensitive than women.

> In my very personal experience, this has been around for at least 40 years. I defied this "directive" and often suffered veiled and very direct criticism, as well as punitive behavior. I have never understood it. No man would ever have been censured or penalized for my behavior in the same job.

## A new study on air pollution and agriculture finds "dietary shifts toward more plant-based foods that maintain protein intake and other nutritional needs could reduce agricultural air quality-related mortality by 68 to 83 percent."

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/air-pollution-agriculture-connection):

> The study team hopes their research inspires policymakers, regulators, and farmers to take action to curb air pollution - and save lives. Switching to poultry-based diets can reduce annual deaths driven by agricultural air pollution by 40 percent. Dietary shifts toward more plant-based foods that maintain protein intake and other nutritional needs could reduce agricultural air quality-related mortality by 68 to 83%. In sum, improved livestock and fertilization practices, and dietary shifts could greatly decrease the health impacts of agriculture caused by its contribution to reduced air quality.

> After a life-time of enjoying meat, I recently tried some plant-based foods.  I tried a few burgers, kievs, southern-style "steaks", and meatless cocktail sausages.
> 
> The verdict is, I'm going to severely, severely cut down on my meat intake.  Yes, the plant-based stuff tastes different, but it's fine - I made a cheeseburger with a plant-based burger, and it wouldn't have tasted out of place at a barbeque, if you hadn't been told.  These products taste different, but it's dawned on me that the "difference" between the two types of food just isn't worth the misery we put millions of animals through, or the environmental damage we're inflicting on the world.

## Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have developed a new material that prevents infections in wounds - a specially designed hydrogel, that works against all types of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant ones

> Their antimicrobial results are really quite concerning for a number of reasons. Firstly, I do a ton of antimicrobial assays. Not sure why they are staining to measure the live vs dead on the surface rather than growing the supernatant overnight to count colonies. Their error bars are just wacky for this kind of work. They have quite a lot of dead bacteria in the control test (when F127 has been show to support bacterial colonies before), and never manage to kill >99% of bacteria after 24 hours. A bit surprised this made it through peer review with the figures looking like that, I would have certainly flagged it as they dont discuss very thoroughly why its so poor and SD is so huge. 
> 
> This is neat, but its not groundbreaking. I wonder what the peptide costs as adding more of that might have helped their antimicrobial results.
> 
> Edit: Because this gained a bit of traction, this work is fine. Its very iterative, using a known antimicrobial and a known hydrogel material. They arent the first to do this, they arent the best, and they wont be the last. Nice their university is getting behind them with a press release. Numbers are wonky, but the idea is solid. Redditors who dont read the article will make some sarcastic joke about big pharma or mass effect, scientists in the field will nod and go back to procrastinating on their own research.

## A study has revealed that bats know the speed of sound from birth. Researchers raised bats from birth in a helium-enriched environment (speed of sound is higher than normal). They found that bats map the world in units of time. For example, a bat perceives an insect as being at a distance of 9ms.
