## Clinical trial finds that vaping CBD-dominant cannabis doesn’t impair driving or produce significant cognitive or psychomotor impairment. Although CBD alone doesn’t lead to the feeling of euphoria, its calming effect makes it useful for treating anxiety, depression and seizures.

## Providing workers with a universal basic income did not reduce productivity or the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.

> The term "universal basic income" doesn't seem correct. The UBI would imply that the researchers would pay the people the same amount of money whether or not they chose to show up to do the tasks not whether they do the tasks better or worse. Every student had to participate in the experiment. This is more comparable to salary vs commission based employment.

## New study suggests that college campuses are COVID-19 superspreaders

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/tfg-nss011121.php):

> College campuses are at risk of becoming COVID-19 superspreaders for their entire county, according to a new vast study which shows the striking danger of the first two weeks of school in particular. Looking at 30 campuses across the nation with the highest amount of reported cases, experts saw that over half of the institutions had spikes - at their peak - which were well above 1,000 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per week within the first two weeks of class. "Our results confirm the widespread fear in early fall that colleges could become the new hot spots of COVID-19 transmission. But, at the same time, college administrators should be applauded for their rapid responses to successfully manage local outbreaks."

> The University my son attends has been monitoring the waste stream from the Dorms.  When they detect COVID in a Dorm, they go to Lock Down and test everyone in the dorm then move anyone infected to an isolation facility for treatment.

> Most of his classes have been online and he’s studying IT so he thankfully doesn’t interact directly with too many people.

## Women who are young, “conventionally attractive” and appear and act feminine are more likely to be believed when making accusations of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment often stems from hostility toward women, the desire to dominate women, or backlash against women who violate gender norms.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/01/14/sexual-harassment-claims-considered-more-credible-if-made-by-prototypical-women/):

> The overall results were clear: Participants generally perceived sexual harassment victims to be prototypical women. The association between sexual harassment and prototypical women is so strong that the exact same woman was seen as more prototypical when people were told she was sexually harassed. Because white women are perceived as prototypical women, the researchers are currently exploring whether Black women are perceived as less credible and less harmed by sexual harassment.

`/u/ForceBru` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kyh9dj/women_who_are_young_conventionally_attractive_and/):

> So this is about who people _think_ is being harassed.  Is there any similar research about what kind of women are _actually_ being harassed?

## Herd immunity by infection is not an option

Summary of [original article](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abf7921):

> Manaus provides a cautionary example of unmitigated spread across a population, showing that herd immunity is likely not achieved even at high levels of infection and that it comes with unacceptably high costs. Although some have suggested that there may be a degree of preexisting cross-reactive T cell and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and that a lower proportion of infection of only 10 to 40% of the population could achieve herd immunity, the study of Buss et al. Definitively show is that pursuing herd immunity through naturally acquired infection is not a strategy that can be considered.

## Raising the minimum wage by $1 reduces the teen birth rate by 3%, according to a new study examining U.S. state-level data.

Summary of [original article](https://www.academictimes.com/raising-minimum-wage-lowers-teen-births/):

> Raising the minimum wage corresponds to a significant drop in the teenage birth rate, according to a new study of state-level U.S. data that sheds light on the unexpected benefits of putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers. An increase in the minimum wage also led to a smaller - but still statistically significant - drop in births by women aged 20 to 39, indicating that wages affects fertility overall rather than delaying the age at which women have children. While supporters of raising the minimum wage often argue in strictly economic terms, Lenhart said that the connection between the policy and other health benefits bolsters their arguments.

`/u/Merit_based_only` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ky4xb3/raising_the_minimum_wage_by_1_reduces_the_teen/):

> "My analysis shows that the effects are driven by states that also have state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) laws in place. Furthermore, I show that minimum wages are also associated with a 2.9 percent decline in birth rates among women aged 20 to 24, and with smaller but statistically significant declines in birth rates for women between the ages 25 to 39. These findings suggest that, rather than delaying childbearing age, minimum wage reduce overall birth rates."

> Having only read the abstract, I can't state this firmly, but the thesis of the paper looks like one hell of a reach to me.

## Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown that a relatively simple and rapid blood test can predict -- within a day of a hospital admission -- which patients with COVID-19 are at highest risk of severe complications or death.

Summary of [original article](https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/rapid-blood-test-identifies-covid-19-patients-at-high-risk-of-severe-disease/):

> A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggests that measuring mitochondrial DNA in the blood of patients with COVID-19 can help predict which patients are at highest risk of severe disease, requiring more intensive care. Now, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have shown that a relatively simple and rapid blood test can predict - within a day of a hospital admission - which patients with COVID-19 are at highest risk of severe complications or death. "We will need larger trials to verify what we found in this study, but if we could determine in the first 24 hours of admission whether a patient is likely to need dialysis or intubation or medication to keep their blood pressure from dropping too low, that would change how we triage the patient, and it might change how we manage them much earlier in the disease course," said co-senior author Hrishikesh S. Kulkarni, MD, an assistant professor of medicine.

`/u/Wagamaga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kye6ze/scientists_at_washington_university_school_of/):

> One of the most vexing aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is doctors’ inability to predict which newly hospitalized patients will go on to develop severe disease, including complications that require the insertion of a breathing tube, kidney dialysis or other intensive care. Knowledge of a patient’s age and underlying medical conditions can help predict such outcomes, but there are still surprises when younger, seemingly healthier patients suffer severe complications that can lead to death.

## Electronic monitoring is more effective than prison at reducing recidivism. Compared with prison, electronic monitoring reduces the cumulative number of offenses by 45% 10 years after sentencing.
