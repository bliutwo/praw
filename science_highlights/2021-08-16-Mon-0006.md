## Long COVID and Severe Infections Associated with Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation - "We found over 73% of COVID-19 patients who were experiencing long Covid symptoms were also positive for EBV reactivation", said lead study author Jeffrey Gold.

Summary of [original article](https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/577831-Long-COVID-and-Severe-Infections-Associated-with-Epstein-Barr-Virus-Reactivation/):

> "We ran Epstein-Barr virus serological tests on COVID-19 patients at least 90 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparing EBV reactivation rates of those with long COVID symptoms to those who never experienced long COVID symptoms," said lead study author Jeffrey Gold of World Organization. According to Gold, more than 95% of health adults will test positive for latent EBV infection, identified by testing for the presence of EBV VCA IgG and/or EBV nuclear antigen 1 IgG. EBV reactivation, on the other hand, is identified by further testing for the presence of EBV EA-D IgG, EBV VCA IgM, and/or circulating EBV DNA. "We found similar rates of EBV reactivation in those who had long COVID symptoms for months, as in those with long COVID symptoms that began just weeks after testing positive for COVID-19. This indicated to us that EBV reactivation likely occurs simultaneously or soon after COVID-19 infection," said David Hurley, a professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia and coauthor of the Pathogens study. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and EBV reactivation described in these studies open up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of initial COVID-19 infection as well as long COVID. The researchers of the study in Pathogens indicated that it may be prudent to test patients newly positive for COVID-19 for evidence of EBV reactivation indicated by positive EBV EA-D IgG, EBV VCA IgM, or serum EBV DNA tests.

> oh this is something that was being discussed last year, and I hoped wouldn't be the case. Unfortunately this means it resembles many cases of chronic fatigue syndrome.  It does appear that CFS is caused in some cases by EBV virus reactivation, initial infection, or 'partial' reactivation, where partially inactivated EBV contained in longer lived immune cells (possibly such as memory B cells that live in the bone marrow) are reactivated by certain triggers, leading to immune responses.)
> 
> According to one scientist working on CFS, EBV virus in CFS is usually retained in an inactivated form (a consequence of antiviral mechanisms such as RNase L) but enough can remain to cause the production of certain proteins that do harmful things in the immune response. This reactivation of herpesviruses is normally triggered by such things as cell repair pathways, gene repair, changes in reduced glutathione, nf-kappa b activation and so forth, and can act as an inflammatory feedback. Coupled with the possibility that memory immune cells are poorly targeted or prone to produce autoimmune antibodies then you can see why reactivation in cell subsets such as memory B cells (in theory), could result in prolonged symptoms of illness.

> 
> Just as inflammation can trigger EBV and all herpes family viruses to reactivate, so too does inflammtory signalling cause long lived memory B cells to enter circulation and pump out antibodies, an issue particularly if they are the wrong ones as a result of autoantibodies or the products of superantigens possibly produced by SARS-Cov-2 to cause indiscriminate antibody production..

> I mean.. yeah.

> If you need empirical evidence to believe something, you have more concern over things that are real. If your understandings are based in faith- believing without proof- then anything and everything is both real and not real at the same time and thus you can easily fall into believing anything.
> 
> 
> There's a reason republicans have the largest population of religious nuts and focus on them- because they're so easy to control. If you don't need evidence to build your baseline understanding of reality, you don't need evidence to believe or accept anything- reality can be anything to you, no matter the evidence.

## Hyenas Hoarded Thousands of Human, Animal Bones in Saudi Arabian Lava Tube

Summary of [original article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-uncover-extensive-pile-animal-and-human-bones-saudi-arabia-cave-180978375/):

> Found in the Umm Jirsan lava tube system-a sprawling network of tunnels formed by volcanic activity-the hundreds of thousands of bones belong to at least 14 kinds of animals, including cattle, caprids, horses, camels, rodents and even humans. Lead author Mathew Stewart, a zooarchaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, tells Gizmodo's Isaac Schultz that the team identified hyenas as the culprits after analyzing cuts, bites and digestion marks found on the bones. Happy to introduce the Umm Jirsan lava tube, Saudi Arabia, in our new paper just out in AAS. This 1.5 km long lava tube is chock-a-block with hundreds of thousands of beautifully preserved animal remains.

## Physical Activity Reduces Clinical Symptoms and Restores Neuroplasticity in Major Depression

Summary of [original article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.660642/full):

> The effect of the PA program was compared to a control intervention administered over the same period of time that controlled for investigator-related effects, experience of group cohesion and social interaction, while the patients abstained from additional physical activity. Importantly, the participants of the CI group were not included in other PA programs of the psychiatric clinic, and were instructed not to engage in any physical or sportive activity beyond their routine activity. The correlation of the BDI-II and PAS-induced neuroplasticity might indicate, that factors like loss of interest, indecisiveness and pessimism, which were most strongly reduced in the PA group, might be more closely associated to deficient neuroplasticity and therefore sensitive to plasticity enhancing interventions.

> I do research in this area. Although the overall message has been known for a while (physical activity helps treat depression), it seems like this was a very well run study that did a great job separating the physical activity from the other social and behavioral-activation-type effects.
> 
> So, neat! Always good to have more confirmation in this area.

## New findings show Bennu—one of the most hazardous known asteroids—has a 1 in 1,750 chance of impacting Earth through 2300, higher than previously thought. It could create a crater between 10 to 20 times its size and cause an area of devastation that could reach 100 times the size of the crater.

## American citizens are less likely to support candidates accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment. Democrats are significantly less likely to support such a candidate, but Republicans do not penalize candidates facing such allegations, especially if the candidate is identified as a Republican.

## Antibiotic Novobiocin found to kill tumor cells with DNA-repair glitch - "An antibiotic developed in the 1950s and largely supplanted by newer drugs, effectively targets and kills cancer cells with a common genetic defect."

Summary of [original article](https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2021/antibiotic-novobiocin-found-to-kill-tumor-cells-with-dna-repair-glitch/):

> In a study in the journal Nature Cancer, the researchers found that in laboratory cell lines and tumor models novobiocin selectively killed tumor cells with abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which help repair damaged DNA. The drug was effective even in tumors resistant to agents known as PARP inhibitors, which have become a prime therapy for cancers with DNA-repair glitches. "PARP inhibitors represent an important advance in the treatment of cancers with defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes involved in DNA repair. By allowing tumor cells to accumulate additional genetic damage, they essentially incapacitate the cells and cause them to die," says Alan D'Andrea, MD, director of the Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers and the Center for DNA Damage and Repair at Dana-Farber and co-senior author of the study with Raphael Ceccaldi, PhD, PharmD, of the Curie Institute in Paris. Of the multitude of molecules and drugs tested, one stood out for its ability to kill the tumor cells while leaving normal cells unharmed - novobiocin.
