> The fact that the war on drugs has excluded psychedelic research for mental diseases is pretty god damn heart breaking. In 50 years time we could have developed so many treatments using these compounds.

## Regularly eating a Southern-style diet - - fried foods and sugary drinks - - may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, while routinely consuming a Mediterranean diet may reduce that risk, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/aha-tsd062521.php):

> "Improving one's diet - by eating a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish such as the Mediterranean diet and low in fried foods, organ meats and processed meats, characteristics of the Southern-style dietary pattern, may decrease one's risk for sudden cardiac death," he said. Overall, participants who ate a Southern-style diet most regularly had a 46% higher risk of sudden cardiac death than people who had the least adherence to this dietary pattern. Participants who most closely followed the traditional Mediterranean diet had a 26% lower risk of sudden cardiac death than those with the least adherence to this eating style.

## MDMA is effective for treating PTSD, long-term efficacy data shows

Summary of [original article](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/mdma-ptsd-treatment/):

> Further results continue to demonstrate its effectiveness for treating PTSD.A new study compiling data from six previous trials and looking at the long-term outcomes of midomafetamine treatment found that continued improvements in most patients for more than one year after the treatment ended. The follow-up data showed that 67% of patients no longer met the clinical criteria that would lead to a diagnosis of PTSD more than one year after treatment ended, compared with 56% of patients at the original endpoint of the trials used in this study. This new long-term data add to the evidence of the effectiveness of midomafetamine for treating PTSD and should help the drug gain approval when the Phase III trials have been completed.

`/u/DontSkipYoga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ob7zy4/mdma_is_effective_for_treating_ptsd_longterm/):

> MDMA showed me that love was possible. That feelings in general were possible. It feels like your best friend that you haven't seen in a decade swam across an ocean to surprise you on your birthday. It's the moment you open the door and see them dripping wet with a smile and a present. This feeling has lasted with me for years and helped me take actions towards living my life in a fulfilling way. One experience saved my life. Yes you always have to work on yourself and put effort in, but MDMA paved my path.

## New research finds that after the Fukushima disaster the absence of humans and the sudden release of pigs led to new boar-pig hybrids, which now make up 16% of the feral herd. Boar expansion was overall driven by the disaster, warming temperatures, and fewer predators.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/abandoned-places-fukushima-boars):

> The researchers analyzed the boar populations in the evacuation zone of Fukushima, finding that 31 wild boar, or 16 percent of the population, were hybrids of pure wild boar and domestic pigs. "While we suggest from the genetic data that the boar expanded north as temperatures warmed and predators went extinct in Japan, we also believe that the wild boar expansion increased after the Fukushima event," Anderson says. What's next for the boars - Due to the low percentage of pig DNA in these boar hybrids, the researchers aren't very hopeful that these individuals will remain hybrids in the long run.

`/u/stellarfury` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oaxk7u/new_research_finds_that_after_the_fukushima/):

> >Research suggests these wild boars are “relatively” radioactive, and there have been efforts to kill and remove them from the region.

> Best line in the article. How do you defend yourself from 30-50 feral radioactive pigs?

## Trump’s support is uniquely tied to animus toward minority groups. Animus towards Democratic Party-aligned minority groups in 2011 predicts support for Donald Trump in the future. This animus does not predict future support for other Republican or Democratic politicians or either party.

## Regular physical activity cuts the risk of dying from infectious diseases such as COVID-19 by 37 per cent and reduces the chance of catching the virus by 31 per cent, according to new global research.

Summary of [original article](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/theuniversity/universitynews/2021-physicalactivitycutscovid-19risk/):

> Regular physical activity cuts the risk of dying from infectious diseases such as COVID-19 by 37 per cent and reduces the chance of catching the virus by 31 per cent, according to new global research. The research entitled 'Effects of regular physical activity on the immune system, vaccination and risk of community acquired infectious disease in the general population: Systematic review and meta-analysis' has been published in the Sports Medicine journal. "The promotion of physical activity and access for all to physical activity pursuit are paramount. Campaigns to inform the public of the benefit of physical activity in fighting the pandemic should be undertaken."
