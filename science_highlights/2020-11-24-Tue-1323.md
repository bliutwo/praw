## Dolphins can consciously slow down their hearts before diving, and can even adjust their heart rate depending on how long they plan to dive for. The findings provide new insights into how marine mammals conserve oxygen and adjust to pressure while diving to avoid “the bends”.

> Dolphins actively slow down their hearts before diving, and can even adjust their heart rate depending on how long they plan to dive for, a new study suggests. "Dolphins have the capacity to vary their reduction in heart rate as much as you and I are able to reduce how fast we breathe", suggests Fahlman. "The close relationship between the trainers and animals is hugely important when training dolphins to participate in scientific studies", explains Andy Jabas, Dolphin Care Specialist at Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat at the Mirage, Las Vegas, United States, home of the dolphins studied here.

> they "avoid the bends" by not breathing high pressure air/nitrogen so their tissues and blood stream never get super saturated with nitrogen. 
> 
> could anyone explain how any air breathing aquatic animal *could* get the bends without using SCUBA gear?

## Financial payments from the drug industry to U.S. physicians was associated with increased prescribing of the paying drug company's drug. The association was consistent across all studies and several studies presented evidence that the association was not correlation, but causation.

## Young kids believe that YouTube videos are better for learning than TV shows or videos created on a researcher’s smartphone. They also view people in YouTube videos to be more real than those on TV but less real than those featured in a researcher-created smartphone video.

## Scientists showed that glycine, the simplest amino acid and an important building block of life, can form in dense interstellar clouds well before they transform into new stars and planets. Glycine can form on the surface of icy dust grains, in the absence of energy, through ‘dark chemistry'.

> “Dark chemistry refers to chemistry without the need of energetic radiation. In the laboratory we were able to simulate the conditions in dark interstellar clouds where cold dust particles are covered by thin layers of ice and subsequently processed by impacting atoms causing precursor species to fragment and reactive intermediates to recombine.”
