## US shadow banks, such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund firms, have worsened hardship and inequality during the COVID-19 crisis. Shadow banks are shifting investments in ways that profit on the misfortunes of frontline workers, vulnerable populations, and distressed industries.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00027642211003162):

> The coronavirus crisis occurred at a moment when grocery store jobs have become scarcer and less secure, making it difficult for workers to mobilize for protection from the health risks of working during the pandemic. While investors have provided crucial funding for companies delivering health care innovations, protective equipment, home delivery, and remote work, shadow banks have invested in ways that also exploit the vulnerabilities and inequalities laid bare by the crisis. Shadow banks have helped to create the conditions that made frontline workers vulnerable in the first place: Their long history of predatory financial behavior has contributed to precarious working conditions and growing economic inequality.

> I’m sorry, but you’re not a “shadow bank“ unless you borrow short and lend long like conventional banks do, but you aren’t subject to the same regulations. Some venture-capital and private equity firms have that kind of capital structure, but many don’t. Not every institution you don’t like is a “shadow bank“. We have to be careful about our terms.

## A one‐semester course for high school students regarding happiness and well‐being demonstrated significant changes in positive attitudes, affective balance, and knowledge about happiness.

Summary of [original article](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12419):

> To test the impact of a one‐semester active learning curriculum covering the modern science and philosophy of well‐being and happiness on attitudinal measures related to the curriculum and standard measures of depression and well‐being. Students completed questionnaires pre‐ and post‐semester including a Positive Attitude Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale, Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and a test of knowledge about well‐being. A one‐semester course for high school students regarding well‐being and happiness demonstrated significant changes in positive attitudes, affective balance, and knowledge about happiness.

> I often wondered why psychology wasn't taught to preteens. Seems like you'd want the tools before the work.

## Immigrants act more as job creators than job takers: Researchers found that immigrants not only expand labor supply as workers but also expand labor demand as founders of firms, and do so at much higher rates than their native-born counterparts.

> I don't doubt that immigrants are more likely to establish new businesses compared to locals: There must be a correlation between risk-taking behaviour & establishing businesses & moving to a new country. 
> 
> Also, a lot of times, immigrants are forced to do so as they don't have contacts in their newly adopted country to get into an established business: It can be easier for me to open up a kebab shop rather than getting back into the marketing business I had been running back in the home country.

## UC Berkeley chemists synthesized a flexible polymer membrane incorporating nanoparticles called “porous aromatic frameworks.” The membrane selectively absorbs nearly 100% of metals such as mercury, copper, or iron during desalination, more efficiently producing clean, safe water.

Summary of [original article](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/04/29/desalination-removes-toxic-metals/):

> Desalination - the removal of salt - is only one step in the process of producing drinkable water, or water for agriculture or industry, from ocean water or wastewater. Now, a UC Berkeley-led research team in collaboration with Berkeley Lab has discovered a way to simplify the removal of toxic metals, like mercury and boron, during desalination to produce clean water, while at the same time potentially capturing valuable metals, such as gold. The new technique, which can easily be added to current membrane-based electrodialysis desalination processes, removes nearly 100% of these toxic metals, producing a pure brine along with pure water and isolating the valuable metals for later use or disposal.

> Nice!
> 
> Did a research paper in high school on desalination. 
> 
> I know it is a problem of scaling up the tech and operation, but it has always bugged me that we cant simply MAKE fresh water using ocean water and desalination plants.

## Republicans Became More Vaccine Hesitant as the Coronavirus Pandemic Unfolded. Republicans consistently viewed the virus to be less threatening than Democrats. Among Democrats, the perceived threat of COVID-19 grew greater with time, while there was no change among Republicans.

Summary of [original article](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/republicans-became-more-vaccine-hesitant-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfolded):

> Individuals who self-identify as Republicans became more skeptical of a potential COVID-19 vaccine and other inoculations, such as the flu shot, over the course of the pandemic, reveals a new study by the University of California San Diego's Rady School of Management. "We found Republicans became increasingly vaccine hesitant and less trusting of media from March to August of 2020, while Democrats' views on the two topics stayed the same," said lead author Ariel Fridman, a PhD candidate in behavioral marketing at the Rady School. A Monmouth poll earlier in April showed that 36 percent of Republicans said they had received at least one shot of the vaccine - compared with 67 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Independents - and 43 percent of Republicans said they would likely never get the vaccine.

`/u/1_falc0n` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n10xyq/republicans_became_more_vaccine_hesitant_as_the/):

> The people who underestimate the threat of COVID-19 are the same people who overestimate the potential risks of receiving a vaccine for it.

## Reducing blue light with a new type of LED that won't keep you up all night - Researchers have developed a prototype LED that reduces, instead of masks, the blue component, while also making colors appear just as they do in natural sunlight.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/acs-rbl042821.php):

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article. (ERROR: <class 'json.decoder.JSONDecodeError'>)

`/u/Panoramic_Vacuum` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n0rmsc/reducing_blue_light_with_a_new_type_of_led_that/):

> It sounds like what this new LED has done is shift the primary LED wavelength further to the "violet" side of the spectrum (short wavelength) far enough that it is outside the peak circadian sensitivity zone in the "blue" part of the visible spectrum (~480nm).  Right now most LEDs used with phosphor technology are "royal blue" which emit a wavelength close to the sensitive 480nm zone.
> 
> I'm curious as to the claim that it can render colors similar to natural sunlight because that's really a tall order.  There are hardly any phosphor compositions right now that can mimic natural light without significant doping in certain areas of the spectrum (which in turn increases the production cost of said LEDs over the standard phosphor coating).  I'd love to see their gamut area index for this new phosphor to see how it compares to other LED sources.
