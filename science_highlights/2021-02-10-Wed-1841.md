## Singapore, with almost 200,00 migrant workers exposed to COVID-19 and more than 111,000 confirmed infections, has had only 20 ICU patients and 1 death, because of highly effective mass testing, contact tracing and isolation, finds a new study in JAMA.

> This doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. It claims that contact tracing resulted in only 20 ICU cases and 1 death out of 100,000+ cases. 
> 
> Contact tracing would reduce the total amount of infections but it can’t possibly reduce the severity of them.
> 
> I think they ignored far more likely factors, such as the fact that migrant workers in Singapore will tend to be young, and also the fact that most people in SE Asia are thin.

## The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming by 2100 to below 2 °C, but the probability of this is only 5% based on current trends. To have an even chance of staying below 2 °C, country-based rate of emissions reductions should increase by 80% beyond nationally determined contributions.

## Antidepressant drug Paroxetine found to be a disease-modifying treatment for Osteoarthritis

Summary of [original article](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/580/eaau8491):

> The protective effect demonstrated by GRK2 conditional deletion suggests a main role for GRK2-mediated GPCR desensitization in cartilage degeneration and loss of chondrocyte anabolic activity during PTOA progression and presents GRK2 as a therapeutic target for OA.Paroxetine-mediated GRK2 inhibition normalizes chondrocyte cAMP content, decelerates OA progression, and promotes an anabolic chondrocyte phenotypeTo determine whether pharmacologic GRK2 inhibition can prevent or decelerate OA progression in the DMM model, we used paroxetine, an SSRI with a direct and selective GRK2 inhibitory effect. Paroxetine inhibits CH and promotes cAMP production in human OA cartilageWe investigated the efficacy of pharmacological inhibitors of GRK2 in clinical OA by examining the effect of paroxetine and gallein on ex vivo cultured human osteochondral plugs obtained from patients with OA. Treatment of osteochondral plugs with paroxetine or gallein reduced GRK2 protein expression, whereas GRK2 mRNA expression was not affected. Together, we provide evidence for GRK2-mediated GPCR desensitization as a pathological driver of CH and cartilage degeneration in OA.Paroxetine is an SSRI and a potent GRK2 inhibitor with higher selectivity for GRK2 over other GRKs. Similar to conditional KO of GRK2, paroxetine-mediated inhibition of GRK2 prevented GPCR desensitization, exerting chondroprotective and matrix-regenerative effects in DMM mice.

## Drinking green tea, coffee lowers risk of death for stroke and heart attack survivors

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/aha-dgt020121.php):

> DALLAS, Feb. 4, 2021 - Stroke and heart attack survivors can reduce multiple causes of death and prevent further cardiovascular events by drinking green tea, according to new research published today in Stroke, a journal of the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association. Researchers in the study "Green tea and coffee consumption and all-cause mortality among persons with and without stroke or myocardial infarction" sought to determine the effects of green tea and coffee consumption after surviving a stroke or heart attack. When compared with participants who rarely drank green tea, stroke survivors who consumed at least seven cups of green tea daily lowered their risk of all-cause mortality by approximately 62%. Researchers did not observe a statistically significant association among participants without a history of stroke or heart attack.

## Utility companies have worried that solar panels drive up electric costs for the people who don't have panels. Research shows the opposite is actually true -- grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) owners are actually subsidizing their non-PV neighbors.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/mtu-sal020921.php):

> "Anyone who puts up solar is being a great citizen for their neighbors and for their local utility," Pearce said, noting that when someone puts up grid-tied solar panels, they are essentially investing in the grid itself. "Customers with solar distributed generation are making it so utility companies don't have to make as many infrastructure investments, while at the same time solar shaves down peak demands when electricity is the most expensive." Each component of the value has a sensitivity analysis run on the core variables and these sensitivities are applied for the total value of solar.

## Mouse study found offspring born to stressed fathers had different gene expressions in certain areas of the brain. These changes were linked back to tweaks in the small RNAs in sperm. Research adds to our understanding of how epigenetic changes may influence mental health.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/mental-health-sperm-study):

> A study in mice, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, shines a light on the importance of studying how epigenetic changes - traits that are acquired during a lifetime, influenced by behavior and environment - may factor into mental health. "The paternal effects of epigenetics on offspring appear to be almost Lamarckian," Anthony Hannan, head of the Epigenetics and Neural Plasticity Laboratory at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Victoria, Australia, tells Inverse. Overall, the findings reveal a causal role of sperm miRNAs in the inheritance of depression and provide insight into the mechanism underlying susceptibility to depression.

## Sending signals into spinal cord could restart breathing during opioid overdoses

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/sending-signals-into-spinal-cord-restarts-rat-breathing-during-opioid-overdoses/):

> Researchers restored the respiration of rats undergoing opioid overdoses by sending a pair of high-frequency signals into their spinal cords, triggering neurons responsible for breathing with a recently invented approach to manipulating brain cells. Restored the respiration of rats undergoing opioid overdoses by sending a pair of high-frequency signals into their spinal cords, triggering neurons responsible for breathing with a recently invented approach to manipulating brain cells. Led by former Florida Ph.D. student Michael Sunshine, the researchers used temporal-interference stimulation on the spinal cords of rats during opioid overdoses to control their diaphragms and induce breathing.

> 
> Abstract: 
> 
>  Respiratory insufficiency is a leading cause of death due to drug overdose or neuromuscular disease. We hypothesized that a stimulation paradigm using temporal interference (TI) could restore breathing in such conditions. Following opioid overdose in rats, two high frequency (5000 Hz and 5001 Hz), low amplitude waveforms delivered via intramuscular wires in the neck immediately activated the diaphragm and restored ventilation in phase with waveform offset (1 Hz or 60 breaths/min). Following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), TI stimulation via dorsally placed epidural electrodes uni- or bilaterally activated the diaphragm depending on current and electrode position. In silico modeling indicated that an interferential signal in the ventral spinal cord predicted the evoked response (left versus right diaphragm) and current-ratio-based steering. We conclude that TI stimulation can activate spinal motor neurons after SCI and prevent fatal apnea during drug overdose by restoring ventilation with minimally invasive electrodes.
