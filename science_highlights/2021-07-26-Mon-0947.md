## Just 5% of the world’s power plants account for almost three-quarters of carbon emissions from electricity generation. A crackdown on a limited number of ‘hyper-emitting’ power plants could yield outsize cuts in the carbon emissions resulting from global electricity generation.

## Even in the absence of bark beetle outbreaks and wildfire, trees in Colorado subalpine forests are dying at increasing rates from warmer and drier summer conditions, found recent University of Colorado Boulder research.

> >With temperatures in Colorado having risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1980s and increasing more quickly at higher elevations, estimates of another possible 2.5 or more degrees of warming in the next few decades due to climate change indicate that the rate of tree deaths will only increase.

> And
> 
> >They found that tree mortality increased from .26% per year during 1982 to 1993, to .82% per year during 2008 to 2019--more than tripling within 40 years.
> 
> Sample size, sample areas, and rainfall would have a large effect that is not discussed. 2F is really not much. It's more about how much longer higher temps are present, which is not discussed. This really seems like a poorly researched topic, which is unusual for the Boulder mountain sciences program.

## Extreme heat, dry summers main cause of tree death in Colorado’s subalpine forests. Researchers found tree mortality in subalpine Colorado forests not affected by fire or bark beetle outbreaks in the last decade has more than tripled since the 1980s.

> 
> The study, published in February in the Journal of Ecology, also found that this trend is increasing. In fact, tree mortality in subalpine Colorado forests not affected by fire or bark beetle outbreaks in the last decade has more than tripled since the 1980s. 
> 
> “We have bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires that cause very obvious mortality of trees in Colorado. But we’re showing that even in the areas that people go hiking in and where the forest looks healthy, mortality is increasing due to heat and dry conditions alone,” said Robert Andrus, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at Washington State University. “It’s an early warning sign of climate change.”
> 
> These deaths are not only affecting larger trees, thus reducing forests’ carbon storage, but hotter and drier conditions are making it difficult for new trees to take root across the southern Rockies in Colorado, southern Wyoming and northern parts of New Mexico.
> 
> It’s well known that rising temperatures and increasing drought are causing tree deaths in forests around the globe. But here in Colorado, researchers found that heat and drought alone are responsible for over 70% of tree deaths in the 13 areas of subalpine forest they measured over the past 37 years. That’s compared with about 23% of tree deaths due to bark beetles and about 5% due to wind damage.

## Study: Lonely, older adults are nearly twice as likely to use opioids to ease pain and two-and-a-half times more likely to use sedatives and anti-anxiety medications, putting themselves at risk for drug dependency, impaired attention, falls and other accidents, and further cognitive impairment.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/421126/over-65-and-lonely-dont-talk-your-doctor-about-another-prescription):

> The study found that just over half of 6,000 respondents in a nationally representative survey of seniors living independently were not lonely, while 40 percent were moderately lonely, and 7 percent were highly lonely. The researchers found that 6 percent of the non-lonely group used prescription opioids, versus 8 percent for the moderately lonely group and 11 percent for the highly lonely group. For anti-anxiety medications and sedatives - which includes anti-cholinergic drugs, like Valium, Unisom and tricyclic antidepressants, which have been associated with a higher risk for dementia - 9 percent of the non-lonely group used them, versus 13 percent for the moderately lonely group and 23 percent for the highly lonely group.

> So when I’m old I will finally get proper sedatives and anti anxiety meds? At least I’ve got that going for me

## 3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution):

> Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth's early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life. The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. If the strands are ancient archaea, they'd become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago.

## Early humans domesticated cannabis about 12,000 years ago in what is now China — not in Central Asia, as had been widely thought. Legal restrictions have hindered studies of the plant’s history, and the authors hope that these findings will inspire future research.

## Dogs will ignore you if they know you are lying, unlike young children

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2284611-dogs-will-ignore-you-if-they-know-you-are-lying-unlike-young-children/):

> Dogs tend to ignore suggestions from people who are lying, hinting that - unlike human infants and some non-human primates - they might recognise when a person is being deceptive. "We thought dogs would behave like children under age 5 and apes, but now we speculate that perhaps dogs can understand when someone is being deceitful," says Ludwig Huber at the University of Vienna in Austria. The dogs learned to follow the suggestion of a person they had never met - the "Communicator" - who would touch the food-filled bowl, glance at the dog, and say, "Look, this is very good!" Dogs appeared to trust this new person when they were reliably following the signal, says Huber.
