## Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which clumps of tau protein are created in the brain, killing brain cells and causing Alzheimer's disease. Getting to grips with mechanisms like this may lead to breakthrough treatments.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tmu-coa102120.php):

> Tokyo, Japan - Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered a new mechanism by which clumps of tau protein are created in the brain, killing brain cells and causing Alzheimer's disease. A specific mutation to an enzyme called MARK4 changed the properties of tau, usually an important part of the skeletal structure of cells, making it more likely to aggregate, and more insoluble. Alzheimer's is said to be caused by the build-up of tangled clumps of a protein called "Tau" in brain cells.

> It messed up many proteins, not just tau so it's hard to see direct applications to human alzheimer's.

## Achieving universal mask use (95% mask use in public) could save an additional 129,574 lives in the US from September 22, 2020 through the end of February 2021, or an additional 95,814 lives assuming a lesser adoption of mask wearing (85%).

> Important detail: Their estimate for how many Americans will die from Covid-19 by February 2021 is 511,373, of which \~230K have already died. So 95% mask use is modelled to provide a \~54% reduction in future Covid-19 related deaths.

## Maya people at the ancient city of Tikal in Guatemala used a mineral called zeolite to decontaminate drinking water in one of their large reservoirs. It's the oldest known example of water purification in the Western Hemisphere.

> To be clear, zeolite is not a mineral but instead a term used to describe hydrous aluminosilicates which form a particular crystal structure. There are around 40 naturally occurring minerals which are considered zeolites.

## The arthritis drug tocilizumab doesnâ€™t appear to help fight COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-arthritis-drug-tocilizumab-not-promising):

> Of the four clinical trials that have just reported peer-reviewed results on tocilizumab for COVID-19, only one meets the "Gold standard" for evaluating a drug. Tocilizumab may have reduced the likelihood of patients needing ventilation or dying as of two weeks compared with those who didn't receive the drug. The participants who received the drug had different characteristics from those who didn't, which makes it difficult to determine whether the results are due to the drug or other factors.

> Thanks for the PSA but I think it would be a lot more efficient to let us know which drugs DO help.

## It is possible to predict future onset of Alzheimer's disease using language samples obtained from cognitively normal individuals. Significant predictive power was obtained, with AUC of 0.74 and accuracy of 0.70. The mean time to diagnosis of mild AD was 7.59 years.

> Background
> 
> The aim of this study is to use classification methods to predict future onset of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal subjects through automated linguistic analysis.
> 
> Methods
> 
> To study linguistic performance as an early biomarker of AD, we performed predictive modeling of future diagnosis of AD from a cognitively normal baseline of Framingham Heart Study participants. The linguistic variables were derived from written responses to the cookie-theft picture-description task. We compared the predictive performance of linguistic variables with clinical and neuropsychological variables. The study included 703 samples from 270 participants out of which a dataset consisting of a single sample from 80 participants was held out for testing. Half of the participants in the test set developed AD symptoms before 85 years old, while the other half did not. All samples in the test set were collected during the cognitively normal period (before MCI). The mean time to diagnosis of mild AD was 7.59 years.
> 
> Findings
> 
> Significant predictive power was obtained, with AUC of 0.74 and accuracy of 0.70 when using linguistic variables. The linguistic variables most relevant for predicting onset of AD have been identified in the literature as associated with cognitive decline in dementia.
> 
> Interpretation
> 
> The results suggest that language performance in naturalistic probes expose subtle early sings of progression to AD in advance of clinical diagnosis of impairment.
> 
> Discussion
> 
> Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict future onset of Alzheimer's disease using language samples obtained from cognitively normal individuals.

## Evidence of dairy production in the Indus Valley Civilization

Summary of [original article](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/evidence-of-dairy-production-in-the-indus-valley-civilisation/article32937155.ece):

> The year 2020 marks 100 years of discovery of Indus Valley Civilisation, and a new study has shown that dairy products were being produced by the Harappans as far back as 2500 BCE. By analysing residues on ancient pots, researchers show the earliest direct evidence of dairy product processing, thus throwing fresh light on the rural economy of the civilisation. The team was also able to show which type of animals were being used for dairy production. "The Harappans did not just use dairy for their household. The large herd indicates that milk was produced in surplus so that it could be exchanged and there could have been some kind of trade between settlements. This could have given rise to an industrial level of dairy exploitation," adds Dr. Chakraborty.

## A new OLED display can achieve more than 10,000 pixels per inch, which might lead to advanced virtual reality and augmented reality displays, researchers say. In the future, metasurfaces might also find use trapping light in applications such as solar cells and light sensors.

Summary of [original article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/metasurface-oled-display):

> Researchers Pack 10,000 Metasurface Pixels Per Inch in New OLED Display The novel display from Samsung and Stanford could find use in VR, AR. A new OLED display from Samsung and Stanford can achieve more than 10,000 pixels per inch, which might lead to advanced virtual reality and augmented reality displays, researchers say. A commercial large-scale OLED television might have a pixel density of about 100 to 200 pixels per inch, whereas a mobile phone's OLED display might achieve 400 to 500 PPI. Two different kinds of OLED displays have reached commercial success in mobile devices and large-scale TVs. Mobile devices mostly used red, green and blue OLEDs, which companies manufacture by depositing dots of organic film through metal sheets with many tiny holes punched in them. The way in which light can build up within the display gives it twice the luminescence efficiency of standard color-filtered white OLED displays, as well as higher color purity, the researchers say.

> At CES this year I remember seeing a display that had an absurd number of pixels per inch, and those pixels were directional.

> It would then use face tracking to aim specific messages at specific people as they walked around. The demo was using a travel theme, and as you scanned your 'boarding pass' you would then see messages specific to your departure on monitors as you walked around, and unless someone was standing like literally right behind your head they'd never see your message (and the messages didn't have anything secret anyways, it was just an easy way of showing 100 different people 100 different things on a small readerboard).
