## In the US, admission into selective high schools is as difficult to achieve as admission into top universities. However, a new study found that elite schools don’t help students academically any more than their less prestigious ones, including students from more disadvantaged neighborhoods.

## People with beliefs in conspiracy theories have a cognitive bias known as the jumping to conclusion (JTC) bias, the tendency to perform hasty decisions based on little evidence, and a preference for an intuitive general thinking style, as opposed to analytical thinking.

## Teens unhappy with their physical appearance are at significant risk of depression by early adulthood. Heightened risk ranges from 50% to 285% by age of 18, with depression severity greater in boys. Dislike of one’s physical appearance affects up to 61% of teens worldwide.

## Faecal microbiota transplantation(FMT) from healthy donors is highly effective, and superior to antibiotics, for diarrhoea caused by recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. High quality of evidence suggests.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30386-2/fulltext):

> Abbreviations: CDI, CDAD, CI, FMT, GI, NA, NOS, Number needed to treat, PRISMA, Randomised clinical trial, RR, RoB2Faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Now, further to these earlier systematic reviews, more evidence has accumulated, and new methods of delivery have emerged; as such, an update of the evidence with the latest data is pivotal to guide clinical decisions and improve the future recommendations for FMT in managing patients with recurrent CDI. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to establish the evidence for using FMT in recurrent CDI, to provide updated effect estimates specific to different delivery methods and treatment regimens, and to compare the effect of FMT with that of standard antibiotics. In a series of separate subgroup analyses, neither high risk of bias, follow-up times above 8 weeks, nor faecal doses above 50 g significantly changed the estimated effect rates for repeat or single FMT. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates a high quality of evidence for the repeated use of FMT in recurrent CDI and supports that FMT is superior to vancomycin with a number needed to treat of 1.5 for repeated administrations.

## A healthy gut microbiome contributes to normal brain function. Scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors in mice, by causing a reduction in endogenous cannabinoids.

> These findings, which show that a healthy gut microbiota contributes to normal brain function, were published in Nature Communications on December 11, 2020. Using animal models, scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors, in particular by causing a reduction in lipid metabolites in the blood and the brain. "This discovery shows the role played by the gut microbiota in normal brain function," continues Gérard Eberl, Head of the Microenvironment and Immunity Unit and joint last author of the study.

## Rampant partisanship in the US may be the largest obstacle to reduced social mobility critical to limiting spread of COVID-19. Partisanship is more important than public health concerns for explaining willingness to reduce mobility. This effect has grown over time, especially among Republicans.

> And we can blame Facebook and other forms of social media for this partisanship. I’d like to see a study tracking the rise of modern political partisanship with the increased use of social media. Bet you’d see a lot of statistical consistency between the two.
