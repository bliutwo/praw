## Lead from leaded petrol persists in London air despite ‘90s ban: Research shows that 40% of the lead found in London's airborne particles comes from the legacy of leaded gas — a pollutant banned back in 1999.

Summary of [original article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/224474/lead-from-leaded-petrol-persists-london/):

> Research from Imperial College London has found that lead from leaded petrol persists in London's air despite its ban in 1999. Despite this drop, airborne particles in London are still highly lead-enriched compared to natural background levels, according to new Imperial research published in PNAS. Despite the leaded petrol ban, historically combusted lead is still present in London's air more than 20 years later. Lead author of the study Dr Eléonore Resongles, who carried out the work at Imperial's Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said: "Petrol-derived lead from decades ago remains an important pollutant in London. Despite the leaded petrol ban, historically combusted lead is still present in London's air more than 20 years later."

## Children who learned techniques such as deep breathing and yoga slept longer and better, even though the curriculum didn’t instruct them in improving sleep, a Stanford study has found.

> I believe there have been a series of good studies on mindfulness for children.  Educators are adapting these introspective and contemplative practices for children. I know Richard Davidson was one of the strong advocates for it.

## Women who use electronic cigarettes during pregnancy are 33% more likely than those who don’t to give birth to low-birthweight infants, according to a new study by a team of researchers from UCLA and other institutions.

> Nicotine causes reduction in uteroplacental circulation, leading to lower maternal weight gain and in turn, negative fetal outcomes, such as small size for gestational age, low birth weight, short stature, and compromised fetal neurological development.

> If you're pregnant, cut all nicotine use out.

## The average body size of humans has fluctuated significantly over the last million years and is strongly linked to temperature. Colder, harsher climates drove the evolution of larger body sizes, while warmer climates led to smaller bodies.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24290-7):

> In this study, we show that different environmental variables predict body and brain size in the genus Homo over the past 1 Ma. These results suggest that brain size within Homo is less influenced by environmental variables than body size during the past 1.0 Ma. Using emulated global climate model data27, this study shows that different climatic variables predict human brain and body size evolution over the past 1 Ma.

> Makes sense from a basic surface area versus volume perspective.  The bigger you are, the more heat you generate internally versus the heat you can get rid of via evaporative cooling.  The weird thing for me is it seems like the availability of food would go the other way.

## Dancing with music can halt most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Participants displayed less motor impairment and showed significant improvement in areas related to speech, tremors, balance and rigidity compared to those who did not do any dance exercise.

Summary of [original article](https://news.yorku.ca/2021/07/07/dancing-with-music-can-halt-most-debilitating-symptoms-of-parkinsons-disease/):

> TORONTO, July 7, 2021 - A new study published in Brain Sciences today, shows patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease can slow the progress of the disease by participating in dance training with music for one-and-a-quarter hours per week. The study showed overall that non-motor aspects of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, motor examination symptoms and motor complications did not show any impairment across time among the dance-trained PwPD group compared to PwPD who do not dance. "Generally, what we know is that dance activates brain areas in those without PD. For those with Parkinson's disease even when it's mild motor impairment can impact their daily functioning - how they feel about themselves. Many of these motor symptoms lead to isolation because once they get extreme, these people don't want to go out. These motor symptoms lead to further psychological issues, depression, social isolation and eventually the symptoms do get worse over time. Our study shows that training with dance and music can slow this down and improve their daily living and daily function."

> Dancing (at least for someone as clumsy as me) is hard work for the brain. After 2h of learning one simple new dance step I am literally *exhausted* „in my head“. I can only guess that the constant rewiring of dancing partially counters the „dewiring“ of Parkinson’s

## Lubricant found in a beetle's leg is more slippery than Teflon

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2283348-lubricant-found-in-a-beetles-leg-is-more-slippery-than-teflon/):

> A lubricant harvested from beetle legs reduces friction more than Teflon. Many beetles are known to have a natural lubricant in their joints that prevents wear and tear. The team found that pores in the shell of the beetle around the leg joint exude the waxy lubricant in cylinders up to 1 micrometre wide.

`/u/MainRemote` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ofiuny/lubricant_found_in_a_beetles_leg_is_more_slippery/):

> This is exciting, if it can be mass produced. As it is protein based, it is not going to involve the side production of forever-chemicals like Teflon does.

## COVID-19 can have long-term effects on heart rate, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/07/07/coronavirus-heart-rate-study/6091625664332/):

> "Continuously tracking physiological changes such as resting heart rate using a fitness tracker may help us to identify individuals who are experiencing ongoing inflammation or autonomic immune dysfunction as a result of their COVID-19 infection," study co-author Jennifer Radin told UPI. "Sensor data helps to objectively measure the physiological impact of COVID-19," said Radin, an epidemiologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif. The findings are based on an analysis of health data collected from 875 adults who reported symptoms of a respiratory illness in the United States using wearable fitness tracking devices or mobile apps. The findings highlight the effects of the virus on the heart and that many of those infected experience lingering symptoms, or "Long" COVID-19, the researchers said. "COVID-19 can cause an individual's resting heart rate to remain elevated for two to three months on average," Radin said.

> Anecdotal, had covid now have a heart murmur on my latest ekg (100 days post infection). Have a stress test next Tuesday to learn more.  Also developed a partially numb finger joint which took me to the doctor in the first place.  Take car of yourself, make time to listen to your body.
