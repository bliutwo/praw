## COVID-19 warnings were on Twitter well before the outbreak of the pandemic. Researchers have identified tracks of increasing concern about pneumonia cases on posts published on Twitter in seven countries, between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020

> A new study of researchers at IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, published in Scientific Reports, has identified tracks of increasing concern about pneumonia cases on posts published on Twitter in seven countries, between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. To conduct the research, the authors first created a unique database with all the messages posted on Twitter containing the keyword "Pneumonia" in the seven most spoken languages of the European Union - English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and Dutch - from December 2014 until 1 March 2020. The researchers then made a number of adjustments and corrections to the posts in the database to avoid overestimating the number of tweets mentioning pneumonia between December 2019 and January 2020, that is to say in the weeks between the World Health Organization announcement that the first "Cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology" had been identified - on 31 December 2019 - and the official recognition of COVID19 as a serious transmissible disease, on 21 January 2020.

## A Complex Systems Theorist Explains Why the Poor Aren't to Blame for Poverty - Mathematically speaking, blaming individuals with limited resources caught in vast social systems for their misfortune doesn't make sense.

> It's not as helpful as politicians doing their jobs, but if you want to do something that can really help these animals and all the others that live near you, plant native plants on any piece of land you can influence. Fill your yard. Tell your neighbors. Plant them at church or school or work. We need native plants everywhere. Ecosystems are built on plants. Planting native plants feeds insect that can only feed on native plants, which is most of them. Many of our native bees are need the pollen of specific native flowers to feed their young and complete their life cycle. There are 500 or so species of caterpillar that can eat oaks in north america. There are 4 species that can eat asian crepe myrtle. These insects feed other species. Like birds which take something like 900 insects/day to raise a nest of babies. Or these foxes which get 1/4 of their calories from insects. Invest in your ecosystem! Invest in diversity! Obviously we need systemic change, but part of the change that will save our future is building Home Grown National Park!!!

## Chinese retaliatory tariffs (in response to Trump's tariffs) systematically targeted Republican-supporting counties (particularly, swing districts). Voters in these areas were more likely to learn about the tariffs, their adverse impact and assign responsibility to the Republican Party.

## Global ice loss rate is accelerating, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2021/01/25/Global-ice-loss-rate-is-accelerating-study-finds/5111611553528/):

> Jan. 25 - A new survey of ice loss around the globe suggests the rate at which the planet's ice sheets and glaciers are melting is rapidly accelerating. "Over the past three decades there's been a huge international effort to understand what's happening to individual components in Earth's ice system, revolutionized by satellites which allow us to routinely monitor the vast and inhospitable regions where ice can be found," lead study author Thomas Slater said in a news release. The data showed all kinds of ice, including glaciers and ice sheets, have suffered significant losses since 1994, but Arctic sea ice and Antarctic ice shelves accounted for the most dramatic declines.

## Mean children grow into mean adults: a new study followed 704 children for 12 years, and found that the 9% who reported frequently being mean at age 10 were up to 14x more likely to report frequently being mean at age 22. The other 91% generally became less mean over time.
