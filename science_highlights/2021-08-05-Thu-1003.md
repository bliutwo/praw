## Researchers warn trends in sex selection favouring male babies will result in a preponderance of men in over 1/3 of world’s population, and a surplus of men in countries will cause a “marriage squeeze,” and may increase antisocial behavior & violence.

Summary of [original article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/preference-for-sons-could-lead-to-4-7-m-missing-female-births):

> A new modeling study by the same group of scientists now predicts that in 12 countries known to have skewed sex ratios at birth, there will be an additional 4.7 million missing female births by 2030. Dr. John Bongaarts, vice president and distinguished scholar at the Population Council, in New York, who co-authored this study, said that the future number of missing females due to excess mortality is likely to be much higher than the number of missing female births. He added, the new analysis in BMJ Global Health predicts a higher number of missing births than his own study had. "This is largely due to different assumptions about how rapidly sex ratios at births decline to normal in the future," Dr. Bongaarts told MNT. The new study is more pessimistic about how quickly sex ratios will decline in countries where they are currently elevated.

## People with a conspiracy mindset are no less likely to accept vaccines. When people with a conspiracy mindset perceived their social circle as being supportive of vaccines (including a COVID-19 vaccine), their intention to get vaccinated was just as high as those without a conspiracy mindset.

## The ancient Babylonians understood key concepts in geometry, including how to make precise right-angled triangles. They used this mathematical know-how to divide up farmland – more than 1000 years before the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, with whom these ideas are associated.

> The ancient Babylonians understood key concepts in geometry, including how to make precise right-angled triangles. Mansfield has been studying a broken clay tablet from this period, known as Plimpton 322. "Even the shapes of these tablets tell a story," says Mansfield.

> Pythagoras was not the first to use this idea. He was the first to have to have a  proof that this idea works for all right angled triangles (that we know of).

## A new mathematical model for predicting infectious disease outbreaks incorporates fear—both of disease and of vaccines—to better understand how pandemics can occur in multiple waves of infections, like those we are seeing with COVID-19.

## Scientists were surprised when mice they were treating for diabetes dropped half their weight and developed extra-shiny coats. The cytokine they had administered led to fast fat-loss via an oily substance we secrete through skin - and could point toward future treatments for obesity and skin issues.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/slimy-mice-fat-loss-discovery):

> The mice were shiny because they were secreting fat out through their skin, making their fur so greasy it looked wet. The discovery - Once they ruled out these other explanations for the mice's fast fat loss, Kambayashi says he went back to a detail he had noticed and dismissed - he always knew how to tell the TSLP mice apart from the controls because of one strange physical factor. The researchers had discovered something important: not only were mice actually ejecting fat out of their bodies through their skin, but there was a link between this cytokine and the sebaceous glands, which create a protective barrier for the skin.

`/u/DeftNerd` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oxw9y7/scientists_were_surprised_when_mice_they_were/):

> After reading the actual journal article, this is fascinating. While the side effects of being incredibly "greasy" (and all that entails, like increased acne or seborrheic dermatitis), the potential benefits are amazing. 
> 
> It's also very interesting that the overweight mice lost about half their weight in a month. The speed of how quickly fat is capable of being processed into sebum is astonishing. 
> 
> The treatment may not have the same effect in humans. Science is littered with amazing studies with mice that don't pan out in humans. 
> 
> If it is effective in humans, suffering with "disgusting" levels of oily skin for a few weeks or a month would be something people desperate to help their weight, cholesterol, and diabetic problems would likely be happy to put up with.

## People who base their self-worth on their financial success tend to have less satisfying romantic relationships

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/08/people-who-base-their-self-worth-on-their-financial-success-tend-to-have-less-satisfying-romantic-relationships-61635):

> "It's not the case that liking, valuing, or wanting to have money and/or financial success is a bad thing. It's when a person views financial success as a core component of what makes them a good or worthwhile person that can open them up to vulnerabilities," Ward explained to PsyPost. "People often ask, 'how can we change what we base our self-worth on?' The process of how we come to base our self-worth in certain domains is not well-understood but we do have data suggesting people are more likely to base their self-worth on financial success when they believe there are benefits to having financial success," Ward said. "This is a correlational study, so we cannot definitively say that having financially contingent self-worth causes people to have more financial conflicts with their relationship partners. For example, it could instead be that having more financial conflicts leads people to believe that having more money would improve their relationship problems, which could increase their tendency to base self-worth on money."
