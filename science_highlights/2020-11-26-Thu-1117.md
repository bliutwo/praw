## Americans on the left and right are engaged in a culture war, and even intimate family gatherings are subject to tensions. Politically diverse Thanksgiving dinners were 24 minutes shorter than politically uniform ones, finds new study replicating a previous one that found them 35–70 minutes shorter.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239988):

> Our primary goal was to test whether politically diverse Thanksgiving dinners were shorter than politically uniform ones in the years 2018 and 2019. Using a complementary method to that used in previous research, we found little evidence to support the notion that politically diverse dinners were shorter than politically uniform ones, and we found positive support for the conclusion that diverse dinners tend to be of similar duration as politically uniform ones. These analyses also found that dinners at home and dinners at other people's homes were several hours longer than dinners at restaurants; the earlier the start time, the longer the dinner; dinners with more people were longer than dinners with fewer people; males reported longer dinners than females; and white people reported shorter dinners than non-white people.

## Even Earth’s largest-ever sharks needed nurseries for their babies. Ancient teeth hint that a handful of sites served as sheltered sanctuaries for immature megalodon sharks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03304-2):

> The prehistoric shark Otodus megalodon was an awe-inspiring beast, measuring up to three times the length of the modern great white shark. Nurseries are protected areas with shallow waters and abundant prey where young sharks can develop in relative safety. Big, slow-growing species of shark persist only when the survival rate of juveniles is high, and nurseries can make this possible.

> Christ, these things were terrifying. Average length 32'. That's *three stories*.
> "Unlike the great white, which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey."
> Crime boss of the seas.
> Shiver me timbers.

## AstraZeneca’s best COVID vaccine result was a fluke. Experts have questions

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/astrazenecas-best-covid-vaccine-result-was-a-fluke-experts-have-questions/):

> Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford made an exciting announcement Monday: the COVID-19 vaccine they developed together appeared up to 90 percent effective at preventing disease. In one regimen, trial participants received two "Full" vaccine doses, 28 days apart. Operation Warp Speed has invested in AZD1222 and is supporting an ongoing trial of the vaccine in the US. Slaoui noted in the press conference that they knew about the dosing error at the time it happened.

> Two problems with the same trial... Not the same age group and not the same dose.  This have to be researched/explained properly or entirely redoing the trial.

## Phosphorus and fluorine have been discovered in solid dust particles collected from a comet. This is the first time life-necessary CHNOPS elements are found in solid cometary matter and indicates that all the most important elements necessary for life may have been delivered to Earth by comets.

## A growth mindset of interest, viewing interests as developable, and not fixed, can help people make connections among diverse fields that others might miss, such as bridging traditional boundaries between science and art, which can spark innovative thinking.

Summary of [original article](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/a-growth-mindset-of-interest-can-spark-innovative-thinking/):

> Those with a growth mindset of interest tend to believe that interests can be developed and cultivated, while those with a fixed mindset of interest tend to believe that interests are inherent and simply need to be 'found. Given the potential of a growth mindset of interest for innovation, this begs the question: Can a growth mindset of interest be cultivated? "Under the right circumstances, absolutely," said Asst Prof O'Keefe. "People can be influenced to adopt a growth mindset of interest if they are immersed in an environment with a culture that promotes and reinforces the idea that interests can grow and develop. Moreover, there must be opportunities for people to act on their belief that new interests can develop. Therefore, universities and organisations, among others, may wish to provide opportunities to explore new topics and activities, be it through workshops, elective courses, or facilitating collaborations among people with different areas of interest and expertise."

> I feel if you have a growth mindset, you want to explore where others are afraid to branch out. Naturally, you're going to have more diverse interests, so it comes as no surprise that you'd find connections between them.

## People who are psychologically flexible have better romantic and family relationships. It is about being open to experiences, experiencing thoughts and feelings without obsessively clinging to them, and continuing to take steps toward a goal, even in the face of setbacks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/psychological-flexibility-romantic-familial-relationships-462812/):

> Analysis shows those who are psychologically flexible have better romantic and family relationships. "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way," Leo Tolstoy wrote famously in 1878 in the opening lines of Anna Karenina. Seeing difficult thoughts and feelings as a personal reflection and feeling judged or shameful for having them.
