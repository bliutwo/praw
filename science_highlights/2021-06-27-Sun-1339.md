## Climate Change Is Making Extreme Weather Events More Frequent, Say Scientists

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change-is-making-extreme-weather-events-more-frequent-globally):

> Storms, floods, and droughts can be catastrophic for people and the environment, but are these events on the rise? We asked 4 experts in climate science 'Are extreme weather events becoming more frequent globally?', here is what we found. Dr Michael Wehner, an expert in climatology from the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in the US says, "Certain types of extreme weather have already become more severe because of human-induced climate change. Other types of extreme weather are expected to become more severe as the climate warms, but changes have not definitely been found so far." Extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, and extreme rainfall are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change.

## A new nanotech OLED that could free up 20% more light from organic light-emitting diodes has been developed at the University of Michigan. It could help extend the battery life of smartphones and laptops, or make next-gen televisions and displays much more energy efficient.

Summary of [original article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/26/eabg0355):

> The normal organic layer thickness used in OLEDs does not support the waveguide modes, leading to notably enhanced EQE. We successfully fabricated an ultrathin uniform Ag film of around 5 nm using copper seed layer that has Rsh = 21.3 ohms/sq and transmittance at  = 550 nm of 80.7%. We designed an experiment to prove the absence of the guided modes in an organic waveguide with the thin Cu-Ag film. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTheoretical investigation of waveguide mode eliminationLight generated at the active region excites the SPP and waveguide modes, where the SPP mode is the fundamental transverse magnetic mode and the waveguide modes consist of the fundamental transverse electric and first-order TM modes. Formation of waveguide mode is also suppressed in top-emitting OLEDs when Ag alloy is used for TCE. From a waveguide point of view, glass clad is replaced with air in top-emitting OLEDs, which increases the refractive index difference between the waveguide core and clad, thus requiring thinner organic waveguide to achieve the waveguide mode cutoff.

## The use of mescaline, a psychedelic substance derived from the peyote cactus, appears to be associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, according to a new preliminary study published in the journal ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/06/use-of-mescaline-may-facilitate-unintended-improvements-in-several-psychiatric-conditions-study-suggests-61280):

> The use of mescaline, a psychedelic substance derived from the peyote cactus, appears to be associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, according to a new preliminary study published in the journal ACS Pharmacology & Translational Science. The research on the long-term psychological effects of mescaline use is still in a very early stage and the study has some important caveats to consider. "Nevertheless, the results from our study indicate that when administered in a naturalistic setting, mescaline may facilitate unintended improvements in self-reported depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders," they added.

`/u/psychonautistic` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o93zum/the_use_of_mescaline_a_psychedelic_substance/):

> Weird, it's like all those psychedelic substances that I'm the US were classified as having No Medical Use is really just the result of religion and older generation's morals and not a reflection of their actual value or use.

## Researchers have discovered that a specific chemical feature of a key protein known as tau may cause it to accumulate in the brain and trigger illnesses like Alzheimer's.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/tmu-top062321.php):

> Tokyo, Japan - Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered that a specific chemical feature of a key protein known as tau may cause it to accumulate in the brain and trigger illnesses like Alzheimer's. In their most recent work, they found that alterations to amino acid residues in the protein known as cysteines in two different locations had a drastic effect on the amount and toxicity of tau. The team hope that knowledge of exactly which chemical groups are responsible for tau toxicity may lead to novel therapies which reduce or prevent tau accumulation, helping sufferers of tauopathies around the world.

> Most allegations of causal relationships between brain accumulation of specific chemicals and Alzheimer's have ended up being not causal in the way initially proposed. Maybe this one will be different.

## Scientists discovered a 120-million-year-old partial fossil skeleton of a tiny extinct bird that fits in the palm of the hand & preserves a unique skull with a mix of dinosaurian & bird features.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-tiny-120-million-year-old-fossil-has-a-t-rex-like-skull-on-a-bird-body):

> A tiny, 120 million-year-old fossil, discovered in northeast China, is neither bird nor dinosaur but is perched on its own evolutionary branch, somewhere in between. "Having a 'dinosaur' skull on a bird body certainly did not stop the enantiornithines, or other early birds, from being highly successful in places all around the world for tens of millions of years during the Cretaceous," says paleontologist Min Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Digital reconstruction of the Mesozoic bird fossil skeleton.

## A team of engineers and clinicians has developed an ultra-thin, inflatable device that can be used to treat the most severe forms of pain without the need for invasive surgery.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/spinal-implants):

> A team of engineers and clinicians has developed an ultra-thin, inflatable device that can be used to treat the most severe forms of pain without the need for invasive surgery. Early tests of the device suggest that it could be an effective treatment for many forms of severe pain - including leg and back pain - which are not remedied by painkillers. Although other types of spinal cord stimulation devices are currently used to treat severe pain, the most effective of these devices are bulky and require invasive surgery, while current keyhole devices are far less effective at treating pain.

`/u/matts2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/o9137s/a_team_of_engineers_and_clinicians_has_developed/):

> Misleading but still interesting. Spinal cord stimulators are great for some kinds of back pain, useless for others.
