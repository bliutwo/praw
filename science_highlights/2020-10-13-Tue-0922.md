## New Study Casts Doubt On The Climate Benefits Of Natural Gas Power Plants | The emissions and methane leaks from new gas plants zero out the CO2 cuts achieved from closing coal plants, a peer-reviewed analysis found.

Summary of [original article](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f7f74f0c5b664e5babb0ea8?guccounter=1&utm_campaign=Hot+News&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=97281227&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ANffN6pugEC0off0mqQ0lA7foY6dDXXwHW6ufrD_u1s-GJ9BaRBrK-rOGzGwH19NHK9uq5dK8wK3PTwFaBQPMIFbp1w&utm_content=97281227&utm_source=hs_email):

> If the new fleet of gas plants built over the past decade last as long and are used as often as the coal units they replaced, the projected emissions for the U.S. power sector for the lifespan of the stations will decrease by just 12%, a study published last month in the peer-reviewed journal AGU Advances found. The new study marked one of the first major attempts to measure the cumulative lifetime emissions from the U.S. power sector since the fracking boom shifted the majority of electricity production to natural gas. The U.S. would need to shut down many of its gas plants or dramatically reduce how often it uses them to truly meet the emissions cuts promised under the Paris climate accords, the study found.

> Tl;dr: If the **worst case** wild-ass guesses of a model are correct, then CO2 equivalent emissions will be the same.
> 
> Actual CO2 emissions will be much lower.

## First Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 Reinfections in US

Summary of [original article](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/939003?src=mkm_covid_update_201012_mscpedit_&uac=168522FV&impID=2616440&faf=1):

> Researchers say these are the first documented cases of COVID-19 reinfection in the U.S. About two dozen other cases of COVID-19 reinfection have been reported around the globe, from Hong Kong, Belgium, the Netherlands, India, and Ecuador. Until now, immunologists haven't been too concerned about these reinfections because most second infections have been milder than the first, indicating that the immune system is doing its job and fighting off the virus when it is recognized a second time. Were they sicker because they got a larger dose of the virus? Was there something about the gene changes to the virus that made it more damaging when the men caught it again? Or could their first COVID-19 infections have somehow primed their immune systems the wrong way, leading to more severe infections the second time - a phenomenon called enhancement?

> A 25-year-old man from Nevada and a 42-year-old man in Virginia experienced second bouts of COVID-19 about 2 months after they tested positive the first time. Gene tests show both men  had two slightly different strains of the virus, suggesting that they  caught the infection twice. 
> Researchers say these are the first documented cases of COVID-19 reinfection in the U.S. About two dozen other cases of COVID-19 reinfection have been reported around the globe, from Hong Kong, Belgium, the Netherlands, India, and Ecuador.  A third U.S. case, in a 60-year-old in Washington, has been reported but hasn't yet been peer reviewed.

> The second reinfection has more severe symptoms during than the initial infection, potentially complicating the development and deployment of effective vaccines.

## After the first peak, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a due to weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent US response to the pandemic.

> As this is a scientific investigation, it doesn't state an absolute conclusion - but I suspect many reading this will have an interesting response to the words 'may have been due' in the summary.

## Smartphone apps that tell commuters when a bus will arrive at a stop don’t result in less time waiting than just using the official bus route schedule, a new study done in Columbus, Ohio suggests.

> Whether I am using an app or the standard schedule, I always overestimate how long it will take to walk to the bus stop and I end up waiting anyway.  Better early than late though, I suppose.

## The raging lung inflammation that can contribute to death from the flu can be stopped in its tracks by a drug derived from MG53, a naturally occurring human protein, a new study in mice suggests. The treatment protects lungs without killing the flu virus.

## 2016 US presidential election associated with uptick in heart attacks and stroke. The hospitalization rate for acute cardiovascular disease events in a large southern California health system was 1.62 times higher in the two days immediately after the 2016 presidential election.

Summary of [original article](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/06/2012096117):

> AbstractPrevious research suggests that stressors may trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular disease events within hours to days, but there has been limited research around sociopolitical events such as presidential elections. The rate of CVD events in the 2 d after the 2016 presidential election compared to the rate in the window prior to the 2016 election was 1.62 times higher. Transiently heightened cardiovascular risk around the 2016 election may be attributable to sociopolitical stress.

> I’m going to guess because same-sex couples have to go to a fair amount of effort for children? They are going to be very wanted children - no accidents, no ‘oh, it’s the next thing to do, it’s expected of us’.
