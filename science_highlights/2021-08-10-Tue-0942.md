## Fecal transplants from young mice reverses age-related declines in immune function, cognition, and memory in old mice, implicating the microbiome in various diseases and aging

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/new-poo-new-you-fecal-transplants-reverse-signs-brain-aging-mice):

> New research shows a transplant of gut microbes, in the form of feces, from young mice to old ones can turn back the clock on the aging brain. To test whether a young microbiome could reverse signs of aging, researchers took fecal samples from 3- to 4-month-old mice, the equivalent of young adults, and transplanted them into 20-month-old animals-ancient by mouse standards. As controls, old mice received transplants from fellow old mice, and young from young.

> We should consider renaming fecal transplant to Microbiome transplant.  And not use "slurry"

## Climate change ‘double whammy’ could kill off fish species. A new study of 150 million years of fish evolution provides first evidence to support scientific theory that commonly-eaten fish species will become smaller as waters warm under climate change.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR858656.aspx):

> 'Serious implications' Professor Chris Venditti, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading, and co-author of the study, said: "Warming waters are a double whammy for fish, as they not only cause them to evolve to a smaller size, but also reduce their ability to move to more suitable environments."Our research supports the theory that fish will get smaller as oceans warm under climate change, but reveals the worrying news that they will also not be able to evolve to cope as efficiently as first thought. This will impact fish species because larger fish are able to travel longer distances owing to their greater energy reserves, whereas smaller fish are less able to seek out new environments with favourable conditions as the climate changes. Instead, the scientists found warmer waters would lead to fewer new species developing, robbing fish of another of their key weapons to cope with climate change.

## Giraffes May Be as Socially Complex as Chimps and Elephants. A review of earlier research shows giraffes have the markings of social creatures, including friendships, day care and grandmothers.

## Praise can help to improve a child's academic performance, study finds. "What we found was that in year five, the kids whose parents overestimated their ability, they were optimistic and they did better in subsequent NAPLAN tests,"

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-08/praise-helps-a-childs-academic-performance-says-study/100327124):

> Importantly, it's not just about giving your child any kind of praise - you've got to give particular sorts of praise, Professor Parker adds. "That's the sort of praise that can really promote in children a real love of learning that isn't contingent on your praise but is furthered by your praise." Remembering to praise is important when you give a child constructive criticism, McCormack says.

`/u/D_Welch` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/p199go/praise_can_help_to_improve_a_childs_academic/):

> This shouldn't come as a surprise. Confidence is built layer at a time, and when your efforts are rewarded, not just by immediate results, but by the people you look up to verifying you have done well, the hills of life become much less intimidating and those challenges become just another situation to conquer. 
> 
> The exact opposite of what happens when at every turn you are questioned and run down for not trying hard enough, or eating too much, or not doing it the way some other child is doing it. This is the same for most all people at any stage of their lives, but as the (para) phrase goes, give me the child and I will give you the man.

## Planting forests may cool the planet more than thought. Study found that greater formation of clouds over forested areas suggests that reforestation would likely be more effective at cooling Earth’s atmosphere than previously thought

> Cool. So instead of a carbon tax, let's just require an amount of land area to be purchased, maintained, protected, and planted specifically by corporations in proportion to their carbon output.

## By reexamining evidence collected by the Curiosity rover, scientists hypothesize most of the sedimentary deposits in Gale Crater were in fact not lake sediments. Instead, they may have been windblown sediments that formed in open air. This changes scientists' perception of Mars' past habitability.

Summary of [original article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/32/eabh2687):

> Color patterns imaged by High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment within the Gale crater weathering sequences are also similar to the weathering sequences in the Mawrth Vallis region. A fortunate outcome of the Curiosity mission is revelation of the details of a weathering pattern in situ that is observed by spectroscopic remote sensing both in Gale crater and throughout the ancient surface of Mars. The layered sulfates above the weathering sequences may form as a result of ice weathering after the average temperature of Mars surface dropped below freezing point of water or the boundary between sulfate-dominated and clay-dominated weathering assemblages might represent a boundary between ice-dominated and meltwater-dominated weathering contexts.

## COVID-19 May Alter the Brain's Fight or Flight Response

Summary of [original article](https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/covid-19-may-alter-the-brains-fight-or-flight-response-351868):

> New research published in The Journal of Physiology found that otherwise healthy young people diagnosed with COVID-19, regardless of their symptom severity, have problems with their nervous system when compared with healthy control subjects. The COVID-19 subjects rated their pain substantially lower than healthy subjects typically do. The biggest limitation in the present study is its cross-sectional nature - in other words, we do not know what the COVID-19 subjects' nervous system activity "Looked like" before they were diagnosed with COVID-19.
