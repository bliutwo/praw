## Staying true to yourself in a relationship leads to the best outcomes, except among people who are high in psychopathy. Psychopathic tendencies appear to disrupt the link between authenticity and relationship well-being.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/08/psychopathic-tendencies-appear-to-disrupt-the-link-between-authenticity-and-relationship-well-being-61696):

> The findings indicate that "the relationship between authenticity and well-being may depend upon the personality traits being expressed," Seto said. The link between psychopathy and poor relationships is not surprising given that the personality trait is characterized by low levels of empathy and remorse - two qualities that are important for maintaining positive relationships. "In our studies, only psychopathy consistently influenced the relationship between authentic self-expression and our interpersonal relationship measures.

> I dated a woman who I quickly determined was seriously mentally ill, and her desire to be whoever I wanted her to be was overwhelming.  She couldn’t tolerate me disagreeing with her on anything, quickly changing her own opinion to match mine on even the smallest thing.  If I revealed a personal interest, she would act like she’s always loved that thing while clearly having no real experience with it.  It was a distance relationship that didn’t last long, and it was this trait of incessantly changing everything about herself to try to please me that was the reason.  It wasn’t just unattractive to me, it was downright concerning.
> 
> Two months later, I learned that she tried to transfer her job to move near me.  Two and a half years of zero contact with her later, I received a cryptic Christmas card from her.  I was renting a home for just three months at that point with maybe my license and insurance updated.  This was in the late ‘90s, and I had zero online presence whatsoever.  The most plausible explanation was that she hired a PI to track me down.  That wigged me out for a bit, but nothing else happened in the decades since, thankfully.

## Major print media in five countries have been representing climate change very factually, hitting a 90 percent accuracy rate in the last 15 years. Scientifically accurate coverage of man-made climate change is becoming less biased, However research did find biased coverage in conservative media.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/925492):

> Scientifically accurate coverage of man-made climate change is becoming less biased-headlining the idea that print media are no longer presenting climate change as controversy. Canada's National Post, Australia's Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, and the U.K.'s Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, all historically conservative outlets, had significantly less accurate coverage of climate change. "The terrain of climate debates has largely shifted in recent years away from mere denial of human contributions to climate change to a more subtle and ongoing undermining of support for specific policies meant to substantially address climate change."

## Small blobs of human brain grown in a dish have been coaxed into forming rudimentary eyes, which respond to light by sending signals to the rest of the brain tissue.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287207-tiny-human-brain-grown-in-lab-has-eye-like-structures-that-see-light/):

> Small blobs of human brain grown in a dish have been coaxed into forming rudimentary eyes, which respond to light by sending signals to the rest of the brain tissue. The pairs of eye-like structures create tissues similar to those in real eyes, including a round lens, which normally focuses an image, and a retina, the patch of tissue at the back of the eye that senses light. In a way, the brain tissue is "Seeing" light, says Jay Gopalakrishnan at Heinrich Heine.

## Mountains have small but noticeable effects on personality, study finds (n = 32,666). People who live at high altitudes tend to have an open personality to effectively deal with threats and endorse conservative values that promote a social order that minimizes threats.

## Mini brains grown in a lab from stem cells have spontaneously developed rudimentary eye structures, scientists report in a fascinating new paper. This incredible result will help us to better understand the process of eye differentiation and development, as well as eye diseases.

## Short, daytime naps don't relieve sleep deprivation, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/short-daytime-naps-don-t-relieve-sleep-deprivation-study-finds-1.5546043):

> The study, conducted by researchers out of Michigan State University's Sleep and Learning Lab, found that short naps ranging between 30 and 60 minutes are ineffective in mitigating the potentially dangerous cognitive effects of sleep deprivation. "The group that stayed overnight and took short naps still suffered from the effects of sleep deprivation and made significantly more errors on the tasks than their counterparts who went home and obtained a full night of sleep," said study author and director of MSU's sleep lab Kimberly Fenn in a press release. While the naps showed no "Measurable effects" in mitigating the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation, researchers reported that the amount of slow-wave sleep - the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep - obtained during the nap was linked to a reduction of impairments associated with sleep deprivation.

> An I reading the story right, and it's comparing a full night sleep to people that pulled an all nighter with just a short nap? Because the headline made it seem more like an afternoon nap or something (like to catch up after getting too little sleep the night before).
> 
> Note: I might be sleep deprived.
