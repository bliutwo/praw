## Scientists have gained new insight into the genetic underpinnings of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder through a first-of-its-kind study based on blood samples taken in emergency rooms from patients who had just experienced traumatic events.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/data-collected-in-emergency-rooms-takes-us-closer-to-roots-of-depression-ptsd/):

> The study, published May 7 in Molecular Psychiatry, identifies a series of possible causal genes for PTSD, bringing us nearer to the long-sought "Smoking gun" explaining why some people develop the disorder following a traumatic event, while most others recover after a period of relatively brief psychiatric distress, said Charles B. Nemeroff, a professor of psychiatry, the director of the Institute for Early Life Adversity Research at the University of Texas and the study's corresponding author, in an interview with The Academic Times. "Instead of finding the PTSD gene or the bipolar gene, where it really jumps out as being 1,000 times more prevalent in the disease population, what we find in these studies is 30 genes, each of them contributing a little bit." The researchers found a series of genes that could help predict which patients will develop PTSD following trauma: 11 causal driver genes related to major depressive disorder, 13 genes related to PTSD, and 22 genes related to both conditions, which often co-occur.

> I’m glad that they are researching this area and making progress. It is intresting to read that genetics play a ’big?’ role in who.. gets.. PTSD and who doesn’t.

> Even tho that I have PTSD, I don’t really know how it works and even less about genetics but.. Hope it helps people and allows better treatment for the group that poses a bigger chance of.. recieving/contracting? PTSD.

## Adopting a plant-based diet can help shrink a person’s carbon footprint. However, improving efficiency of livestock production will be a more effective strategy for reducing emissions, as advances in farming have made it possible to produce meat, eggs and milk with a smaller methane footprint.

> The page says people are less likely to adopt a plant-based diet, so spending money on reducing methane emissions from meat farming is the better investment.

## Waking up just one hour earlier could reduce a person's risk of major depression by 23%. The study of 840,000 people, represents some of the strongest evidence yet that chronotype--a person's propensity to sleep at a certain time --influences depression risk.

`/u/WithoutYouStatements` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/nmz3tz/waking_up_just_one_hour_earlier_could_reduce_a/):

> The title is somewhat misleading in that it makes it seem like forcing oneself to wake up earlier is something a person could do to lower their risk of depression. In reality, the study found that a genetic predisposition to be the kind of person that naturally prefers to wake up earlier is associated with a lower risk of depression. The study explicitly states that the objective is to "examine the association of genetically proxied morning diurnal preference with depression risk using mendelian randomization." This study does not demonstrate that a person with a genetic preference to wake up later could enjoy the benefits of lower depression risk by setting their alarm to make themselves wake up earlier. It's only suggests that people whose circadian rhythm is naturally set to wake up earlier might have a lower risk of depression with the underlying cause still open to speculation.

## Scientists discover brain cells that compete to sustain or suppress traumatic memories. The findings could provide important insights into human conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and associated problems such as alcohol use disorder (AUD)

Summary of [original article](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/scientists-discover-brain-cells-compete-sustain-or-suppress-traumatic-memories):

> Two clusters of brain cells compete to promote either the persistence or disappearance of traumatic memories, according to a new study conducted in mice. "For other people who have experienced trauma the fearful memories persist, and can adversely affect their ability to engage in everyday activities. These fearful memories can continue even though a person may repeatedly encounter cues associated with a traumatic experience without a harm. The current study sheds light on the specific neural circuits that may underlie the persistence and the extinction of fearful memories associated with trauma." In a series of behavioral in vivo brain imaging and neurophysiology studies, NIAAA scientists collaborated with researchers in the United States, Switzerland and Germany to assess the potential roles of ITCs as mice learned to associate a cue with a foot-shock, and then extinguished the association by no longer pairing the cue with a foot-shock.

> Two clusters of brain cells compete to promote either the persistence or disappearance of traumatic memories, according to a new study conducted in mice. The findings could provide important insights into human conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and associated problems such as alcohol use disorder (AUD) that can arise from the persistence of traumatic memories. The new research, led by scientists at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their colleagues in Switzerland, is reported in the journal Nature.
> 
> “Over time, the distress of having experienced trauma will subside for some people, as memories of the trauma cease to provoke a fearful response,” says NIAAA Director Dr. George F. Koob. “For other people who have experienced trauma, however, the fearful memories persist, and can adversely affect their ability to engage in everyday activities. These fearful memories can continue even though a person may repeatedly encounter cues associated with a traumatic experience without a harm. The current study sheds light on the specific neural circuits that may underlie the persistence and the extinction of fearful memories associated with trauma.”
> 
> Scientists led by Andrew Holmes, Ph.D., chief of NIAAA’s Laboratory of Behavioral and Genomic Neuroscience, examined clusters of neurons, known as intercalated cells or ITCs, that are packed tightly around the mouse amygdala. Found deep within the temporal lobes of mammals’ brains, the amygdala is well-known as a hub for processing emotions. It is therefore a likely actor in the brain systems that underlie the formation of fearful memories associated with certain environmental cues and the successful extinction of those memories when the same cues later predict no harm.

## Astronomers create largest map of the universe’s dark matter using artificial intelligence methods to analyze images of 100m galaxies and it could challenge Einstein’s theory of relativity.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/27/astronomers-create-largest-map-universe-dark-matter-einstein):

> Astronomers are able to map the existence of dark matter by looking at light travelling to Earth from distant galaxies; if the light has been distorted, this means there is matter in the foreground, bending the light as it comes towards us. Using artificial intelligence methods to analyse images of 100m galaxies, members of the international Dark Energy Survey team - a collaborative effort to reveal the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is driving the expansion of our universe - have created a map that covers a quarter of the sky of the southern hemisphere. Dr Niall Jeffrey, of University College London and École Normale Supérieure, Paris, who co-led the project, said: "It shows us new parts of the universe that we've never seen before. We can really see this cosmic web structure, including these enormous structures called cosmic voids, which are very low-density regions of the universe where there are very few galaxies and less matter."

> I wouldn’t be surprised if something is more accurate than Einstein’s theories of relativity but that doesn’t mean they would be thrown out. For example Newtonian physics is still taught to high schoolers even though relativity is more accurate. Why, because it’s still mostly accurate about how the universe for moderately sized things like planets* and objects on earth that are about human scale.

> *provided they aren’t near a star or another body that has immense gravity, ex. Mercury and others
