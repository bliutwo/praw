## According to a study, people discriminate against atheists when it comes to the expression of beliefs in the workplace. Across 3 studies, people were consistently less likely to say they would allow an atheist — compared to a Christian or Muslim — to sport a symbol of their beliefs in the workplace.

## Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses showed that, in several of the countries worst affected by COVID-19 – namely Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Mexico – excess deaths were more than 50% above the expected annual mortality rate

> Interesting how regions which handled the pandemic well (New Zealand, Taiwan, etc) actually have negative eccess deaths - would be interesting to dig into how their Covid policies helped in other areas (less flu? traffic deaths?)

## Scientists have discovered that the beneficial effects of physical exercise may in part result from changes to the structure of our DNA. They found for the first time, that exercise rewires the enhancers in regions of our DNA that are known to be associated with the risk to develop disease.

> While it is widely known that regular physical exercise decreases the risk of virtually all chronic illnesses, the mechanisms at play are not fully known. Now scientists at the University of Copenhagen have discovered that the beneficial effects of physical exercise may in part result from changes to the structure of our DNA. These changes are referred as ‘epigenetic’.
> 
> DNA is the molecular instruction manual found in all our cells. Some sections of our DNA are genes, which are instructions for building proteins – the body’s building blocks – while other sections are called enhancers that regulate which genes are switched on or off, when, and in which tissue. The scientists found, for the first time, that exercise rewires the enhancers in regions of our DNA that are known to be associated with the risk to develop disease.
> 
> “Our findings provide a mechanism for the known beneficial effects of exercise. By connecting each enhancer with a gene, we further provide a list of direct targets that could mediate this effect,” says Professor Romain Barrès from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, the senior author of the research, which was published in Molecular Metabolism.

## Double-Charm Tetraquark Discovered at the Large Hadron Collider

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/what-to-know-about-the-newly-discovered-tetraquark-at-t-1847396650):

> Protons and neutrons are both made up of three quarks, but the newly discovered hadron particle is made of four, making it a species of tetraquark. Exotic particles like this can be created within accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, but they pop into and out of existence extremely quickly. The new tetraquark is the first exotic hadron that's "Doubly charmed," meaning its two charm quarks are present alongside antiquarks that aren't charmed.

`/u/NohPhD` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ox6996/doublecharm_tetraquark_discovered_at_the_large/):

> What the article doesn’t explicitly state is whether the discovery was predicted in advance by the Standard Model or whether the discovery ‘breaks’ the Standard Model.
> 
> Implicitly, it sounds like the discovery validates the Standard Model since someone was able to suss out a prediction before the discovery, but I could be wrong.
> 
> Any hardron boffins out there that care to comment?
> 
> If this discovery ‘breaks’ the Standard Model, then it would be a very big deal. 
> 
> If this discovery validates the Standard Model, meh…

## A research game called Big Robber might help to explain why a banker would steal money from clients but buy a warm meal for a homeless person: individuals tend to be selfish in their dealings with large groups of people, although they can be generous to just one other person.

> One can steal from a faceless entity and be very concerned about individuals facing hardships similar to the one experienced by the robbers.   
>    
> It's also very hard to have empathy for a group of people that has lots of power / money.

## Red markings on a stalagmite dome in a cave system in southern Spain were created by Neanderthals more than 60,000 years ago, a new study says. The staining was applied by a process of splattering and blowing about 20,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe, the research suggests.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58070141):

> Red markings on a stalagmite dome in a cave system in southern Spain were created by Neanderthals more than 60,000 years ago, a new study says. A new study published in the journal PNAS supports the view that the red ochre pigments discovered in three caves in the Iberian Peninsula are a form of Neanderthal cave art. In 2014, experts said that an engraving found at a separate cave in Gibraltar provided compelling evidence for Neanderthal art.

## American states with more competitive party systems spend more on education, health, and transportation. "This spending leads to longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, better educational outcomes, and higher incomes." [Data from the 50 American states for the period 1880–2010]

Summary of [original article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/life-literacy-and-the-pursuit-of-prosperity-party-competition-and-policy-outcomes-in-50-states/4DD3750D110D228E18ABDBD9F30E089C):

> Why have some states prospered, while others have faltered? What set some states on a path to higher growth, a broader expansion of educational opportunities, or an earlier elimination of illiteracy? Why have some states been able to reduce infant mortality rates more sharply than others and even seen something as essential as the life expectancies of their residents grow more rapidly? LINKING PARTY COMPETITION TO DEVELOPMENT Our argument is that party competition plays a critical role in determining whether states invest in programs promoting the public welfare and that these programs do accelerate development. Footnote 6 The fact that shifting levels of party competition result in substantively large and statistically significant effects on public investments and on the lives of state residents offers an important parallel between levels of democratization across the world and levels of party competition within the United States.

> The county I live in is the poorest in my state.  Things have been bad and getting worse for many years, yet the state legislature never spends money to help rebuild our economy.  The Democrat candidates have won every state level election in this county since FDR.  This means that the Republicans, who hold an overwhelming majority in the state legislature, don't want to spend any money or political capital here because it will not help them win elections in an overwhelmingly Democrat county.  They prefer to spend money in counties where there is a close race between them and the Democrats.  Conversely, the Democrats won't spend any money or political capital here because they don't need to, they know they will always win elections and they too prefer spending money in counties where the elections can swing either way.  As long as we locals continue to always vote for one party the state legislature will never have a political motive to do anything to help us.
