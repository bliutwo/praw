## Researchers identify a new personality construct that describes “an ongoing feeling that the self is a victim”, the Tendency for Interpersonal Victimhood (TIV). It involves 4 dimensions: moral elitism, a lack of empathy, the need for recognition, and rumination.

## Gene therapy injection in one eye surprises scientists by improving vision in both. Injecting a gene therapy vector into one eye of someone suffering from LHON, the most common cause of mitochondrial blindness, significantly improves vision in both eyes, scientists have found.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/gene-therapy-injection-in-one-eye-surprises-scientists-by-improving-vision-in-both):

> LHON affects a specific type of retinal cells, known as retinal ganglion cells, causing optic nerve degeneration and rapidly worsening vision in both eyes. The researchers injected rAAV2/2-ND4 - a viral vector containing modified cDNA - into the vitreous cavity at the back of one eye of 37 patients who had suffered vision loss for between 6 to 12 months. International coordinating investigator and neuro-ophthalmologist Dr Yu-Wai-Man, from Cambridge's Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, said: "We expected vision to improve in the eyes treated with the gene therapy vector only. Rather unexpectedly, both eyes improved for 78% of patients in the trial following the same trajectory over 2 years of follow-up."

> Some are hypothesising this to be related to the particular organisation of the anatomical pathways of the neurons of the eye. 
> 
> The eye is actually an outgrowth of the diencephalon during embryonic development, so is very much part of the brain - it is central nervous system tissue. 
> 
> The optic nerve travels towards the brain to transmit visual input from the eye via 'electrical signalling'. Fibres corresponding to the half of the retina (complex layer at back of eye) closest to the nose cross over at the optic chiasm (shaped like an X), which then moves to the other half of the brain (e.g. *left* eye nasal fibres go to the *right* brain)
> 
> They could probably test this hypothesis by conducting visual field testing (automated perimetry) and see if vision more so corresponding to the nasal retina (i.e. vision on the *temporal* side) exhibits most of the improvement. At the level of vision involved in Leber's, where many patients are legally blind, I'd guess that any visual gains would be related to visual fields rather than central visual acuity (macula/fovea).

## Wielding a gun makes a shooter perceive others as wielding a gun, too - the “gun embodiment effect” - finds a new randomized controlled trial. Accidental shootings of unarmed victims may sometimes happen because the shooter misperceived the victim as also having a gun.

Summary of [original article](https://natsci.source.colostate.edu/wielding-a-gun-makes-a-shooter-perceive-others-as-wielding-a-gun-too/):

> The researchers found strong evidence that when holding a gun, participants were a little slower to make their judgment about whether the other person was also holding a gun. "It's as if, when they're holding a gun, they are prone to see a gun," Witt said. If 100 officers wielding guns interact with 10 unarmed people a day for 100 days, in these 100,000 interactions, our data suggest there were will be 1,000 misperceptions of an unarmed person as holding a gun."

`/u/lapstrake` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/ka0lm2/wielding_a_gun_makes_a_shooter_perceive_others_as/):

> If you read the article and not just the headline, it seems like a very small increase of mistaking a gun and actually a slower response time to making a decision. 
> 
> "They also found that holding a gun affected participants’ accuracy, with a 1% greater likelihood to misperceive the other person as having a gun too."
> 
> "The researchers found strong evidence that when holding a gun, participants were a little slower to make their judgment about whether the other person was also holding a gun."

> The headline doesn't really match the article, for whatever that's worth.

## Poor nutrition in school years may have created 20cm height gap across nations

Summary of [original article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/207893/poor-nutrition-school-years-have-created/):

> The study, which used data from 65 million children aged five to 19 years old in 193 countries, revealed that school-aged children's height and weight, which are indicators of their health and quality of their diet, vary enormously around the world. Global height ranking for the UK has worsened over the past 35 years, with 19-year-old boys falling from 28th tallest in 1985 to 39th in 2019, and 19-year-old girls from 42nd to 49th. The study also assessed children's Body Mass Index - a measure of height to weight ratio, which gives an indication of whether a person has a healthy weight for their height. Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author of the study from Imperial's School of Public Health said: "Children in some countries grow healthily to five years, but fall behind in school years. This shows that there is an imbalance between investment in improving nutrition in pre-schoolers, and in school-aged children and adolescents. This issue is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools are closed throughout the world, and many poor families are unable to provide adequate nutrition for their children."

> >	For example, 19-year old boys in China in 2019 were 8 cm taller than in 1985, with their global rank changing from 150th tallest in 1985 to 65th in 2019.

> 8 centimeters is a lot.

> This is what happens when a country develops their middle class.

## Dogs may never learn that every sound of a word matters. Despite their great hearing, dogs cannot tell the difference between words which differ in only one speech sound (dog vs dig), finds a new brain wave study. This may explain why the number of words dogs learn to recognize remains low.

## "National Lawful Use of Guns Survey," by Michael Siegel PhD at Boston University, identifies reasons why gun owners don't trust gun researchers (peer reviewed science within 6 months)

> This is a nice, rare look into how gun owners actually perceive the conversation - and I think correctly. There's no question that a good number of people on the gun-control side of the discussion clearly want to ban guns. If we want to decrease gun violence, we might have to contend with the fact that responsible gun owners are reluctant to even come to the table when that table is also attended by people who are primarily interested in taking their guns. 
> 
> In what other dialogue would we expect that kind of diplomacy between two intractable, diametrically opposed interests?
