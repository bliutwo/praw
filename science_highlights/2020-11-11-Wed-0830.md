## Sleep loss hijacks brain’s activity during learning. Getting only half a night’s sleep, as many medical workers and military personnel often do, hijacks the brain’s ability to unlearn fear-related memories. It might put people at greater risk of conditions such as anxiety and PTSD

> So, this means missing sleep after a highly stressful/embarrasing/or trauma filled day could lead to those memories failing to suppress and leading to anxiety and/or ptsd?

## A small minority of “superspreader” points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants and religious establishments account for a large majority of COVID-19 infections and restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2923-3?T=AU):

> The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models which capture the effects of changes in mobility on virus spread1. The Supplementary Methods section describes our comparison of SafeGraph mobility data to Google mobility data, where we find high correlation; sensitivity analyses of the model and tests of model identifiability, a detailed description of how we estimated dynamic mobility networks from raw SafeGraph data using iterative proportional fitting. The Supplementary Discussion section covers further discussion of the racial and socioeconomic disparities predicted by our model; limitations of the model and mobility dataset.

> This is so common in complex systems where you see a few key factors dominating the outcome (kind of similar to Pareto distributions). Target your efforts there and the results are much more noticeable. Pandemic response has so far been focused on widespread linear-style adjustments whereas a key influencer approach with some kind of power law assumptions would be preferable (in my opinion).

## 68% of the tested mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts had evidence of COVID-19 infection, with strains with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within mink farms.

Summary of [original article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/11/09/science.abe5901):

> Despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, transmission occurred between mink farms in three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. The sequences generated from mink farms and from mink farm employees were compared with the national database consisting of around 1,775 WGS. To discriminate between community acquired infections and mink farm related SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to determine the potential risk for people living close to mink farms, WGS was also performed on 34 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, sampled from 04-03-2020 until 29-04-2020, from individuals who live in the same four-digit postal code area as the first four mink farms. These local sequences, sampled in a proxy of around 19 km2, reflected the general diversity of SARS-CoV-2 seen in the Netherlands and were not related to the clusters of mink sequences found on the mink farms, thereby indicating no spill-over to people living in close proximity to mink farms had occurred and that the sequences from SARS-CoV-2 infected animals and farm workers clustered by farm.

> But if it can easy jump species then even a worldwide vaccine wont eliminate it.  Because we'd have to not just give it to every person; we'd have to give it to every **mammal**.

## Two-thirds have long COVID symptoms 7 weeks after hospital discharge

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/two-thirds-have-long-covid-symptoms-7-weeks-after-hospital-discharge/):

> More than two-thirds of patients hospitalised due to coronavirus continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms more than seven weeks after being discharged, a new study suggests. "Patients whose COVID-19 illness is serious enough for them to require hospital care often continue to suffer significant symptoms for many weeks after their discharge," she said. In the study published in the medical journal Thorax, clinical teams set up a post-COVID follow up clinic to review both the psychological and physiological symptoms of discharged patients.

## Conservatives tend to see expert evidence & personal experience as more equally legitimate than liberals, who put a lot more weight on scientific perspective. The study adds nuance to a common claim that conservatives want to hear both sides, even for settled science that’s not really up for debate.

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/conservatives-value-personal-stories-more-than-liberals-do-when-evaluating-scientific-evidence-149132):

> Conservatives tend to see expert evidence and personal experience as more equally legitimate than liberals, who put a lot more weight on the scientific perspective, according to our new study published in the journal Political Psychology. Though both liberals and conservatives tended to see the researcher as more legitimate overall, conservatives see less of a difference in legitimacy between the expert and the dissenter. In stripping away political interest, we have revealed something more basic about how conservatives and liberals differ in the ways they interact with evidence.

## People with a greater sense of entitlement are less likely to comply with COVID-19 health guidelines, such as washing their hands more often and social distancing, according to a new study

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/11/psychological-entitlement-predicts-non-compliance-with-covid-19-health-guidelines-study-finds-58508):

> "In previous research, my adviser, Doctor Emily Zitek, demonstrated that feelings of psychological entitlement can lead others to fail to follow the rules, especially rules they perceive are unfair. And so we became interested in understanding if people higher in psychological entitlement are similarly less likely to follow the COVID-19 health guidelines," Schlund said. "As we predicted, people higher in psychological entitlement reported less compliance with the COVID-19 health guidelines than people lower in psychological entitlement. For example, people higher in psychological entitlement were more likely to report that they would still attend parties if they felt like it, and that they were not engaging in social distancing, making efforts to wash their hands more, or even simply following the rules put in place by their state," Schlund told PsyPost. "Our research also makes an important contribution to our understanding of psychological entitlement. In one of the most influential models of psychological entitlement, Grubbs and Exline propose that psychological entitlement can increase one's vulnerability to psychological distress. We found that psychological entitlement can also increase one's susceptibility to contracting a potentially severe illness. Thus, being entitled may pose detrimental effects both psychologically and physically."

> A study at least 25 years ago looked at this and found that surgeons were no more likely to wash their hands in a public restroom than most other professions, despite saying that they wash every time.  Social workers and health inspectors were the most likely group to actually wash.

## Social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have also protected against many other diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. But susceptibility to those other diseases could be increasing, resulting in large outbreaks when masking and distancing stop

Summary of [original article](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/09/large-delayed-outbreaks-endemic-diseases-possible-following-covid-19-controls):

> The researchers used an epidemiological model based on historic RSV data and observations of the recent decline in RSV cases to examine the possible impact of COVID-19 NPIs on future RSV outbreaks in the United States and Mexico. These outbreaks were often delayed following the end of the NPI period, with peak cases projected to occur in many locations in winter 2021-22. "The decrease in cases of influenza and RSV - as well as the possible future increase we project - is arguably the broadest global impact of NPIs across a variety of human diseases that we've seen," said co-author Bryan Grenfell.

## To avoid the problem of inbreeding, female banded mongooses lead their groups into fights then try to mate with enemy males in the chaos of battle, new research shows. "Exploitative leadership" of this kind, which is also seen in human warfare, leads to frequent and damaging conflicts.

Summary of [original article](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_824622_en.html):

> The research team - led by the University of Exeter and the University of Cambridge - say females start fights for the genetic benefits of finding unrelated males. "Females start fights between groups to gain genetic benefits from mating with outsiders, while the males within their group - and the group as a whole - pay the costs." "Professor Rufus Johnstone of the University of Cambridge, who led the theoretical research, said:"Exploitative leadership in banded mongooses helps to explain why intergroup violence is so costly in this species compared to other animals.

> You mean... platoon commanders also lead the troops to fight... to mate with enemy males in the chaos of battle? Yep, I can see that leading to frequent and damaging conflicts.
