## Research has found that watching Donald Trump’s White House briefings was associated with reduced intentions to follow public health guidelines intended stop the spread of COVID in 2020, indicating that the type of media people consume during the pandemic is related to their beliefs about the virus.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/americans-who-used-trump-briefings-to-get-covid-19-information-were-less-willing-to-wear-a-mask-and-socially-distance-study-finds-61593):

> "This study found that depending on the main information source during the COVID-19 pandemic, people differently perceive the risk and show different levels of intentions to adopt risk preventive behaviors. Such results suggest that in times when there can be abundant false and misleading information, the importance of accurate, fair, and balanced risk information comes to the fore. Also, this study informs average news consumers of the necessity of balanced media use during public health crises like COVID-19.". Those who frequently consumed conservative media and used Trump's briefings to obtain information were less likely to view coronavirus as a severe health problem, less likely to view public health advice as effective, and less likely to view public health advice as easy to follow. Participants who used liberal and traditional media also viewed themselves as being at greater risk of being infected by the deadly virus, while those who used social media to get information about COVID-19 perceived themselves as being less at risk.

> I'd be careful about the conclusions drawn from this. The study doesn't say this, but it seems almost reasonable to assume that watching these briefings made people not follow guidelines. It's entirely possible (even likely in my opinion) that people inclined to watch the briefings were already predisposed to not follow guidelines.

## Giving compliments makes us anxious, but new research shows that praising people has huge benefits – for both parties. If you do have a kind thought that marks genuine respect for the other person, the message of the scientific research is clear: share it.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210722-why-we-dont-dole-out-many-compliments-but-should):

> As the participants filled in a rather dull questionnaire, an actor - posing as an introductory psychology student - struck up a conversation that involved casually complimenting the participant's clothing. The effects of the flattery were dramatic, with 79% of the participants offering to help with the event publicity, compared with only 46% of participants in a control group, who had not received the compliment. The researchers then delivered these compliments to the recipient, piecemeal over the following week, with one compliment a day.

## Cities That Reduced Arrests For Minor Offenses Also Saw Fewer Police Shootings

Summary of [original article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-arresting-fewer-people-for-minor-offenses-can-help-reduce-police-shootings/):

> Despite the effect these changes have had in reducing violent encounters with the police, these efforts have still experienced significant backlash, particularly from some in law enforcement who have blamed rising murder rates on police "Pulling back" and being "Defunded." This criticism has intensified as murder rates have risen, even though most cities' police budgets weren't cut by much in 2021 and murders still ticked up in cities that increased their police budgets. In this time period, the U.S. Department of Justice also initiated reforms in 12 major cities through consent decrees, MOAs or the Collaborative Reform Initiative, with cities that underwent these reforms, like Newark and Baltimore, making far larger reductions in low-level arrests and police shootings. Cities that made fewer arrests for low-level offenses did not see a substantial reduction in violent crime arrests, suggesting a more lenient approach to low-level offenses has not resulted in police being less responsive to serious public safety threats.

> What about enacting fewer laws? Individually selling loose cigarettes should not be considered a crime.

## A new study shows that people with chronic pain have an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotions. This imbalance could be making it harder for them to keep negative emotions in check

Summary of [original article](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/chronic-pain-might-impact-how-brain-processes-emotions):

> Now, a new study led by UNSW Sydney and NeuRA shows that people with chronic pain have an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotions. The results show that participants with chronic pain had significantly lower levels of GABA than the control group - a pattern that was consistent regardless of their type of chronic pain. "Together, our studies show there's really a disruption in how the brain cells are talking to each other," says A/Prof. Gustin, who has been researching chronic pain for over 20 years.
