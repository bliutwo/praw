## RETRACTION: "Meta-analysis of randomized trials of ivermectin to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection"

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/pa343g/retraction_metaanalysis_of_randomized_trials_of/):

> Half of adults with ADHD have had a substance use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is most common among adults aged 20-39 with ADHD, followed by cannabis use disorder and other drug use disorders. The protein encoded by the gene could be a new drug target.

## Half of adults with ADHD have had a substance use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is most common among adults aged 20-39 with ADHD, followed by cannabis use disorder and other drug use disorders. More than one quarter of those with ADHD had major depression

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/924775):

> Even after considering factors such as age, race, income, education, childhood adversities and other mental illness, young adults with ADHD were still 69% more likely to have had a substance use disorder when compared to their peers without ADHD. Controlling for lifetime history of mental illness and childhood adversities caused the largest attenuation of the ADHD-SUD relationship. Young adults with ADHD were also three times more likely to experience an illicit drug disorder when compared to their peers without ADHD. "One potential explanation for the extremely high rate of illicit drug use among those with ADHD is the accelerated gateway hypothesis," said co-author Senyo Agbeyaka, a recent University of Toronto MSW graduate who is a social worker at University Health Network. The data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health, a nationally representative sample of 270 respondents aged 20-39 with ADHD and 6,602 without ADHD. The findings of our study underline the extreme vulnerability of young adults with ADHD. "There is a clear need to develop prevention and treatment programs to address substance use issues among those with ADHD, while also promoting mental health and addressing childhood adversities," said Fuller-Thomson.

> I just learned about BVD binocular vision dysfunction. Apparently a large amount of ADHD people suffer from it without realizing what it is.
> BVD is a visual condition where the line of sight from one eye tends to be slightly out of alignment with the line of sight from the other eye (usually vertical) and this puts a heavy strain on the eye muscles as they are constantly trying to correct the alignment to achieve single focus leading to headaches, nausea, blurry vision, trouble focusing reading skipping lines, anxiety, and fear of open spaces, difficulty maintaining eye contact, bad hand-eye coordination or difficulty walking straight or drifting while walking and sleep difficulties.
>  If you randomly learned that covering one eye helps you focus to read there's a good chance you need to ask an optometrist about BVD.
> You can still have 20/20 vision and have BVD which is why it mostly goes undiagnosed because it's just not tested for often. This is crazy considering BVD is present in as many as 50% of children that have been diagnosed with ADHD and other learning disabilities.

>  Edit: It can be fixed or find some symptom relief with prism glasses... I uh forgot also light sensitivity is a common symptom.
> tilting your head subconsciously which can cause neck pain. Motion sickness.
> I made this post very early sorry I missed some things
> after reading everyone who is thanking me I couldn't help but feel sad and angry knowing so many people's lives could have been different growing up by a simple fix that went overlooked.

## Around one in five scientists report being put under pressure from the bodies funding their research including through suppression, delays and alteration of findings, a new global survey (n = 104) has found

Summary of [original article](https://labdownunder.com/one-in-five-researchers-report-suppression-by-funders-study-finds/):

> Additional study is also needed on ways to reduce suppression in different funding groups, the researchers noted. "Suppression still exists among public-good researchers, with this study suggesting rates of suppression for a single trial may be as high as one in five. Prevention is key and these suggestions, similar to those previously described, need to be adopted in order to thwart the occurrence of suppression of public-good health research," they wrote. "As it is unlikely that instances of suppression will ever truly be stopped, further research needs to be conducted to determine ways of handling suppression when they do happen at the researcher level, as well as reporting procedures in place if instances of suppression do occur."

## Researchers Draw New Connections Between Aging and Mitochondrial Health

> 
> >Since then the researchers have run several clinical trials to test how urolithin A supplements affect humans. In a phase I clinical trial reported in 2019 in Nature Metabolism, they showed that urolithin A was safe for human consumption and that it increased expression of mitochondrial genes in muscle.
> 
> >According to Anurag Singh, the chief medical officer at Amazentis,  a supplement with a precise, clinically tested dose of urolithin A is needed. The metabolite is formed by gut microbiota when precursor compounds, called ellagitannins—commonly found in foods like pomegranates, berries and walnuts—are consumed.

## An engineered "glue" inspired by barnacle cement can seal bleeding organs in 10-15 seconds. It was tested on pigs and worked faster than available surgical products, even when the pigs were on blood thinners.

Summary of [original article](https://www.wired.com/story/this-barnacle-inspired-glue-seals-bleeding-organs-in-seconds/):

> In a study published this month in Nature Biomedical Engineering, his team demonstrated how this arthropod-like glue can stop bleeding in seconds. Anesthetized rats bleeding from 2-millimeter knicks in their heart chamber muscles received either the barnacle glue or one of two commercial alternatives: Surgicel and CoSeal. Only the glue overcame the pressure produced by the beating heart to form a seal-the bleeding stopped in seconds.

`/u/sonofabutch` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/parfat/an_engineered_glue_inspired_by_barnacle_cement/):

> This was the premise of an episode of *The Odd Couple* fifty years ago. Oscar’s dentist invents a fast-acting, super-strong dental glue based on barnacles. It works great until Oscar, talking about how great the glue works with potential investors, gets “dry mouth” from being nervous and his filling comes loose. It turns out the barnacle glue only works when wet!

## Researchers have discovered a potential new way to fight endometriosis—a disease that affects an estimated one in 10 women. The approach blocks a particular gene, reducing discomfort and inflammation, at least in mice.

## A police raid in Brazil led to the discovery of the most complete fossil of a tapejarid — a toothless, Cretaceous-era predator with a large crested head that lived during the time of the dinosaurs.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/police-raid-results-in-exceptional-fossil):

> The Federal Police conducted a sweeping investigation into the country's illegal fossil trade, ultimately recovering more than 3,000 fossil specimens from the Brazilian states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. What you need to know first - Fossils might seem like a strange thing for the police to find, but in recent decades, police raids have uncovered everything from dinosaur eggs in Spain and Australia to ancient fish fossils in the United States. Before the police raid turned up this complete fossil skeleton, researchers had only skull specimens to analyze Tupandactylus navigans.
