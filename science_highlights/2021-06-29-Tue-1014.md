## New climate science could cause wave of litigation against businesses – study | Experts say scientific advances are making it easier to attribute the damages of climate breakdown to companies’ activities

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/28/new-climate-science-could-cause-wave-of-litigation-against-businesses-study):

> Businesses could soon be facing a fresh wave of legal action holding them to account for their greenhouse gas emissions, owing to advances in climate science, experts have warned. Rupert Stuart-Smith, researcher at the Oxford University sustainable law programme, and lead author of a new study, said more such cases were likely to be successful, as new science was making it possible to attribute the damages of climate breakdown more directly to companies' activities. Using more up-to-date science can overcome some of these difficulties, according to Stuart-Smith and colleagues, in a paper entitled Filling the Evidentiary Gap in Climate Ligitation, published in the peer-review journal Nature Climate Change on Monday.

> I hope legislation like this sticks to being aimed at companies. I feel like it's been too easy for companies to pass the blame onto the consumers.
> 
> I wrote a dystopian idea for r/scificoncepts about a pollution tax that was initially aimed at companies but then passed on to the general public. The largest polluters also have the most money and power. So I can see them corrupting something as beneficial as this for their own needs.
> 
> I'm optimistic but I can almost guarantee they will still try to skip any blame. What if we put tracers or nanomachines onto every molecule of pollutant. Can't get out of that so easily.

## Study finds US life expectancy behind other rich nations

Summary of [original article](https://kvoa.com/news/top-stories/2021/06/23/study-us-life-expectancy-behind-other-rich-nations/):

> A new study finds life expectancy in the United States lags behind other high-income nations by an average of nearly five years. In 2018, life expectancy in the U.S. was 78.7 years. The life expectancy gap ballooned to nearly five years in 2020 after the U.S. experienced a particularly high mortality rate.

> Pretty much only a small percentage of us Americans can afford to go to the hospital. I had to get an x-ray and nothing was wrong and I went home with a $7,000 bill. Oh by the way? I asked them not to X-ray me.

## NYU AD scientists develop a revolutionary chemical that does NOT kill cancer. Instead, it re-activates the cells own ability to detect a problem and commit suicide. Exciting potential treatment that does not harm normal cells.

## Engineers at MIT and Harvard have designed a face mask prototype that can diagnose the wearer with Covid-19 within about 90 minutes, and could also be adapted to detect other viruses or even nerve agents.

## A new study finds dinosaurs began declining 10 million years before the infamous asteroid hit, challenging our popular beliefs in how dinosaurs went extinct. Climate change may have been a significant factor in their decline, the researchers say.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/new-dinosaur-study-debunks-famous-extinction):

> The dual blows that killed the dinosaurs were not necessarily the double asteroids, but environmental and population factors that emerged much earlier, the researchers say. The rates of new species of dinosaurs emerging could not keep up with the extinction rates, leading to a decline in dinosaur diversity. "Studying dinosaurs is a complex but passionate topic, and I anticipate that our results will motivate people to look at their data and results through a new lens," Condamine says.

`/u/very_humble` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/oaairb/a_new_study_finds_dinosaurs_began_declining_10/):

> 
> Even today when we think about our long term structures, most of them are lucky to exist on the 100,000 year life span. If we all disappeared tomorrow I wonder what trace could be found of us 50m years later

## Hotels that opened their doors to homeless people in their community during lockdown generated greater positive word-of-mouth marketing than those that offered free accommodation to frontline healthcare workers, finds new University research.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uob-hor062821.php):

> Despite the positive impact on tourists' intentions to share the good news story, the immediate impact on intention to book a visit was the reverse, with people less inclined to book a stay at a hotel that had housed homeless people. "In contrast, the hotels that offered accommodation to homeless people really seemed to move tourists and generate a feeling of warmth and a perception of the hotel as kind and generous. Going beyond the social norm was seen as a marker of genuine concern for social welfare. The hotels were rewarded with a marked intention by tourists to spread positive word of mouth." Over 450 American tourists, who intended to travel after the pandemic, took part in the research and were allocated to one of three experimental scenarios that focused on a hotel's commitment to cleanliness and its cancellation policy as its responses to COVID-19; community support through donating rooms to medical professionals; or to homeless people.

## Spiders are primarily insectivores, but they occasionally expand their menu by catching and eating snakes. A new study shows spiders can outfight snakes 10 to 30 times their size. The largest snakes caught by spiders in this study are up to one meter in length, the smallest only about six cm.

Summary of [original article](https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/snake-eating-spiders.html):

> Spiders are primarily insectivores, but they occasionally expand their menu by catching and eating small snakes. In Australia, brown snakes - which belong to the same family as cobras - often fall prey to redback spiders. Martin Nyffeler says, «These brown snakes are among the most venomous snakes in the world and it's really fascinating to see that they lose fights with spiders.

> **Abstract:**
> 
> >In this paper, 319 incidents of snake predation by spiders are reported based on a comprehensive global literature and social media survey. Snake-catching spiders have been documented from all continents except Antarctica. Snake predation by spiders has been most frequently documented in USA (51% of all incidents) and Australia (29%). The captured snakes are predominantly small-sized with an average body length of 25.9 ± 1.3 cm (median = 27 cm; range: 5.8–100 cm). Altogether >90 snake species from seven families have been documented to be captured by >40 spider species from 11 families. About 60% of the reported incidents were attributable to theridiids (≈0.6–1.1 cm body length), a spider family that uses strong tangle webs for prey capture. Especially the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti Thorell, 1870), the African button spider (Latrodectus indistinctus O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1904), an Israeli widow spider (Latrodectus revivensis Shulov, 1948), and four species of North American widow spiders (Latrodectus geometricus C.L. Koch, 1841, Latrodectus hesperus Chamberlin & Ivie, 1935, Latrodectus mactans (Fabricius, 1775), and Latrodectus variolus Walckenaer, 1837) – equipped with a very potent vertebrate-specific toxin (α-latrotoxin) – have proven to be expert snake catchers. The use of vertebrates as a supplementary food source by spiders represents an opportunity to enlarge their food base, resulting in enhanced survival capability. Interestingly, the snakes captured by spiders also encompasses some species from the families Elapidae and Viperidae known to be highly toxic to humans and other vertebrates. Not only do spiders sometimes capture and kill snakes, quite often the tables are turned – that is, a larger number of arthropod-eating snake species (in particular nonvenomous species in the family Colubridae) include spiders in their diets.
