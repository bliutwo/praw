## Supporters of a political party change their policy views “immediately and substantially” after that party switches its position on an issue, a sign that political elites could be shaping the opinions of voters. Findings call into question whether democracies genuinely represent the views of voters.

> Supporters of a political party change their policy views "Immediately and substantially" after that party switches its position on an issue, new research suggests, a sign that political elites could be shaping the opinions of the voters whose views they're supposed to represent. In an article published in the American Journal of Political Science in November, co-authors Rune Slothuus and Martin Bisgaard of Aarhus University detailed their findings from Danish public opinion surveys that party leaders can fundamentally shift the stances of their followers, causing them in some cases to quickly reverse their views even on high-stakes policy issues. Through surveys of 1,206 Danish citizens between March 2010 and June 2011, the researchers tracked the positions of voters before and after the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party signaled changes in their stances on key, broadly popular social welfare programs, including unemployment benefits and Denmark's early retirement program.

## A new study has found being angry increases your vulnerability to misinformation. Angry people tended to be more confident in the accuracy of their memories, but this increased confidence was actually associated with decreased accuracy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/a-new-study-has-found-being-angry-increases-your-vulnerability-to-misinformation-59061):

> Human memory is prone to error - and new research provides evidence that anger can increase these errors. "My interest in the impact of anger on misinformation came from both real-world experience and research," said study author Michael Greenstein, an assistant professor at Framingham State University. To further induce feelings of anger, those in the anger condition then wrote about a time in their lives when they had been made angry.

## Now We Know Why Platypus Are So Weird - Their Genes Are Part Bird, Reptile, And Mammal

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/platypus-genes-reveal-some-of-the-bizarre-traits-that-come-with-5x-and-5y-chromosomes):

> Using a male platypus, researchers have now created a physical map with a highly accurate platypus genome. The platypus is probably not as dependent on egg proteins as other bird and reptile species, because it can later feed their young through the lactation glands on its skin. While birds and reptiles rely on three genes that encode for major egg proteins, the platypus appears to have lost the majority of these genes roughly 130 million years ago.

## Conservatives are more sensitive to the violation of social norms than liberals.Social norms are underlying rules that guide our social behavior. A person’s sensitivity to social rule-breaking is linked to their political orientation.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/01/conservatives-are-more-sensitive-to-the-violation-of-social-norms-than-leftists-study-finds-59071):

> Social norms are underlying rules that guide our social behavior. The researchers found that those with a right-wing political orientation rated more items as strongly inappropriate than those with left-wing beliefs, suggesting rightists were more sensitive to the breaching of social norms. The authors suggest that a future area of interest would be to investigate whether the breaching of certain social norms is more strongly related to political orientation than the breaching of others.

## Crocodiles today look the same as they did 200 million years ago - new research strongly suggests crocodilians have remained unchanged for such a very long time because they have landed upon an equilibrium state that does not require them to change often

> The crocodiles from 200 million years ago look surprisingly like the ones we know today. Relatives of crocodiles have been around for an extraordinary length of time, their fossil remains having been found in rocks from the early Jurassic period, around 200 million years old. Stranger still, these crocodiles from the age of the dinosaurs often look surprisingly like the crocodilians of today.
