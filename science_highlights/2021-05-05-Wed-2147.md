## Researchers have designed a pasta noodle that can be flat-packed, like Ikea furniture, and then spring to life in water -- all while decreasing packaging waste.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/3d-morphing-pasta-to-alleviate-package-waste):

> Where the trendy mid-century coffee table or cube shelf for records from an Ikea flatpack is a right of passage for many 20-somethings, material scientists have unveiled a way to do the same thing for pasta - making your favorite Italian dish suddenly easier to transport and unexpectedly making it environmentally friendly in the process. In a new study, Yao and her team demonstrate how to construct flat-packed pasta that can twist and contort into a myriad of pasta shapes - from spirals to cones - in just a matter of seconds. What's next - The authors write that future research remains to be done to design more complicated 3D shapes for this pasta and tell Inverse that these methods may also be applied to other food as well.

> That idea is so simple once you see it, but at the same time, absolutely genius.
> 
> I hope this catches on. While they aren't exactly "classic" pasta shapes, I would totally buy these, and the first time someone sees it, it would be such a fun experience.

## New study of 14,000 teens finds that students who were relatively older than their peers in primary school wind up being more popular in high school; in the Netherlands, the effect was about 2.6%; this study is another example showing that school cut-off dates have real impacts.

> "... within a given class, a child who was born in August will be 11 months younger than one born in September, which is a considerable difference at that young age ...  The authors mention that size, strength, sexual maturity, cognitive development, and social skills can vary considerably when one child is almost a year older than another ... Students who are relatively older ... are more likely to be perceived as 'powerful, influential, and more self-confident.' Likewise, the relatively younger students have fewer resources to draw upon when it comes to high school popularity."

## A new Harvard University study found that, in at least 19 states plus Washington, D.C., burning gas now kills more people than coal because of exposure to a deadly type of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that lingers in the air and lodges in lung tissue.

## The number of death penalties imposed increases in US counties with public support for Republican presidential candidates and larger Protestant fundamentalist populations, finds a new study. No direct relationship was found between size of African American populations and reliance on death penalty.

## Rapid blood test to detect cancer: Scientists successfully detected cancerous mutations in tumor cells by analyzing DNA that is free-floating in blood, employing a strip test with results in 10 minutes. The liquid biopsy is less invasive than tissue sampling.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/rapid-blood-test-detects-cancerous-mutations-in-tumor-dna/):

> An experimental test successfully detected cancerous mutations in tumor cells by analyzing their DNA that is free-floating in blood, employing a strip test that displays results within 10 minutes. The genetic code of these cells contains mutations that promote cancerous growth, and the blood-borne DNA fragments - called circulating tumor DNA - have become a popular research subject for new cancer diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. She and her lab are planning to develop a rapid strip test that detects multiple mutations in a single strip.

## Efficient manufacturing could slash cement-based greenhouse gas emissions - Brazil's cement industry can halve its CO2 emissions in next 30 years while saving $700 million, according to new analysis. The production of cement is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases on the planet.

## A new study identifies the earliest human burial in Africa, shedding light on the customs of early Homo sapiens.

Summary of [original article](https://www.inverse.com/science/scientists-find-earliest-burial-in-africa):

> The findings prove that early modern homo sapiens in eastern Africa were burying members of their group between 78,000 to 79,000 years ago - the earliest known finding of a human burial in Africa. There is still a 40,000-year gap between the earliest known human burial in Africa and those found in Eurasia. The presence of little or no displacement of the unstable joints during decomposition points to an interment in a filled space, making the PYS finding the oldest known human burial in Africa.

`/u/joker_of_the_deck` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/n5ih87/a_new_study_identifies_the_earliest_human_burial/):

> question: wouldn't studying burials fall pray to the survivorship bias of the earliest ways of putting the dead to rest?
> 
> what if earlier species had other funeral rituals, like cremation or a dokhma, that did not leave any evidence behind? 
> 
> what would be the best way to confirm/ deny the existence of such rituals?
