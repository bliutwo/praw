## Former SARS patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 appear able to fend off all variants of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation, as well as ones that may soon emerge, a new study suggests.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/covid-19-vaccines-may-trigger-superimmunity-people-who-had-sars-long-ago?utm_campaign=NewsfromScience&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Twitter):

> Wang's team also analyzed antibodies in three other groups: unvaccinated people who currently had COVID-19, along with vaccinated people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 or had never been infected with that virus. The vaccinated SARS survivors were the only cohort whose antibodies neutralized 10 different coronaviruses, according to a new assay Wang's team developed that tests the antibodies' ability to block binding between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domains of different spikes. Wang has yet to identify why these antibodies work so well, which is critical to designing vaccines because the RBDs themselves likely will not trigger production of the wanted immune response.

> So is it possible to rapidly develop a new mRNA vaccine that will help us produce the same antibodies these former SARS patients have?

## Substituting only 10% of daily caloric intake of beef and processed meats for a diverse mix of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and select seafood could reduce, on average, the dietary carbon footprint of a U.S. consumer by one-third and add 48 healthy minutes of life per day.

## New studies hint that the coronavirus may be evolving to become more airborne. The virus appears to spread through the air, but masks reduce the amount of infectious virus.

## Eating fructose appears to alter cells in the digestive tract in a way that enables it to take in more nutrients. These changes could help to explain the well-known link between rising fructose consumption around the world and increased rates of obesity and certain cancers.

## “Blue” hydrogen is worse for the climate than coal, study says

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/blue-hydrogen-pushed-by-gas-companies-harms-climate-more-than-coal-study-says/):

> Blue hydrogen is viewed by some as a bridge fuel, a way to build the hydrogen economy while waiting for green hydrogen prices to come down. At the 3.5 percent leakage rate, blue hydrogen was worse for the climate than burning coal. "Combined emissions of carbon dioxide and methane are greater for gray hydrogen and for blue hydrogen than for any of the fossil fuels," Howarth and Jacobson wrote.

`/u/wwarnout` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/p70snp/blue_hydrogen_is_worse_for_the_climate_than_coal/):

> This sounds like the "clean coal" farse from a few years ago.
> 
> To be fair, H2 is a good fuel, but producing it from methane is not the way to do it.  Producing H2 from renewable energy is a much better alternative, but it's still not very efficient, after considering the losses in production and transportation.  It does have one big advantage over battery-powered EVs, though - you can refuel a fuel cell vehicle in a few minutes.

## Ivermectin doesn't speed recovery from mild COVID-19, study shows

Summary of [original article](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/ivermectin-doesnt-speed-recovery-mild-covid-19-study-shows):

> Seventy-seven percent of the ivermectin group and 81.3% of the placebo group had adverse events, with 7.5% of the former group and 2.5% of the latter group discontinuing treatment as a result. "Cumulatively, the findings suggest that ivermectin does not significantly affect the course of early COVID-19, consistent with pharmacokinetic models showing that plasma total and unbound ivermectin levels do not reach the concentration resulting in 50% of viral inhibition even for a dose level 10-times higher than the approved dose," the authors concluded. "The findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand the effects of ivermectin on other clinically relevant outcomes."

## Scientists reveal how landmark CFC ban gave planet fighting chance against global warming

Summary of [original article](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/scientists-reveal-how-landmark-cfc-ban-gave-planet-fighting-chance-against-global-warming):

> Their new evidence reveals the planet's critical ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere could have been massively degraded sending global temperatures soaring if we still used ozone-destroying chemicals such as CFCs. New modelling by the international team of scientists from the UK, USA and New Zealand, published today in Nature, paints a dramatic vision of a scorched planet Earth without the Montreal Protocol, what they call the "World Avoided". Ozone depleting substances, such as CFCs, are also potent greenhouse gases and previous research has shown that their ban prevented their contribution to global warming through their greenhouse effect. Dr Chris Huntingford of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology said: "This analysis reveals a remarkable linkage, via the carbon cycle, between the two global environmental concerns of damage to the ozone layer and global warming."
