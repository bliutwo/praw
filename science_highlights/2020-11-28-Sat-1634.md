## Sleep deprivation impairs the suppression of unwanted thoughts and memories which enter conscious awareness when individuals confront reminders. Sleep-deprived people experienced significantly more intrusions and unsuccessful suppressions of unwanted thoughts.

Summary of [original article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702620951511):

> Participants initially encoded face-scene pairs by studying them one at a time for 6 s. To reinforce learning and ensure adequate knowledge of the face-scene pairs, we then had participants complete a test phase in which faces were displayed individually for up to 4 s and participants indicated whether they were able to fully visualize the associated scene. Sleep-deprived participants exhibited significantly higher relapse probability scores than did the sleep group, F(1, 57) = 7.08, p =.010, ηp2 =.11, indicating that after initially gaining control over an intrusive thought, they suffered intrusion relapses more than participants who had slept. Prior research suggests that in healthy participants, acute sleep deprivation increases LF-HRV. Replicating this work, our sleep-deprived participants exhibited higher LF-HRV compared with participants who slept.

## High achievement cultures may kill students' interest in math—specially for girls. Girls were significantly less interested in math in countries like Japan, Hong Kong, Sweden and New Zealand. But, surprisingly, the roles were reversed in countries like Oman, Malaysia, Palestine and Kazakhstan.

## Children are willing to make personal sacrifices to punish wrongdoers — and even more so if they believe punishment will teach the transgressor a lesson. Retribution is a driving force in young children’s moral judgement.

> I'd be interested to know more about the kids in their sample. one author says "Children are less exposed to social ideas about how to behave in certain ways" and it seems like the underlying assumption there is "because they have less exposure to ideas, their natural impulses will be more exposed" but that honestly seems like a HUGE assumption to make. it says the kids were between the ages of 4-7, which covers a huge range of developmental milestones. And even the youngest still has 4 years of being punished or disciplined by their own parents at the very least. What if they're not exhibiting natural inclinations as much as they are reflecting what they've observed and learned?

## Scientists have found even when cardiovascular risk factors were optimally controlled, adults with type 2 diabetes had a 21% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 31% higher risk of heart failure, compared to those without diabetes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/well-managed-type-2-diabetes-patients-have-21-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease/):

> Even when cardiovascular risk factors were optimally controlled, adults with type 2 diabetes had a 21% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 31% higher risk of heart failure, compared to those without diabetes. Professor Sarah Wild, co-senior author from the University of Edinburgh, added: "Our team sought to determine how the degree of risk factor control in people in the UK with type 2 diabetes affects CVD risk and mortality compared to people with type 2 diabetes who had all risk factors optimally controlled and to people who do not have type 2 diabetes." "Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: "This research, funded by Diabetes UK, shows that although having type 2 diabetes adds to the risk of developing heart disease, by keeping blood sugars, blood pressure and blood fats in a healthy range, and having a healthy lifestyle - you can minimise that risk."It is also an important reminder that people with type 2 diabetes should not delay taking steps to prevent heart disease.

> “People with type 2 diabetes should attempt to lead healthy lifestyles and be treated for cardiovascular risk factors as early as possible, regardless of whether they have cardiovascular disease or not,” said co-senior author Professor Martin Rutter.
> 
> Co-senior author Professor Darren Ashcroft added: “There is real potential here to reduce the overall impact of type 2 diabetes on future cardiovascular events, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not yet been diagnosed with CVD.”
> 
> Dr Alison Wright based at the University’s Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, and first author for this study, said: “A Swedish study has suggested that people with type 2 diabetes had little or no excess risk of cardiovascular disease events or death when all risk factors are optimally controlled.

## Self-continuity forms the very basis of identity. Every time you use the word 'I', you're referring to a thread that stitches a series of experiences into a tapestry of a lifetime, representing a relationship between the self of your youth with one yet to emerge.

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-confirm-there-is-a-part-of-you-that-remains-you-throughout-your-life?fbclid=IwAR0229vNIBB2xq6O-ckvbl6-B419j9TpFt-pCKx-PRLpnKiLIdBSisfmQbc):

> A new, small psychobiological study weighs in, looking at brain scans to conclude that at least some part of you is indeed consistent as you grow and age. "In conjunction with the previous literature, our results indicate that there is a component that remains stable while another part is more susceptible to change over time." Significantly, neurological descriptions of the specific brain bits responsible for sorting self from stranger can help us better understand why some people don't share this impression.

> 
> They found a speck of brain that responds a certain way to pictures of ourselves in an image recognition task.  Okay, that's actually pretty impressive, but what the heck does it have to do with *anything* described in the title?

## Reduced sleep duration and sleep deprivation significantly correlates with decreased brain white matter integrity in healthy, young adults, which may explain the positive association between sleep duration and overall cognitive performance.

Summary of [original article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25132):

> We hypothesized that short sleep duration and poor quality are associated with reduced cognitive performance with strongest effect sizes for sleep duration, that short sleep duration is associated with lower FA in the SLF, and that reduced FA in this fiber tract positively correlates with cognitive performance and that it mediates the association of sleep duration and cognition. Our findings demonstrate that reported sleep duration, but not subjective sleep quality is associated with both cognitive performance, especially in language subdomains, and white matter integrity of the SLF irrespective of age, sex, or BMI. Moreover, the mediation analysis showed that white matter microstructure mediated the association of sleep duration and cognitive performance. In contrast, our nonlinear analysis revealed no significant association of the coefficient estimate for the squared sleep duration regressor with fractional anisotropy in the SLF. However, our results from the linear analyses demonstrate a positive association of sleep duration with FA in the left SLF and a trend‐level positive association of sleep duration with FA on a whole‐brain approach in several white matter tracts including the bilateral SLF. The white matter integrity of the SLF has been associated with abnormal sleep patterns in several other studies.

## The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team at National Museums NI.

Summary of [original article](https://newatlas.com/science/ireland-first-only-dinosaur-find-confirmed/?utm_source=DamnInteresting):

> The bones of the only dinosaurs to be found on the island of Ireland have been confirmed by a research team led by Dr. Mike Simms, a curator and paleontologist at National Museums NI. Drawing on the expertise of scientists from the University of Portsmouth and Queen's University Belfast, the two bone fragments were found to belong to two different individuals. If you're into dinosaur hunting, Ireland is one of the most frustrating places to ply your trade. "The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Ireland's rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores. The two dinosaur fossils that Roger Byrne found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilized."
