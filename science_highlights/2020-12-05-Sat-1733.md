## Biological diversity evokes happiness in people - More bird species in the vicinity increase life satisfaction of Europeans as much as higher income. 14 additional bird species raise the level of life satisfaction at least as much as an extra 124 Euros per month. (n=26,000)

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/gcfi-bde120420.php):

> Species diversity was measured based on the diversity of avian species, as documented in the European breeding bird atlas. Birds are well-suited as indicators of biological diversity, since they are among the most visible elements of the animate nature - particularly in urban areas. "The Global Assessment 2019 by the World Biodiversity Council IPBES and studies of avian species in agricultural landscapes in Europe clearly show that the biological diversity is currently undergoing a dramatic decline. This poses the risk that human well-being will also suffer from an impoverished nature. Nature conservation therefore not only ensures our material basis of life, but it also constitutes an investment in the well-being of us all," adds Methorst in conclusion.

## CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing successful for a patient with Sickle Cell Disease and another patient with transfusion dependent β-Thalassemia - More than a year later, both patients had clinically improved and no longer needed blood transfusions. (NEJM, 5 Dec 2020)

Summary of [original article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031054):

> Summary Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses γ-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer.

> These single gene defect diseases are going to be the first to be eradicated, but in the future more complicated genetic diseases will be treated too. It's an exciting time to be alive.

## Employees who take charge relatively more in their teams tend to be perceived as more competent and are more likely to emerge as informal leaders. However, such employees are also likely to be seen as less warm and receive less coworker support, especially in teams with a low initiative climate.

## Voyager Probes Spot Previously Unknown Phenomenon in Deep Space. “Foreshocks” of accelerated electrons up to 30 days before a solar flare shockwave makes it to the probes, which now cruise the interstellar medium.

Summary of [original article](https://gizmodo.com/voyager-probes-spot-previously-unknown-phenomenon-in-de-1845793983):

> As the new paper describes, these shock waves are facilitating a previously unseen behavior in the interstellar medium, namely bursts of electrons appearing far ahead of the advancing shock waves. "We detected the electron bursts when the shock waves first touched the magnetic field lines running through the Voyager spacecraft-and that's the mechanism. The shock wave just touches the magnetic field line, and there's a jump at the shock, which reflects and energizes a few of the cosmic ray electrons." "More data will be needed to better understand these results," he said, including more data from Voyager 2, "Which hasn't been in the interstellar medium for long," as well as NASA's upcoming IMAP mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2024.The new paper could improve our understanding of the complex interactions between shock waves and cosmic radiation, not just in the outskirts of our neighborhood but around other stars as well, including exploding stars.

## New study identifies cognitive factors linked to pseudoscientific practices to fight COVID-19. Those with stronger beliefs in conspiracy theories tended to adhere less to safety guidelines, were less willing to get vaccinated, and endorsed more pseudoscientific practices, such as essential oils.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/new-study-identifies-cognitive-factors-linked-to-the-use-of-pseudoscientific-practices-to-fight-covid-19-58714):

> New research provides evidence irrational beliefs and cognitive tendencies play an important role in health behaviors related to COVID-19, such as adherence to COVID-19 safety guidelines and engaging in pseudoscientific practices. The researchers were interested in how these cognitive factors were related to three outcomes: adherence to COVID-19 safety guidelines, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and the use of pseudoscientific practices to combat COVID-19. "We identified a pattern of thinking making people more susceptible to these practices related to COVID-19: primarily proneness to conspiratorial beliefs, and to a class of cognitive biases named Type 1 error."

## A smile, which brings up the corners of the mouth and creates crow's feet around the eyes, can reduce the pain of a needle injection by up to 40%, and also blunt a stressful needle-related physiological response by lowering the heart rate

> A grimace had the same effect as a "genuine smile".  But a non-genuine smile did not.
> 
> The grimace may be more useful.  Getting patients to give a "genuine" rather than fake smile may be difficult when they're facing a needle ("No! I need your smile to have crow's feet!  Do you want this shot or not?!")  Getting them to grimace might be easier.
> 
> Of course that's not as feel-good as "smiles kill pain!"  But that's OK with me.  *Grimace*.

## To decarbonize economy, researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "electrify" economic sectors with wind & solar energy. In some years, we will have to install more than a 100 GW of solar PV and wind power, and to achieve full decarbonization, CO2 prices will have to be a lot higher than today.

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2020/12/04/Early-steady-investment-in-wind-solar-best-way-to-decarbonize-economy/2951607090283/):

> Dec. 4 - To decarbonize the economy, European researchers recommend early, steady efforts to "Electrify" economic sectors with wind and solar energy. Even the early and steady strategy will require periods of aggressive - rapid, even - installation and adoption of wind and solar energy. Even as more and more wind and solar power sources are brought online, the energy system will still need to rely on gas power during so-called "Nightmare weeks" when frigid temperatures trigger peaks in energy demands.

`/u/squirlnutz` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/k790q2/to_decarbonize_economy_researchers_recommend/):

> Nuclear power plants are safe and cheap and generate electricity at night and when the wind isn't blowing.
> 
> It's almost as if our interest really isn't about solving the climate crisis at all.

## Eerie Footage Captures Human Immune Cells Digging a Tunnel Through Tissue. In new experiments, scientists demonstrated how a type of white blood cell, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte, is able to dig tunnels through tissue like a snowplow clearing the way for emergency vehicles. They captured it on camera.
