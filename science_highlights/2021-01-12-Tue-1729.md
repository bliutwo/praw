## Science Discussion Series: Preprints, rushed peer review, duplicated efforts, and conflicts of interest led to confusion and misinformation regarding COVID-19. We're experts who analyzed COVID-19 research - let's discuss!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kvs8gh/science_discussion_series_preprints_rushed_peer/):

> Preprints, lack of data sharing, and rushed peer review have led to confusion for both experts and the lay public alike. We are a global collaboration that has looked at COVID19 research and potential misuses of basic transparency research principles. In medical research, open science is key to gain the trust and support of the public, while ensuring the quality of the research done.

> >The misuse of preprints by some journalists emphasises the need for high quality journalism training.
> 
> Science journalism seems to be getting worse and worse. How much of that do you think is attributed to large social media accounts misinterpreting/sensationalizing the results of a preprint and everyone simply picking it up and blasting it out?
> 
> Should scientists have better (if any) social media training?
> 
> Should Twitter start labeling pre-prints with warning messages similarly to how they have labeled misleading political posts?
> 
> Not to promote anything but a few folks at CDC are really trying to improve open data for the agency: [https://data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/browse)

## A new study suggests more than half of doctors, nurses, and emergency responders involved in COVID-19 care could be at risk for one or more mental health problems, including acute traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, problematic alcohol use, and insomnia.

Summary of [original article](https://healthcare.utah.edu/publicaffairs/news/2021/01/covid-mental-health.php):

> Jan 12, 2021 8:00 AM. The daily toll of COVID-19, as measured by new cases and the growing number of deaths, overlooks a shadowy set of casualties: the rising risk of mental health problems among health care professionals working on the frontlines of the pandemic. A new study, led by University of Utah Health scientists, suggests more than half of doctors, nurses, and emergency responders involved in COVID-19 care could be at risk for one or more mental health problems, including acute traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, problematic alcohol use, and insomnia. "What health care workers are experiencing is akin to domestic combat," says Andrew J. Smith, Ph.D., director of the U of U Health Occupational Trauma Program at the Huntsman Mental Health Institute and the study's corresponding author.

> Doctors already suffer from a significantly higher burnout rate, nurses suffer higher than normal mental health issues.

## There may be a link between political corruption and dividend payouts. Companies headquartered in U.S. states with higher levels of political corruption pay out more to investors through dividends and stock buybacks, according to new research.

Summary of [original article](https://academictimes.com/us-companies-in-more-corrupt-states-pay-higher-dividends-buy-back-more-stocks/):

> Companies headquartered in U.S. states with higher levels of political corruption pay out more to investors through dividends and stock buybacks, according to new research by three Canadian academics. The researchers found that the dividend payouts at firms in high-corruption states is 4% higher than at those in low-corruption states - a statistically significant difference. "Corruption has been an area that I've been concerned about for quite a long time, and the U.S. is a good avenue for that because there's a lot more data," said Kryzanowski.

`/u/InvictusJoker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kw0myu/there_may_be_a_link_between_political_corruption/):

> The biggest thing I've noticed is that a lot of the general public is unaware to this so it carries on as the normal. When the people aren't aware these companies can just hide behind a series of legal documents and financial buzzwords to justify their actions.

## Scientists have identified a molecule – microRNA-146a – that immune cells in the lungs produce during mechanical ventilation to try to decrease inflammation. The team is working on boosting that natural process in pursuit of a therapy that could lower chances for lung damage in patients on vents.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/protecting-lungs-from-ventilator-induced-injury/):

> In a new study, scientists identified a molecule that is produced by immune cells during mechanical ventilation to try to decrease inflammation, but isn't able to completely prevent ventilator-induced injury to the lungs. The researchers found that immune cells in the lungs called alveolar macrophages - whose job is to protect the lungs from infection - activate miR-146a when they're exposed to pressure that mimics mechanical ventilation. The lungs of genetically modified mice that lacked the microRNA were more heavily damaged by ventilation than lungs in normal mice - pointing to miR-146a's protective role in lungs during mechanical breathing assistance.

`/u/challengemaster` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kvz347/scientists_have_identified_a_molecule/):

> Oh this is interesting, especially for Mesenchymal Stem Cell therapy. MSCs are known to increase miR146a significantly, and also IV injection of MSCs leads to them all getting trapped within the lungs within the first few hours, where they interact with the tissue resident & circulating immune cells.

## Cats may help increase empathy while reducing symptoms of separation anxiety in children with autism. “Some children with autism may have sensory issues or be sensitive to loud noises, so a cat may be an appropriate, comforting pet for some families due to their calming presence.”

## Physicists have accidentally observed quantum oscillation in an insulator -- quantum behavior that was thought to be unique to metals. The finding suggests a brand new type of quantum particle, which the team calls a neutral fermion & challenges a long-held distinction between metals & insulators.

> A large enough voltage will cause anything to conduct.  Not sure I follow the logic here.  Wouldn't it be possible to observe quantum oscillations in an isulator with a voltage high enough for current flow?  Have we looked?  I'm surprised they didn't name them Dark Fermions.

## An international group of astronomists has discovered an extra-galactic “Old Faithful” – an eruption of light flashing about once every 114 days on a nearly predictable schedule. The researchers think it is a tidal disruption event, a phenomenon that happens when a star gets close to a black hole.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/old-faithful-cosmic-eruption-shows-black-hole-ripping-at-star):

> The researchers believe it is a tidal disruption event, a phenomenon that happens when a star gets so close to a black hole that the black hole "Rips" away pieces of the star, causing the flare. As the star approaches the black hole each time, the black hole pulls a little bit of the star away, accreting that part into the black hole. Scientists say the black hole that is causing the flares is very large - about 20 times the size of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way.

> Is "astronomist" the gender neutral version of astronomer? My neighbor (a woman) is an astronomer. I'll have to ask her if she has ever felt oppressed by the title?
