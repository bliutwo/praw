## Study of support for anti-abortion legislation: Evangelical Christians were over four times as likely as others to oppose single, versus married, women’s access to abortion after rape. The most consistent predictors of abortion opposition were right-wing authoritarianism and being male.

Summary of [original article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03623319.2021.1949546):

> The study is an examination of the factors that influence support for Alabama's anti-abortion House Bill 314 under three different scenarios of traumatic abortion, depicting the bill's ramifications: a married woman who is raped and denied an abortion, a single woman who is raped and denied an abortion, and a pregnant, unmarried woman allowed an abortion for health reasons. The most consistent predictors of abortion opposition were right-wing authoritarianism and being male. Participants responded differently depending on whether trauma was the cause of or the reason for the abortion: abortion opposition was lower for abortion with traumatic reason, with authoritarians most likely to oppose abortion access in that scenario.

> Quelle surprise. It’s kind of nice when a study confirms what we all knew though.

## Metabolism peaks at age one and tanks after 60, study finds. The study, of 6,400 people, from eight days old up to age 95, in 29 countries, suggests the metabolism remains "rock solid" throughout mid-life. It peaks at the age of one, is stable from 20 to 60 and then inexorably declines.

> The study, of 6,400 people, from eight days old up to age 95, in 29 countries, suggests the metabolism remains "Rock solid" throughout mid-life. No change at all between the ages of 20 and 60.a permanent decline, with yearly falls that, by 90, leave metabolism 26% lower than in mid-life. There is even discussion about whether drugs that modify the metabolism could slow diseases of old age.

> From looking at the actual journal article, “tank” is a gross overstatement. Metabolism appears to decline after age 60, but at -0.7 +/- 1% per year, so error bars larger than estimated drop. The change between 1 and 20 is -2.8 +/- 0.1% per year, for comparison.

## New research has found heightened levels of sexual satisfaction among BDSM practitioners

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/08/new-research-has-found-heightened-levels-of-sexual-satisfaction-among-practitioners-61671?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook):

> Interest in BDSM appears to be relatively common in the Norwegian population, which suggests "It can be considered to constitute 'normal' sexuality," according to new findings published in The Journal of Sex Research. "We also found that BDSM interests and behaviors were more common among younger populations, but there were no gender or educational level differences. These findings could indicate a general mainstreaming of BDSM.". "We found that participants who had engaged in BDSM behaviors reported significantly higher sexual satisfaction but those who wanted to try role-play but had not yet done so reported lower relationship closeness and sexual satisfaction," Strizzi said.

## 44.01 secures $5M to turn billions of tons of carbon dioxide to stone. Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is an important goal. One promising approach turns the gas into an ordinary mineral through entirely natural processes.

> Techniques like these are going to be mandatory if we hope to crawl out of this environmental catastrophe we seem intent on creating. Reducing emissions is nice, but the real "T-34 moment", if you will, of this war will be when a company finds a way to scrub various greenhouses gases from the atmosphere at scale. Once that happens I sincerely hope world governments fund the effort, because there's very little evidence that human society is capable of preventing the creation and addition of more emissions.

## Belief in social Darwinism linked to dysfunctional psychological characteristics. Results are in line with the idea that social Darwinists hold beliefs that conflict with the principles of liberal democracy, and their vision of social life is not conducive to fostering a cooperative society.

`/u/hellscape_goat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/p38ybn/belief_in_social_darwinism_linked_to/):

> Social Darwinism, which was not an idea of Charles Darwin himself, purports that those who are prosperous are inherently superior to those who are not. It's the ultimate "blame the victim" worldview. The strong have a moral imperative to devour the weak; the rich have the moral imperative to profit regardless of the cost to others or to the society. Not only is Social Darwinism in conflict with liberal democracy, it would naturally be associated with dysfunctional psychological characteristics. I would expect an especially strong association with sociopathy.
