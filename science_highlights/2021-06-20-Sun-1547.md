## Large landlords file evictions at two to three times the rates of small landlords (this disparity is not driven by the characteristics of the tenants they rent to). For small landlords, organizational informality and personal relationships with tenants make eviction a morally fraught decision.

> Attorney here - I used to do pro bono work on behalf of indigent tenants against their landlords. 
> 
> A key consideration that seems to go unmentioned in the abstract (the article is behind a paywall), is the rise of a "cash for keys" culture among small-time landlords.
> 
> Large, corporate landlords have attorneys on retainer to help with evictions, as well as corporate staff to handle the matter and professional maintenance teams to take care of damaged property. They also have economies of scale that let them weather a few nonpaying tenants.
> 
> On the other hand, many large cities (like Boston), have incredibly strong tenant protections that make the eviction process fraught with risk for small-time landlords. The process can take months, small paperwork mistakes can extend this further, and angry tenants can damage the property. A small time landlord simply doesn't have the resources to deal with this.
> 
> So "cash for keys" has become a sort of unofficial standard option - the landlord gives you $500 (or some amount) in cash, and you give him the key and leave immediately. No eviction, no court, no record of eviction for the tenant - but also no huge risk for the small landlord. 
> 
> These cash for keys events would clearly skew the result of this paper, as they are functionally evictions, even if they're not showing up in the record.

## Researchers developed a new technique that keeps quantum bits of light stable at room temperature instead of only working at -270 degrees. In addition, they store these qubits at room temperature for a hundred times longer than ever shown before. This is a breakthrough in quantum research.

Summary of [original article](https://news.ku.dk/all_news/2021/06/new-invention-keeps-qubits-of-light-stable-at-room-temperature/):

> In a recently published study, researchers from University of Copenhagen, demonstrate a new way to store these qubits at room temperature for a hundred times longer than ever shown before. "We have developed a special coating for our memory chips that helps the quantum bits of light to be identical and stable while being in room temperature. In addition, our new method enables us to store the qubits for a much longer time, which is milliseconds instead of microseconds - something that has not been possible before. We are really excited about it," says Eugene Simon Polzik, professor in quantum optics at the Niels Bohr Institute. In contrast, stationary qubits such as superconducting qubits and ionic qubits are well suited for quantum computing.

## 17-Year-Old Student Helped Discover A New Planet On The Third Day Of Internship At NASA

Summary of [original article](https://www.bringside.me/2021/04/17-year-old-student-helped-discover-new.html):

> On January 7, NASA announced the discovery of a new planet TOI 1338b, which is 1300 light-years from Earth and orbits two stars at once. NASA has the TESS Planet Huners project, which allows volunteers to help scientists discover new planets. Cooker himself, in a conversation with reporters, compared his find with Star Wars: "I helped discover a planet that revolves around two stars. One of them is 10% larger than the sun. Look, you can draw an analogy to the homeworld of Luke [Skywalker] Tatooine - that is, during each sunset, two stars will appear."

> pretty cool, they probably give them the tools and point them in the right direction while giving them datasets that are likely to contain some positives. That is why their interns are always discovering planets. Sending them back to school with some accomplishment and validation.

## Study found a privately insured families paid an average of $3,000 out-of-pocket for maternal and newborn hospitalizations but for 1 in 6 families, out-of-pocket spending exceeded $5,000. And when neonatal intensive care was required, the price climbed to over $10,000 for about 1 in 11 families.

> I was a professor at a state college in NY with health insurance covering my family, my wife had additional health insurance coverage at her job at a rich private university.
> 
> When our daughter was born we knew there would be issues, but the main one was that the hospital where she was supposed to be born couldn't handle it and transferred us (as an emergency where we had no choice) to another hospital we later found out was 'out of network". My daughter had a 28 day stay in a Neo-natal intensive care unit.
> 
> This is how two people with what we thought of as  great health insurance ended up with $100,000+ in medical bills from the birth of a child.

## Amphibious fish get smart â€” by working out on land. Experiments on amphibious fish have shown that those that dwell in both air and water become smarter than those that reside only in water. Fish that exercise on land experience a similar brain boost.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01593-9):

> Experiments on amphibious fish have shown that those that dwell in both air and water become smarter than those that reside only in water. The trained jumpers and fish that had been exposed to air navigated a maze and found the meal at the end more quickly, and covered a shorter distance to do so, than did control fish. The authors say the work is a step towards showing how ancient fish evolved and adapted while making the move from water onto land.

## Sex robots are a critically important tool to support sexuality for elderly persons. While often depicted as a product designed for younger people, this paper is a bid for reimagining sex robots as a product to support older adults with disabilities.
