## Scientists have come up with an experimental process that might be able to turn carbon dioxide—a greenhouse gas emitted by all gas-burning engines—into jet fuel. If successful, the process, which uses an iron-based chemical reaction, could result in “net zero” emissions from airplanes.

## A new population of blue whales was discovered hiding in the Indian Ocean; the whales in the group seem to sing a unique song. It joins only a dozen or so other blue whale songs that have been documented. The find is a great reminder that our oceans are still this very unexplored place.

## Energy-drink consumption is associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis in Korean adolescents

Summary of [original article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-00812-2):

> The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the association between energy drinks and various allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, in a large representative Korean adolescent population. 03-1.64, P = 0.025), asthma within the last 12 months, allergic rhinitis within the last 12 months, and atopic dermatitis within the last 12 months compared to no energy-drink consumption in the full-adjusted model. Frequent energy-drink consumption is associated with allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, in Korean adolescents.

## Pandemic drove many people into nature for the first time in years. As COVID-19 health protocols were introduced, nearly 70% of park users increased their visits to local nature. An overwhelming number of respondents -- 81% -- reported an increased importance for these areas, and access to them

Summary of [original article](https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/news/new-nature-lover-its-covid-19-side-effect):

> The research is published today by PLOS ONE. "Like many people, we noticed a large increase in the number of visitors to urban forests and parks in the early days of the pandemic," said the study's senior author Brendan Fisher, director of UVM's Environmental Program and its natural areas. For the study, researchers surveyed visitors to 25 parks and natural areas around greater Burlington, Vermont, an area of roughly 214,000 residents, or roughly a third of the state's population. "Access to urban natural areas may be delivering mental health benefits during a time when they are most needed," said Fisher, a researcher in UVM's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources and the Gund Institute for Environment.

## Study suggests the link between eyelash length and attractiveness has both an evolutionary and cultural basis. The most attractive eyelash length is about one-third of the width of the eye. Eyelashes that are too long can also signal disease, such as immunodeficiency.

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2020/12/study-suggests-the-link-between-eyelash-length-and-attractiveness-has-both-an-evolutionary-and-cultural-basis-58909):

> An experiment published in Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences suggests that the most attractive eyelash length is about one-third of the width of the eye. From an evolutionary perspective, the ideal eyelash length to signal healthiness and attractiveness should be somewhere in between long and short. The results showed that the link between eyelash length and attractiveness followed an inverted U-function, with "The highest ratings peaking at approximately one third of the eyes' width." In other words, both faces with very long eyelashes and those with very short eyelashes were rated as less attractive.
