## Americans' love for individual billionaires affects their views on economic inequality -- and makes them less likely to support wealth taxes on the super-rich, a new study finds.

Summary of [original article](https://news.osu.edu/people-love-the-billionaire-but-hate-the-billionaires-club/):

> The cover was edited to remove five billionaires that most people were familiar with, such as Gates and Winfrey, in order to eliminate any positive or negative biases people might have toward them. People who saw the seven billionaires pictured together were more in favor of an inheritance tax to close the gap between the wealthy and poor than were those who saw only one billionaire. "How we think of the wealthiest people - as a group or as individuals - seems to affect even our policy preferences," he said.

> "I don't know that guy, but man do I love him!" Is a funny way to be.

## Romantic partners who watch pornography together report higher relationship quality, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/10/romantic-partners-who-watch-together-report-higher-relationship-quality-61975?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook):

> Partners who frequently watched pornography together tended to have higher relationship and sexual satisfaction compared to partners who did not. Partners who frequently used pornography alone tended to have reduced relationship and sexual satisfaction when their partner reported a low frequency of pornography use. "Our research suggests that the more a person uses pornography alone, the the worse the quality of their relationship tends to be, but only when their romantic partner rarely or never uses pornography alone."

`/u/Tell_About_Reptoids` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qb155d/romantic_partners_who_watch_pornography_together/):

> Honestly, there's some porn I like that I wouldn't want my partner to know I like because I feel like it misrepresents what I'd like in real life and I wouldn't want to have to explain the complicated reasons why I like it.  
> 
> BUT, if we explored and developed what was our taste when we were watching together, I think that could be really healthy and hot.

## More than 99.9% of studies agree: Humans caused climate change

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/931811):

> ITHACA, N.Y. - More than 99.9% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is mainly caused by humans, according to a new survey of 88,125 climate-related studies. The research updates a similar 2013 paper revealing that 97% of studies published between 1991 and 2012 supported the idea that human activities are altering Earth's climate. In the study, the researchers began by examining a random sample of 3,000 studies from the dataset of 88,125 English-language climate papers published between 2012 and 2020.

> Yeah, but it snowed, so climate change must be a liberal plot

## Air pollution was responsible for 1.1 million deaths across Africa in 2019, with household air pollution accounting for 700,000 fatalities, while increased outdoor air pollution claimed 400,000 lives. Air pollution can also correlated to losses in cognitive development among Africa’s children.

## Canine hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention share similar demographic risk factors and behavioural comorbidities with human ADHD

> Interesting read, although as an ADHD human I find it frankly bizarre that neither Springer or Cocker spaniels were included in this analysis. 
> 
> I presume neither of these breeds are popular in Finland. I'd like to see a follow up study that includes breeds that epitomise the hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention that charactizes ADHD, particularly as these breeds make such excellent working dogs.

> The article is talking about ketamine infusions.  I’ve had this done three times now for chronic pain.  It’s done in the hospital once every several months.  It’s not administered everyday like some of the people here are implying. 
> 
> I’ve seen several studies on this treatment applied to mental disorders. In addition to OCD, it’s been studied in depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder.

## Star's strange path around black hole proves Einstein right – again

Summary of [original article](https://www.science.org/content/article/star-s-strange-path-around-black-hole-proves-einstein-right-again):

> Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity has aced another test. Following nearly 3 decades of monitoring, researchers have detected a subtle shift in the orbit of the closest known star to the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way-and the movement matches Einstein's theory precisely. The star, known as S2, follows an elliptical 16-year orbit.

`/u/Brock_Way` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qb7p8y/stars_strange_path_around_black_hole_proves/):

> Unless dark matter was causing it to precess.
> 
> Because science can theorize any whackadoodle thing and never let go.

## Personality traits and hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found personality can help protect against Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases by delaying or preventing the emergence of neuropathology for those strong in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism.

`/u/Smooth_Imagination` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qajo7b/personality_traits_and_hallmarks_of_alzheimers/):

> Cause or association?
> 
> Lets say that higher brain free radical levels (Reductive / oxidative stress) results in higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness, and secondarily promote neurodegeneration.
> 
> This reminds me of the relation between anxiety and IBS. For a very long time this has been observed and it was thought that the anxiety promoted IBS.
> 
> It turns out in later research that the inflammatory pathways involved in IBS trigger anxiety.
> 
> What is interesting really though is if the above holds true, that if we can reduce the upstream radical related damage and inflammatory signalling then we could get a double win -
> 
> 1 - a population with less neuroticism and higher levels of trait conscientiousness, so a better society, which;
> 
> 2 - has lower rates of Alzheimers.
