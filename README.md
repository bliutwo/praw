# Learning PRAW

Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/cvisv8/how_do_i_get_the_markdown_source_of_a_post/) on getting the Markdown source of a comment (because I wanted to publish an article that quoted a reddit comment), I decided to learn some PRAW. Maybe I can make a useful reddit bot.
