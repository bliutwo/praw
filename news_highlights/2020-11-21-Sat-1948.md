## Apple lobbying against bill aimed at stopping forced labor in China

Summary of [original article](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/nov/20/apple-lobbying-against-bill-aimed-at-stopping-forc/):

> Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said the company "Is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect. We abhor forced labor and support the goals of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. We share the committee's goal of eradicating forced labor and strengthening U.S. law, and we will continue working with them to achieve that." He said the company earlier this year "Conducted a detailed investigation with our suppliers in China and found no evidence of forced labor on Apple production lines, and we are continuing to monitor this closely." Apple's lobbying firm, Fierce Government Relations, disclosed that it was lobbying on the bill on behalf of Apple in a disclosure form that was first reported by the Information. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said publicly that Apple does not tolerate forced labor in its supply chain.

> Remember when just over a year ago, Apple and a bunch of leading businesses made that declaration announcing how shareholder value wasn’t everything. How investing in employees, delivering value to customers, respecting the environment and treating suppliers fairly were going to be core values from now on. Member that?

## In scathing opinion, federal judge dismisses Trump campaign lawsuit in Pennsylvania

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-judge-dismisses-trump-campaign-lawsuit-in-pa/2020/11/21/cc097fbe-2c50-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html):

> A lawsuit brought by President Trump's campaign that sought to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results was dismissed by a federal judge on Saturday evening. Trump's lawsuit in Pennsylvania initially included formal allegations that Boockvar and Democratic-leaning counties also violated the campaign's rights by preventing Republican observers from watching votes being counted, which the defendants denied. The judge said Trump's campaign did not have standing to bring the lawsuit but that even if it had standing it would have failed based on the merits of its case.
