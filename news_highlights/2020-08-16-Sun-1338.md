> Let's just ban the death penalty entirely.

> Edit: for all of the people upvoting me, I would just say that when I mean ban I mean ban. Reddit constantly gets justice boners whenever there's a child molester caught or particularly gruesome murder. The top comment is almost always some call for "justice" in the form of death. That's not justice, that's revenge. One of the points of the law is to separate that understandable desire for primal revenge from true justice. Human rights are human rights. You don't lose them just because you're a terrible human being. Remember that when you see one of those threads.

Phillips, a member of Phi Beta Phi, was initially anxious about the reports of the virus on campus. Friday's news about the clusters was the last straw.

## Major US airlines to lay off thousands of workers as Covid-19 support expires

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/14/us-airlines-layoffs-covid-19-support-delta-united-american):

> Major US airlines have warned they will lay off tens of thousands of workers in October when the Cares Act payroll support program for the industry expires, raising the prospect of devastation for many workers and their families. United Airlines said in early July 2020 it could lay off 36,000 employees, about half its workforce in the US. Nearly 30% of employees, about 17,000, at Southwest have taken voluntary retirement or extended leave as the airline tries to avoid layoffs and furloughs. Smaller US airlines are expected to roll out layoffs in October, including Hawaiian Airlines which announced the airline, currently employing over 7,000 workers, is likely to be 15% to 25% smaller by next summer.

## Forty percent of U.S. Covid-19 tests come back too late to be clinically meaningful, data show

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/15/forty-percent-of-us-covid-19-tests-come-back-too-late-to-be-clinically-meaningful-data-show.html):

> Jha said the variation is evidence of a fragmented testing strategy in the U.S. "It would take a national testing strategy to make sure that, if there's excess capacity in Massachusetts, but long lines in Florida, that Massachusetts could help Florida out," Jha said. "In general, if you do need a test - you fall in the categories of needing a test, even for public health tracing - you're going to get that result within 48 to 36 hours," he said. Not everyone needs tests, Giroir said, and the national testing approach is "Strategic testing, not shotgun testing," which he said has reversed the outbreaks in that region.

> 
> But they let them move in right after they are tested.

> CLEVELAND, Ohio - A correspondent for InfoWars, the far-right website that peddles debunked conspiracy theories and fringe political commentary, was arrested on Friday at a house in Portage County after a grand jury handed up a secret indictment charging her with robbery and domestic violence, according to officials. Portage County Jail staff on Saturday confirmed that Millicent "Millie" Weaver, 29, is being held on charges of robbery, tampering with evidence, obstructing justice and domestic violence. Jones dedicated his Friday show to discussing Weaver's arrest, claiming, without providing any evidence, that she was arrested for stealing government documents.
