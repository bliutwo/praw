## Post-COVID lungs worse than the worst smokers' lungs, surgeon says

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-lungs-worse-smokers-lungs/):

> Dr. Brittany Bankhead-Kendall tweeted, "Post-COVID lungs look worse than any type of terrible smoker's lung we've ever seen. And they collapse. And they clot off. And the shortness of breath lingers on... & on... & on." In X-ray photos of a normal lung, a smoker's lung and a COVID-19 lung that Bankhead-Kendall shared with CBS Dallas, the healthy lungs are clean with a lot of black, which is mainly air. In the smoker's lung, white lines are indicative of scarring and congestion, while the COVID lung is filled with white.

> I had covid all throughout december. 3 weeks of coughing, being out of breathe standing up and walking to the bathroom, horrible body aches and muscle fatigue, fever and decreased appetite. I lost almost 15 lbs. 
> 
> I work a very physical trade job which is heavily reliant in my ability to breathe. I work underwater. Today was my first dive in 2 months. Coming out of the water after 2 hours my chest felt like I'd been hit with a bat. 
> 
> I'll probably be leaving this job in less than a month because I dont think my body will be able to do it anymore.
> 
> Edit: I'm 25 and was running marathons in november, now I cant walk at a brisk pace without struggling.

## Wisconsin pharmacist accused of spoiling Covid-19 vaccine has license suspended

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wisconsin-pharmacist-accused-spoiling-covid-19-vaccine-has-license-suspended-n1254295):

> MILWAUKEE - A state board on Wednesday suspended the license of a Wisconsin pharmacist accused of ruining more than 500 doses of Covid-19 vaccine because he thought it was unsafe. A detective wrote in a probable cause statement that Brandenburg, 46, is an admitted conspiracy theorist and that he told investigators he intentionally tried to ruin the vaccine because it could hurt people by changing their DNA.Misinformation around the Covid-19 vaccines has surged online with false claims circulating on the vaccines' ingredients and possible side effects. One of the earliest false claims suggested that the vaccines could alter DNA. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine rely on messenger RNA or mRNA, which is a fairly new technology used in vaccines that experts have been working on for years.

> Who the hell gave him a license in the first place?? Every pharmacist should know mRNA doesn’t alter DNA under typical circumstances

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/biden-inauguration-delta-ceo-says-travelers-wont-be-allowed-to-check-firearms-into-dc.html):

> Delta Air Lines won't allow travelers flying to the airports serving the Washington metropolitan area to check firearms on flights ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC on Thursday.

Several airports said they will add more police, while airlines are increasing staffing and booking overnighting crews at airport hotels.
