## Dollar Tree, Family Dollar to require masks for customers, associates

Summary of [original article](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/dollar-tree-family-dollar-to-require-masks-for-customers-associates/):

> DETROIT, Mich. - Last week, a Delta Airlines flight was forced to return to the gate in Detroit when two of their customers wouldn't wear masks. In a statement provided to NPR, Delta wrote: "Medical research tells us that wearing a mask is one of the most effective ways to reduce the COVID-19 infection rate." The airline "Remains committed to requiring customers and employees to wear a mask or face covering as a consistent layer of protection across all Delta touchpoints." As for exceptions to the mask rule, Delta's procedure involves a "Virtual consultation process facilitated by a Delta agent with a third-party medical professional [and] could take up to an hour." The airline generally encourages customers with underlying conditions that preclude mask-wearing to "Reconsider travel altogether."

> The Dollar General near me started 'requiring' them a few weeks ago. Not only do the staff not really wear the masks themselves (most of the time they are hanging around the neck) they don't do crap to enforce it on the customers either. Now my state has a mask order and its not being enforced at any place I've been since.

## Portland protests continue for 74th day Sunday, following violent confrontations Saturday night

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/08/portland-protests-continue-for-74th-day-sunday-following-violent-confrontations-saturday-night.html):

> A crowd of around 200 that marched on a police union building in North Portland on Sunday evening was quickly pushed back and scattered by police in the city's 74th night of protests. Saturday's standoff, which lasted into early morning hours Sunday, prompted police to declare a riot and advance on the crowd using impact munitions and physical force, a pattern that's unfolded on several recent nights in which a small group provoke police by damaging property and throwing objects at officers. Late the night before, a small group of demonstrators lit a fire inside the Portland police union building, sparking the riot declaration from police, who ordered everyone to leave the area.

> I am guilty of regularly posting Portland stories (I guess because I live here and read the Oregonian). But, I think we are at the point where the real big news story will be a day when there *aren’t* protests here.
