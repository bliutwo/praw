## Alexei Navalny releases investigation into Vladimir Putin’s wealth

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2021/jan/22/alexei-navalny-releases-investigation-into-vladimir-putins-wealth-video):

> Alexei Navalny's team has released a mammoth investigation into Vladimir Putin's wealth, including a £1bn palace on the Black Sea allegedly built for the Russian president that the opposition leader called 'the biggest bribe in history'. Navalny, 44, returned to Russia on Sunday from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with the novichok nerve agent in an attack he blamed on Russian security services and Putin. The Kremlin has denied the luxury complex belongs to Putin and urged Russians not to send their money to 'crooks'.

> Despite countless studies that have proven that masks limit the spread of COVID-19, store owner Scott Cerkoney says his Teeslangers T-shirt shop has a "Strict no-mask policy." In the initial police report, MCSO referred to the lack of mask compliance to the Arizona Department of Health Services for enforcement. "ADHS' enforcement authority over mask requirements covers restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, and water parks as per the governor's executive order. Mask use is required in those businesses statewide...Maricopa County is responsible for the scope and enforcement of its mask mandate when it comes to other venues," the ADHS spokesperson said.

> For the younger & non-baseball or non-American friends:
> 
> Hank was an icon to put it simply. The all-time home run record is probably the most distinguished record in American sports & when Hank Aaron broke that record it was a *HUGE* deal. 
> 
> He got death threats. Put up with racism & bigotry daily. Yet he persisted & over 20+ years, kept quietly doing his thing & amassing impressive stats. He was the definition of consistency. 
> 
> [Here is the clip](https://youtu.be/QjqYThEVoSQ) of him breaking the record. The call was by Vin Scully, another baseball icon who started calling games for the Dodgers way back in 1950 & retired in 2016. 
> 
> If you’re unfamiliar with all this stuff, pay attention to Scully in that clip. It is considered one of the best moments in sports broadcasting as well as in American sports. He had an unmatched skill for understanding & portraying the gravity of a moment.

## One hull crack located in ISS, another one suspected

Summary of [original article](https://tass.com/science/1247847):

> The specialists have discovered one more crack at the International Space Station and suspect that yet another one exists, ISS Russian Segment head Vladimir Solovyov told Rossiya-24. On October 15, the ISS crew reported that the possible leak location was located; according to cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, the crack appeared like a jagged scratch about 2-3 cm in length. In November, Russian cosmonauts photographed the suspected leak location on the outside of the ISS, but found no hull damage at where the crack is supposed to be.

`/u/dogmadisk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l2ml1r/one_hull_crack_located_in_iss_another_one/):

> "This leak is like as if you’d drill the hull with a 0.2 mm diameter drill. I’m not sure such drills even exist in household. As for the leak it causes, our [space air] pressure is 750 mmHg, and this alleged crack causes us to lose 0.3 to 0.4 mmHg every day," the official said, adding that emergency leak starts when pressure falls at 0.5 to 1 mmHg per minute.

Some educators have continued to teach through recorded videos or Facebook Live.It was unclear if the district would punish teachers who failed to show up next week.
