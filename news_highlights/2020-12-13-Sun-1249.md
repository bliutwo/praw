## Navalny poisoning: Russia made second assassination attempt — report

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/navalny-poisoning-russia-made-second-assassination-attempt-report/a-55921189):

> The Kremlin tried to poison outspoken Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny a second time after the first attempt failed, The Times newspaper has alleged. A second dose of poison was allegedly given to Navalny before he was flown to Berlin for further treatment, western intelligence sources told the British newspaper on Saturday. The Times alleged that Russian security forces may have influenced the doctor who treated Navalny in Omsk - he would later announce that Putin's greatest critic was probably suffering from a metabolic disorder rather than poisoning.

> Just a reminder for Republicans that Democrats introduced numerous election security bills last year, ones that would guarantee a paper trail with electronic machines and make audits commonplace when certifying election results.
> 
> Want to guess which party blocked these bills? And do you know what their objection was? Those bills would also force states to provide a set number of voting machines per capita so people wouldn't have to spend 5 hours in line to vote. The madness!

## U.S. Treasury breached by hackers backed by foreign government - sources

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKBN28N0PG):

> 2 Min Read.WASHINGTON - Hackers backed by a foreign government have been monitoring internal email traffic at the U.S. Treasury Department and an agency that decides internet and telecommunications policy, according to people familiar with the matter. There is concern within the U.S. intelligence community that the hackers who targeted the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration used a similar tool to break into other government agencies, according to three people briefed on the matter. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said.

`/u/pain_in_your_ass` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/kcgv2g/us_treasury_breached_by_hackers_backed_by_foreign/):

> > The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter.
> 
> Hope Biden is briefed, and that nobody expects trump to do anything, seeing as how he fired the head of CISA and apparently prefers to watch Fox news and tweet conspiracy theories over listening to intelligence briefings.

> SAN DIEGO - California's attorney general has told the owners of two San Diego strip clubs to follow orders because he said they are violating the state's new stay-at-home policy, which bars social gatherings in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. In a letter sent Friday to Midway Ventures LLC and F-12 Entertainment Group, the owners of Pacers Showgirls International and Cheetahs Gentlemen's Club, respectively, Xavier Becerra said the clubs must change their policies because they are in violation of the order, issued Dec. 6, that covers Southern California. The clubs sued the county in October after officials ordered them to close, saying live entertainment was not allowed under the public health order.
