According to Detroit Free Press, the police officers had asked the homeowners to restrain their dog while police conducted a search for a weapon believed to have been tossed into a yard in the area.

`/u/whyintheworldamihere` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/igiesy/police_commissioner_to_launch_investigation_after/):

> That's pretty fucked up. It's the cop's fault for letting her own dog go right up to the fence and stick its nose in. Then the police chief tells people to keep their dogs out of their own fenced in front yards? On their own secured property? Hell no. Hopefully that woman sues for enough money to move out of Detroit.

> MIAMI - Authorities said a Miami police officer's wife died after getting trapped in the backseat of his patrol vehicle for hours in the Florida heat. The Miami Herald reports Clara Paulino got in the back seat of the SUV Friday looking for something and then was trapped for about four hours without anyway of contacting anyone. The Miami Herald reported a partition between the back seat and the front seat likely stopped her from being able to honk the horn, and she didn't have her cell phone with her to call for help.

## ‘Extremely frustrating’ mail delays for prescriptions hit veterans, rural areas | Nevada Current

Summary of [original article](https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2020/08/25/extremely-frustrating-mail-delays-for-prescriptions-hit-veterans-rural-areas/):

> Stowe, a Department of Veterans Affairs patient who receives her medication through the U.S. Postal Service, said in an interview with States Newsroom that she missed four or five days taking her prescription for diazepam, commonly marketed as Valium, because of mail delays. Veterans, people who require specialty medications, rural residents far from pharmacies and others who receive their prescription medications through the Postal Service say they have experienced delays and other delivery disruptions after the Trump administration made changes to post office operations. There is at least anecdotal evidence that patients like Stowe who depend on the mail for prescription medication are seeing delays and it's stressful even for those who've not missed doses.

> Adding insult to injury, a lot of employers/insurance companies force you to get your prescriptions through the mail. Pick it up at your local pharmacy and you'll be paying for it yourself.

## University of Oregon Will Charge Students for a Full Year of Dorm Housing Even if They Can’t Enter the Classroom

Summary of [original article](https://www.wweek.com/news/schools/2020/08/24/university-of-oregon-will-charge-students-for-a-full-year-of-dorm-housing-even-if-they-cant-enter-the-classroom/):

> The University of Oregon's latest notice has deepened concern for students and their families. "If the university closes the residence halls and requires all students to leave campus for the remainder of the school year, students will not be charged for the canceled portion of the room and meal plan," the contract says. OSU made the following statement: "Students who decide to cancel during fall term after moving to campus can complete a cancellation request and will not incur any cancellation fees. Students will be charged only for the days they occupy their room on campus." Even the private Reed College offers more flexibility than UO by allowing students to petition an early cancellation of their housing contracts.

> Hold up, are the kids living in the dorm because they want to be on campus even if classes are online? 
> 
> I ask because about 60% of students at the college my daughter goes to are doing this. She decided to stay home for the fall semester and of course was not asked to pay for the dorm. Many kids want to be on campus even if it’s remote for whatever reason. Of course they have to pay for the dorm.

> Hopefully he finds a good rehabilitation center for his spinal cord injury. I was shot and paralyzed from the chest down (C8 complete spinal cord injury) a few years ago, and Craig Hospital in Denver was indispensable in making me continue to live a full and healthy life doing things I love. It’s an injury that’ll likely keep me in my wheelchair for life, but I’m incredibly lucky that I’m still here to enjoy it!
