## Ghislaine Maxwell: lawyers ask judge to stop accusers from posting evidence online

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/ghislaine-maxwell-lawyers-judge-accusers-internet):

> Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell asked a judge to stop her accusers from using evidence in the criminal case to boost civil lawsuits by posting materials to the internet. The lawyers say attorneys for women who claim Maxwell recruited and abused them should be subject to the same secrecy rules as prosecutors and Maxwell's defense lawyers. Maxwell's lawyers cited current civil litigation between Maxwell and "Many of the government's potential witnesses", saying numerous potential witnesses and their lawyers have already publicly commented about the case.

> I assumed this was about trying to insure they can get an impartial jury when the time for the trial comes (which would be a reasonable request)
> But instead they are requesting it for the civil suits so I'm curious what the prosecutions response is going to be (article says tomorrow they will make one) and how a judge will rule

## Man accused of running over Sikh man charged with hate crime

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/man-accused-running-over-sikh-man-charged-hate-crime-n1234803):

> A man accused of running over the Sikh owner of a suburban Denver liquor store after reportedly telling him and his wife to "Go back to your country" is now facing a hate crime charge in addition to 16 other charges, including attempted murder. Prosecutors said the hate crime charge was filed against Eric Breemen on Tuesday nearly three months after the alleged assault in the parking lot of the Lakewood store Lakhwant Singh owns with his wife, The charges came after an investigation prosecutors say was delayed by the severity of Singh's injuries, his 65-day stay in the hospital and coronavirus pandemic restrictions. According to the Sikh Coalition, a civil rights organization that fights discrimination against Sikhs and represents Singh, Breemen began picking up items in an agitated manner after entering Two Angels Liquors before harassing Singh and his wife, telling them to "Go back to your country," and damaging numerous items in the store.

`/u/Mist_Rising` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hywcpa/man_accused_of_running_over_sikh_man_charged_with/):

> Sikhs have to be the most incorrectly targeted group. Nobody attacks a sihk for being a sihk, they do it for being Muslim. Its like attacking a Hindu for being a Catholic, doesn't make sense. All because Shia Muslims wear turbans, and sihks wear turbans.
