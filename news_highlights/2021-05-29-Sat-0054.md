## In victory for Trump, Republicans blocks probe of US Capitol riot.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-slow-act-probe-into-deadly-capitol-attack-2021-05-28/):

> Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Friday derailed a bipartisan inquiry into the deadly assault on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, despite a torrent of criticism the lawmakers were playing down the violence. Democrats and some moderate Republicans had called for a commission to probe the events up to and including Jan. 6, when hundreds of supporters of Trump, a Republican, stormed the Capitol, fighting with police, urging violence against lawmakers and delaying the formal certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. "We all know what's going on here. Senate Republicans chose to defend the Big Lie because they feared that anything that might upset Donald Trump could hurt them politically," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote.

HOUSTON - Eleven employees with a Texas sheriff's office have been fired and six others suspended following the February death of an inmate who was hit multiple times in the head by detention officers, authorities announced Friday. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said medical examiners had ruled Jaquaree Simmons's death a homicide from injuries to his head. A three-month internal affairs investigation concluded Simmons had two fights with detention officers on Feb. 16 when the jail had lost power and water pressure during the state's deadly winter storm.

## New Texas Law Bans Reality Shows from working with law enforcement After Man Filmed Being Killed By Police

> The reality show in question, PD Live,  destroyed evidence pertaining to the death of Javier Ambler. The law was actually proposed by a democrat to stop law enforcement from amping things up for the camera. The former Williamson County Sheriff is facing criminal charges over his cover up of the crime and he’s been accused of having his deputies spice up mundane patrols for the benefit of reality TV. The fact that Governor Abbot is proclaiming this to be a pro police measure has more to do with Texas statewide politics than why the bill was written.

## Microsoft says SolarWinds hackers have struck again at the US and other countries

Summary of [original article](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/05/28/tech/microsoft-solarwinds-russia-hack-intl-hnk/index.html):

> The hackers behind one of the worst data breaches ever to hit the US government have launched a new global cyberattack on more than 150 government agencies, think tanks and other organizations, according to Microsoft. It believes the hackers are part of the same Russian group behind last year's devastating attack on SolarWinds - a software vendor - that targeted at least nine US federal agencies and 100 companies. By gaining access to USAID's account, the hackers were able to send out phishing emails that Microsoft said "Looked authentic but included a link that, when clicked, inserted a malicious file" that allowed the hackers to access computers through a backdoor.

> So can the internet and cyber security *finally* be considered “infrastructure” now?
