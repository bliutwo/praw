> Sure. Dealing with COVID from March-October of 2020 would have been life changing and horrifying. You're struggling to keep afloat and people keep dying.
> 
> Then even single doctor, public health official and scientist begged, *literally begged* people to avoid groups and travel for the winter, and people were like, "LOL COVID IS A HOAX LIBERALS WANT TO CANCEL CHRISTMAS!!!!", and so the winter was *worse* than April of 2020.
> 
> So you made it through the darkest of months, December, January and February, watching hundreds of people die, even though the vaccines were rolling out, but for far too many, the vaccine didn't come in time.
> 
> And then it did. A miracle happened: vaccines with almost no serious side effects appeared, and the US made a herculean effort to get shots in arms. The army was deployed to massive vaccine clinics, every pharmacy in the country set up a vaccine area.  People broke down in tears when getting vaccinated, as it symbolized a release from lockdowns, isolation and fear. By May the vaccines were available to every man, woman and teenager in the US.
> 
> It looked like the summer of 2021 would rival the roaring 20s- people were emerging from a year and a half of isolation and we're ready to party. We had the supply chain to hit herd immunity by July 4th. By September, we could have vaccinated every single eligible American. 
> 
> But some people decided...nah.
> 
> And now those people are dying in droves. How in the *world* can a doctor or nurse who had been through all that possibly care about these deaths? These people are as reckless, as foolish, as a drunk driver.

## Former Spokane police officer awaiting trial for rape charges arrested again for allegedly raping another woman

Summary of [original article](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/aug/04/spokane-detectives-arrest-former-officer-in-sexual/):

> A fired Spokane Police officer awaiting trial for allegedly sexually assaulting a victim of domestic violence was arrested Wednesday on new charges after another woman reported he raped her while on duty. Nathan Nash, 38, faces charges of second-degree rape and unlawful imprisonment in the new case, the Spokane County Sheriff's Office reported in a news release. Nash's trial for the initial counts of rape and official misconduct was set to begin on Aug. 30, but according to court documents filed last month, the prosecution may ask to postpone the trial to include information about these new allegations.

`/u/reddicyoulous` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/oy5p39/former_spokane_police_officer_awaiting_trial_for/):

> >While Nash was fired in 2019 after the first rape charges were filed against him, that incident was not the first red flag. In 2018, Nash’s handling on a domestic violence incident was called into question when he and two other officers failed to interview a victim after a fight outside of a bar.  
> >  
> >Then in June 2019, Nash reportedly didn’t arrest a domestic violence suspect who was in possession of a significant amount of cocaine and gave the female victim his personal cellphone number.  
> >  
> >After the initial sexual assault allegations were reported publicly, two more women came forward to report inappropriate interactions with Nash.
> 
> The police need to stop blatantly ignoring cops red flags and take civilian complaints more seriously with harsher punishments.

## Facebook has shut down the personal accounts of a pair of New York University researchers and shuttered their investigation into misinformation spread through political ads on the social network.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-5d3021ed9f193bf249c3af158b128d18):

> The NYU researchers with the Ad Observatory Project had for several years been looking into Facebook's Ad Library, where searches can be done on advertisements running across Facebook's products. ADVERTISEMENT.Facebook's action against the NYU project also cut off other researchers and journalists who got access to Facebook data through the project, Edelson said. Facebook sent a cease-and-desist letter to Edelson and another researcher, Damon McCoy, in October but didn't shut down their accounts until Tuesday, hours after Edelson informed the platform that she and McCoy were studying the spread of disinformation on the platform about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the researchers said.
