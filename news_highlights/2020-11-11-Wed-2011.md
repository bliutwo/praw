## On Election Day, Key West voted to ban large cruise ships

Summary of [original article](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/key-west-large-cruise-ship-ban):

> According to The Impacts of the Cruise Ship Industry on the Quality of Life in Key West report, or the Murray Report, traffic and pollutants from the 390 cruise ships that visit the Keys annually cause "Chronic water-quality issues" and kill coral and sea creatures including lobster and conch, threatening the local charter fishing industry too - an industry that supports 8000 jobs in the area. The report lays out the limited economic benefit large cruise ships have on the Keys, arguing that while cruise ship passengers make up 50% of all visitors in Key West, they only contribute to 8% of all visitor spending; spending an average of $32 per passengers, while other tourists spend an average of $550. The residents of Key West don't want an outright ban on cruises. Luxury cruise lines like Regent Seven Seas, Seabourn and Silversea currently meet the new criteria, which could effectively close Key West cruises off to budget spenders.

## It's not just you: YouTube is down

Summary of [original article](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/11/its-not-just-you-youtube-is-down/):

> YouTube appears to be down(ish) for many at the time of writing, with widespread anecdotal reports as well as a spike over at DownDetector. The outage may be affecting other services as well, but combing through more organic reports indicates it's limited to YouTube and related services, seemingly including YouTube TV and potentially YouTube Music. If you're having trouble watching videos on YouTube right now, you're not alone - our team is aware of the issue and working on a fix.

## Evidence suggests several state Senate candidates were plants funded by dark money

Summary of [original article](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/11/11/evidence-suggests-several-state-senate-candidates-were-plants-funded-by-dark-money/):

> Local 10 News has found evidence to suggest three such candidates in three Florida Senate district races, two of them in Miami Dade County, were shill candidates whose presence in the races were meant to syphon votes from Democratic candidates. A search of campaign documents filed by Rodriguez led to a money trail and campaign finance connections with other no-party third candidates in Florida Senate District 9 in Central Florida, and District 39 in Miami-Dade.The District 39 candidate is 81-year-old Celso Alfonso, a retiree who named the woman he calls his wife as campaign treasurer. The end of the money trail leaves no information on who is ultimately funding at least three candidates for Florida Senate who did no campaigning and no fundraising, whose presence in the race might have recalculated the number of voters who cast votes for the Democrats in the race.

`/u/Icolan` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/js85qm/evidence_suggests_several_state_senate_candidates/):

> Ranked Choice voting would make this kind of scheme pointless as the votes for those candidates would end up going to those voters second or third choices in subsequent vote counts, provided one candidate did not win outright.

## U.S. deports migrant women who alleged abuse by Georgia doctor

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-deports-migrant-women-who-alleged-abuse-georgia-doctor-n1247372):

> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already deported six former patients who complained about Dr. Mahendra Amin, who has been accused of operating on migrant women without their consent or performing procedures that were medically unnecessary and potentially endangered their ability to have children. Amin's lawyer, Scott Grubman, has previously denied the doctor did anything wrong and called him a "Highly respected physician who has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia." Amin has stopped seeing women at Irwin County Detention Center. Yanira said Amin told her he would perform a vaginal ultrasound and that she would need a Pap smear, a test for cancer in which a doctor collects cells from a woman's cervix.

> My guess is that they were deported as a deterrent so that the other victims won’t report it. Trump is separating families as an immigration deterrent so this seems logical.
