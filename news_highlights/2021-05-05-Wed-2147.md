## Atlanta police officer who was fired after fatally shooting Rayshard Brooks has been reinstated

Summary of [original article](https://abcn.ws/3xQJoQz):

> Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old husband, father and stepfather, was running away when he was shot by officer Garrett Rolfe on June 12, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said at the time. The first officer to arrive to the scene, Devin Brosnan, knocked on Brooks' window but couldn't wake him up. Rolfe responded to the scene when Brosnan radioed a dispatcher saying he needed a DUI-certified officer.

`/u/Krankjanker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5j6o0/atlanta_police_officer_who_was_fired_after/):

> The city violated it's own ordinance when they fired him. They were clearly aware of that, and chose to do it anyway in what they likely calculated to be a worthwhile decision as they probably thought the reduction in rioting from firing him would save more money than his lawsuit for wrongful termination would cost.

## New law requires Washington schools to provide free menstrual products to students

Summary of [original article](https://www.kxly.com/new-law-requires-washington-schools-to-provide-free-menstrual-products-to-students/):

> Public and private schools in Washington will soon be required to provide free menstrual products to students. The law states that schools must provide menstrual hygiene products in all gender-neutral and female bathrooms by the beginning of the 2022-23 school year. READ: Bill requiring schools to provide free menstrual products heads to Inslee's desk.

`/u/summebrooke` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5hfzc/new_law_requires_washington_schools_to_provide/):

> As a former teenage girl, it was always so sad to see another girl desperately asking around for menstrual products, especially the girls that you knew didn’t have much money in their household. There’s no way to focus on school when you’re panicking about when the blood is going to start seeping through your pants or sitting on a huge wad on toilet paper shoved down your undies and praying that’s enough

## Trump's Facebook ban upheld by Oversight Board

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-s-facebook-ban-upheld-oversight-board-n1266339):

> Facebook was justified in banning then-President Donald Trump from its platform the day after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, but it needs to reassess how long the ban will remain in effect, the social network's quasi-independent Oversight Board said Wednesday. "The Oversight Board is clearly telling Facebook they can't invent new, unwritten rules when it suits them," said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a co-chair of the Oversight Board and a former prime minister of Denmark, on a call with reporters. Facebook created the Oversight Board last year as a kind of "Supreme court" to hear appeals from users like Trump who have had their posts removed or who want to challenge other sensitive or contentious moderation decisions.

`/u/AudibleNod` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5ffvo/trumps_facebook_ban_upheld_by_oversight_board/):

> Here's an [explainer of how the board operates](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-05-05/factbox-what-is-facebooks-oversight-board).
> 
> Basically, Facebook took the 'final' decision out of its own hands and into a committee. There's 20 members (growing to 40) and they have about 90 days to decide if a ban is upheld or can be lifted. On the committee are a Nobel Laureate, several judges and civil rights advocates. They serve 3 year terms for up to nine years.

`/u/TexasYankee212` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5ql2f/ap_trooper_charged_in_child_rape_hid_checkered/):

> If we had a national law enforcement license database, we could keep track of law enforcement people who really should not be law enforcement people.  After what he did at the FBI, his law enforcement credentials should have been revoked and he should not have been allowed to get a job with the Alabama State Police.  Both the FBI and the Alabama State PD should be held accountable for allowing a child rapist to just "move on" to another law enforcement job.
> 
> I read that the Alabama people are running for cover on this one for their supposed "vetting" of this guy.
