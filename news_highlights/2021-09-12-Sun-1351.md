## Top security officials to reinstall Capitol fence ahead of far-right rally

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/12/capitol-fence-congress-january-attack):

> Top security officials in Congress are expected to reinstall fencing around the Capitol and authorize the use of deadly force ahead of a planned rally by far-right Trump supporters next weekend demanding the release of rioters arrested in connection with the 6 January insurrection. The reinstallation of the 7ft fence as part of a perimeter that could extend to the Capitol reflecting pool will be supplemented by the authorization of US Capitol police officers to use deadly force to protect members of Congress and staff, the sources said. The approval for the fence is almost certain to be granted as security officials believe it remains the most efficient method to secure the Capitol - and can serve as a dry-run for a new quick-reaction fencing contract funded in a $2.1bn security bill passed by Congress in July.Members of the US Capitol police board weighed whether to request the national guard but the threat assessment for the 18 September rally reviewed at a series of meetings in recent days did not warrant the backstop, the sources said.

## Couple Kicked off San Diego-Bound JetBlue Over Face-Mask Dispute

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/couple-kicked-off-san-diego-bound-plane-over-face-mask-dispute-jetblue/2714839/):

> An irate man and his wife who did not adhere to wearing face masks properly were kicked off a flight from Fort Lauderdale to San Diego after yelling at flight attendants before takeoff, JetBlue said. "If a customer refuses to wear a face mask after being asked, crewmembers will work to de-escalate the situation to the best of their ability to gain compliance prior to removal. The safety of each customer and crewmember is our first priority, and we must work together to follow the federal mask mandate during the travel journey." A man became irate while on a plane headed to San Diego and yelled expletives at the airline crew after he and his wife were asked to wear their face masks correctly.

> I heard about this on NPR just the other day. The person being interviewed had been in contact with the man’s widow and was asked how she felt about America after having her husband so tragically and senselessly murdered. The widow just talked about the thousands of Americans - Jewish, Muslim, Christian - who showed up to his funeral to mourn with her. Would be easy to feel hate after something like that but she chose to recognize the love.

## Six Capitol Police officers face discipline for actions during Jan. 6 riot

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/six-capitol-police-officers-face-discipline-actions-during-jan-6-n1278993):

> A U.S. Capitol Police investigation into the conduct of officers during the Jan. 6 riot did not find any criminal behavior, but six officers were recommended for discipline for breaking rules, officials said Saturday. An internal watchdog report obtained by NBC News in April found that Capitol Police ignored critical intelligence that right-wing protesters planned to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop the presidential election results from being certified. Seven Capitol Police officers attacked on Jan. 6 sued former President Donald Trump, his allies and members of far-right extremist groups last month in federal court, accusing them of sending a violent mob to the Capitol to keep Trump in power.

> The people in charge of the officers need to face the music as well. I find it hard to believe that no one knew a huge crowd was coming. It was online for weeks and Trump even invited people to it personally. The officers should be disciplined but their bosses should too. And their bosses bosses.
