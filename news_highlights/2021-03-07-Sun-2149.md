## Another ex-aide calls Cuomo's office conduct inappropriate

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/new-york-andrew-cuomo-58b44c3e15d120151f936c7e928ec095):

> Ana Liss, 35, told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Saturday that when she worked as a policy aide to the governor between 2013 and 2015, Cuomo called her "Sweetheart," once kissed her hand and asked personal questions, including whether she had a boyfriend. Cuomo's workplace conduct has been under intense scrutiny in recent days as several women have publicly told of feeling sexually harassed, or at least made to feel demeaned and uncomfortable by the Democrat. Another woman, who did not work for the state, described Cuomo putting his hands on her face and asking if he could kiss her after they met at a wedding.

`/u/trashboat____` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lzqv1i/another_exaide_calls_cuomos_office_conduct/):

> >“I understand sensitivities have changed. Behavior has changed,” Cuomo said. “I get it and I’m going to learn from it.”
> 
> Women have always hated being kissed and touched by their employers. They hated it when his father did it. The only thing that's changed is people call it out now. It's been decades of women fighting this kind of behavior and this jackass has the stones to say this is all brand new information for him and he's suddenly going to learn from it. Fuck Cuomo.

## FAA safety engineer goes public to slam the agency’s oversight of Boeing’s 737 MAX

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/faa-safety-engineer-goes-public-to-slam-the-agencys-oversight-of-boeings-737-max/):

> Haunted by the two deadly crashes of Boeing 737 MAX jets and his agency's role in approving the plane, veteran Federal Aviation Administration safety engineer Joe Jacobsen is stepping forward publicly to give the victims' families "a firsthand account of what the truth is." Jacobsen, the local FAA office's most experienced engineer in aircraft handling and performance, would have been deeply involved in assessing MCAS had Boeing properly identified it to the FAA as a new and critical system. Since the FAA acknowledges that the 737 MAX "Is stable both with and without MCAS operating," Jacobsen thinks it should grant an exemption to the certification requirements that make MCAS necessary.

`/u/knighttimeblues` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lzwb8r/faa_safety_engineer_goes_public_to_slam_the/):

> That he needs to do this is deeply troubling. I don’t want to fly on the 737 MAX until this problem is truly fixed.
