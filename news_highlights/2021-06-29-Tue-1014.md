## South African court orders ex-president to jail for contempt.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-africa-south-africa-courts-ca4b08b93ab679ec2304da47625800bd?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP):

> South Africa's apex court, the Constitutional Court, ruled that Zuma defied an order by the country's highest court by refusing to cooperate with the commission of inquiry, which is chaired by deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo. "The Constitutional Court holds that there can be no doubt that Mr. Zuma is in contempt of court. Mr. Zuma was served with the order and it is impossible to conclude anything other than that he was unequivocally aware of what it required of him," said acting chief justice Sisi Khampepe. Zuma has previously expressed his unwillingness to appear before the commission, which has so far heard evidence directly implicating Zuma in wrongdoing.
