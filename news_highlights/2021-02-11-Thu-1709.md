## In a new court hearing, Britney Spears' father loses bid to retain complete control of his daughter's financial investments

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/britney-spears-father-loses-bid-retain-control-delegating-her-investments-n1257502):

> Britney Spears filed a petition with the court last year to remove her father and to place a financial institution as the sole conservator over her estate. The pop star's legal struggle is under new scrutiny following the New York Times' release of "Framing Britney," a documentary that followed Britney Spears' rise to stardom and the media pressure that's often blamed for her public breakdown in 2007.James Spears has been her legal conservator for 12 years. Sam Asghari, who has been dating Britney Spears since 2016, criticized his girlfriend's father in an Instagram Story on Wednesday and said he had "Zero respect" for the man.

> For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, the New York Times' new #FreeBritney documentary is up now on [Hulu] (https://www.hulu.com/series/the-new-york-times-presents-f22278d1-ef56-40e8-9227-af3a029ca6f4). It does an excellent, thorough job explaining this whole messed up situation. The creators even did an AMA on Reddit the other day. Today's news is a small but positive step for Britney's freedom (as a 39 year old woman fighting for access to the millions of dollars she's earned since working as a child). Her gold-digging dad Jamie is still **a** conservator but now he will share that power with an impartial bank that Britney and her lawyer requested. She is still fighting to have her father removed as conservator at all and is currently on a work hiatus - refusing to work until her dad is not in charge of her life anymore.

> Here’s the additional issue this causes. 
> 
> If you don’t believe consent is an important concept, and that sex should only happen between people who are married to each other, then you’re assuming any sex between a married couple is consensual. 
> 
> 1) A person does not automatically consent just because you’re married. 
> 2) A person does not automatically consent just because they’ve consented before. 
> 3) A person can withdraw consent at any time before or during.
> 
> All of these lessons are important and can be taught to people who believe in not having sex before marriage. None of this conflicts with that.

> So this company has a policy of flat colored masks with no designs, she openly states she broke the policy for her own self virtue, and then blamed the store for not having a BLM sign.

> She isn't fired, she just walked out, and now this company is under attack.

> Damned if you do and damned if you don't.

> The restaurant doesn't deserve this, there are major companies using literal slave labor and this is what activism is used on. What a joke.

## Judge declines new arrest warrant for Kyle Rittenhouse

Summary of [original article](https://whdh.com/news/judge-declines-new-arrest-warrant-for-kyle-rittenhouse/):

> Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder also rejected prosecutors' request for a $200,000 bail increase for Kyle Rittenhouse, who came to Kenosha in August as hundreds were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said in court filings that prosecutors realized Rittenhouse was no longer living at his apartment in Antioch, Illinois, when a court notice was returned as undeliverable. Rittenhouse's attorneys argued that threats have forced Rittenhouse into hiding.

> Reminder that among all the times that these assholes have gone out of their way to ruin random innocent peoples lives, they attempted to poison the investigation of credibly-accused child rapist and Republican senate candidate Roy Moore by planting an Veritas employee as a supposed victim and then exposing how her story would not add up 
> 
> James O'Keefe should have gone to prison, and he should continue to be in prison. Him being banned from Twitter is not 'cancel culture', it is evidence that cancel culture does not actually exist in any meaningful fashion. He should be doing hard labor for his crimes and never get to see the light of day again

> Some Robinhood traders who can't get in touch with customer service are trying another tactic: showing up at its front door. After failed attempts to contact Robinhood's customer service, he decided to drive more than 2,400 miles from his home in Sellersburg, Indiana last Thursday to Robinhood's headquarters to close down his account. CNBC witnessed another Robinhood client kicking and knocking on the front door of Robinhood, claiming the start-up had "$2 million of my money on hold," and asking to "Take my account number down."
