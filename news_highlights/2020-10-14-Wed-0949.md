> Crossing the border illegally is technically a misdemeanor. Imagine being confined for months and having a non consensual surgery to prevent you from reproducing because you got drunk in public or shoplifted  something under $500.

> This shows the gross pettiness of the Chinese regime and its insecure self image as a base entity without regard for the historical foundation of its own cultural integrity.  The smart play would be to integrate all of these sources of cultures into its own tapestry rather than delete anything that isn’t a red book waving drone.

## Amy Cooper Made 2nd 911 Call to Falsely Accuse Black Bird-Watcher

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/nyregion/amy-cooper-false-report-charge.html#click=https://t.co/FiWaf2NoLv):

> In a second call to 911, which was not shown in the video of the confrontation, Ms. Cooper told a dispatcher that Mr. Cooper was putting her in danger and claimed that he tried to assault her, according to a criminal complaint filed by the district attorney's office. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Cooper declined to answer specific questions about the second 911 call or about Ms. Cooper's potential plea deal. The clash between Mr. Cooper and Ms. Cooper began as he biked to search for birds in a semi-wild section of the park known as the Ramble, where dogs must be leashed.

`/u/Industriouskitten` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jb1llg/amy_cooper_made_2nd_911_call_to_falsely_accuse/):

> “Her lawyer, Mr. Barnes, said at the time that she would be found not guilty and criticized what he called a “cancel culture epidemic.”
> Ugh, this isn’t cancel culture, this is just what holding someone accountable for their actions looks like.

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube said on Wednesday it would remove videos from YouTube containing misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, expanding its current rules against falsehoods and conspiracy theories about the pandemic. YouTube said in a blog post that this would include removing claims that the vaccine will kill people or cause infertility, or that microchips will be implanted in people who receive the vaccine. Pattison said the WHO was encouraged by YouTube's announcement on coronavirus vaccine misinformation.

## US Supreme Court rejects SC's effort to cut off public funding for Planned Parenthood

Summary of [original article](https://www.postandcourier.com/health/us-supreme-court-rejects-scs-effort-to-cut-off-public-funding-for-planned-parenthood/article_d226d3ac-0d82-11eb-87ed-57cd781aca7a.html):

> The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a years-long effort by South Carolina leaders to cut off public funding for two Planned Parenthood clinics that provide abortions in the Palmetto State. "Today's Supreme Court order leaves in place a ruling that makes clear what we have long said: blocking people with low incomes from choosing the provider they know and trust is unlawful," wrote Helene Krasnoff, vice president of public policy litigation and law at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Conservative factions of the GOP-controlled General Assembly have sought to strip public funding from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers for years.

`/u/pyrothelostone` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jao4yx/us_supreme_court_rejects_scs_effort_to_cut_off/):

> We really need to change our tactics and push back hard with the fact that if we ban abortions people will still try to have them in far less healthy ways. Banning abortions won't save babies, it will kill mothers.
