## Archaeologists uncover ancient street food shop in Pompeii

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-pompeii/archaeologists-uncover-ancient-street-food-shop-in-pompeii-idUSKBN2900D3?il=0):

> 2 Min Read.ROME - Archaeologists in Pompeii, the city buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, have made the extraordinary find of a frescoed hot food and drinks shop that served up the ancient equivalent of street food to Roman passersby. Traces of nearly 2,000-year-old food were found in some of the deep terra cotta jars containing hot food which the shop keeper lowered into a counter with circular holes. "Our preliminary analyses shows that the figures drawn on the front of the counter, represent, at least in part, the food and drink that were sold there," said Valeria Amoretti, a site anthropologist.

> I visited Pompeii last year. I spent about 6 hours walking around and didn't even cover a tiny fraction of it. The pure size of that place was not what I thought it would be. Truly amazing to go to
