## Texas court: Facebook can be held liable for sex trafficking predators

Summary of [original article](https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/texas-court-facebook-can-be-held-liable-sex-trafficking-predators/QUMBHXN5ARBBTCNKRCH6EE43BY/):

> By. Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk.HOUSTON - The Texas Supreme Court ruled Friday that Facebook is not a "Lawless no-man's land" and can be held liable for the conduct of people who use the platform to recruit and prey on children. The lawsuits were brought by three Houston women who alleged they were recruited as teens via Facebook apps and were trafficked as a result of those connections, providing predators with "a point of first contact between sex traffickers and these children," the Chronicle reported. According to the Human Trafficking Institute, the majority of online recruitment in active sex trafficking cases in the U.S. in 2020 occurred on Facebook.

> Wonder if Facebook will go through the extra trouble and money to monitor potential predators or they’ll just put in their terms of service that if you live in Texas you waive your right to sue by agreeing to their terms.

## US fight against Covid threatened by growing vaccine gap in the south

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/27/us-covid-vaccine-disparities-south):

> "The common denominator is that these are Republicans stronghold states. These are all deep red states so what we're seeing in the US is the partisan divide around vaccination rates," said Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital. Uninsured people, who are less likely to be connected with a healthcare provider that can provide information on the Covid vaccination process, are disproportionately concentrated in the south, according to data from the US Census Bureau. With the mounting threat of the Delta variant and the gap in vaccinations in the south slowly narrowing, experts are concerned about how to more quickly get southern people, especially people of color, vaccinated and protected.

> Have we tried telling them that they aren’t allowed to get it? I feel like reverse psychology works on them a lot.

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/death-toll-climbs-search-survivors-collapsed-florida-condo/story?id=78519477):

> The death toll has climbed to nine from the partial collapse of a 12-story condominium building in Surfside, Florida, as a massive search and rescue mission continued into its fourth day on Sunday, officials said. Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said the Israeli Homefront Command Team and a rescue unit from Mexico have also joined the search. Burkett said during a meeting Sunday with loved ones of those still unaccounted for, that one of the relatives asked if the Israeli team thought that the Miami-Dade rescuers "Had been doing the right thing."

> They may never find remains for some of the victims. Twenty years after 9/11, we only have DNA remains for about 60% of the victims. The pancake collapse would crush everything into tiny fragments.

## More churches burn down on Canada indigenous land

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57626410):

> Two more Catholic churches burned down in indigenous communities in western Canada early on Saturday. The fires at St Ann's Church and the Chopaka Church began within in an hour of each other in British Columbia. Lower Similkameen Indian Band Chief Keith Crow told public broadcaster CBC that he was received a call early in the morning saying that the Chopaka Church was on fire.

`/u/northernpace` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/o8np40/more_churches_burn_down_on_canada_indigenous_land/):

> With the wave of latest grave discoveries, and likely more to be found yet, this reaction isn’t shocking. I’d only be shocked if it isn’t residential school survivors or their kids burning these churches down. Probably cathartic for the arsonists.

## Fifth body found at Florida building collapse site

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57626978):

> His report didn't suggest the 40-year-old building was at any imminent risk of collapse but he urged that the concrete repairs be carried out in "a timely fashion". "At the time of the building collapse, roof repairs were underway, but concrete restoration had not yet begun," the statement said. A study from researchers at Florida International University published last year found that the building had been sinking at a rate of two millimetres per year in the 1990s, which may have affected the building structurally.

> This Nick Valencia guy on CNN needs to stop reporting the way he is reporting. He Keeps saying that the family members are becoming unhinged and unraveled. Use better words. They are grieving, they are not a rabid mob.

`/u/Ok_Stranger702` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/o91a3t/10yearold_boy_fatally_shoots_himself_after/):

> If you think your kids won't touch guns that aren't secured, think again. My father left several in his closet. I remember me and my brother looking at them and we were elementary school aged. He must've noticed because he removed them, but he never said anything or scolded us. Sometimes I think about the stupid stuff we did as kids and wonder how we survived.
