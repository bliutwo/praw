## Alex Kearns died thinking he owed hundreds of thousands for stock market losses on Robinhood. His parents are set to sue over his suicide.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/):

> Dan and Dorothy Kearns didn't realize Robinhood had also approved Alex to buy and sell options, a risky financial instrument with the potential for huge losses. Dan and Dorothy Kearns believe that if a Robinhood customer service agent had responded to Alex's questions, Alex would still be alive today. In early September, Robinhood also added the ability for customers engaged in a certain part of the options trade process to request a call back from a live agent, a spokesperson said, and changed its protocol to "Escalate" customers who email for help with exercise and early assignment - trading situations Alex Kearns sought answers about before he died.

`/u/masktoobig` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lfc1ms/alex_kearns_died_thinking_he_owed_hundreds_of/):

> > What happened to Alex Kearns is of particular worry to Galvin and his team. In Massachusetts alone, they said, they found more than 600 examples of Robinhood customers who, by Robinhood's own standards, shouldn't have been approved for options trading, but were. 
> 
> > Alex will never know that he likely didn't lose money on his Robinhood trades. If he had cashed in other options he'd purchased, his lawyers said, he may have even made a profit. 
> 
> > "The information they gave him was just incredibly skewed. And possibly completely wrong, because they make it look like you owe $730,000 when you really don't owe anything" said Benjamin Blakeman, one of the Kearns family attorneys. "That could panic just about anybody."
> 
> So, this kid didn't owe them any money.  Robinhood was essentially his broker, and  I suspect that a broker misinforming their client would have damning consequences.

## Ghislaine Maxwell loses bid to keep deposition excerpt secret

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-ghislaine-maxwell-idUSKBN2A827J):

> 3 Min Read.NEW YORK - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's effort to keep under wraps an excerpt from a 2016 deposition that she fears could undermine her criminal trial on charges she aided the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and committed perjury. "While the court acknowledges Ms. Maxwell's interest in a fair criminal trial, Ms. Maxwell can argue all her points to the presiding judge in her criminal trial, as she has already." Maxwell believes prosecutors obtained the deposition transcript illegally, and it should be kept out of her trial.

## Tesla buys $1.5 billion in bitcoin, plans to accept it as payment

`/u/frank__costello` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lfc00i/tesla_buys_15_billion_in_bitcoin_plans_to_accept/):

> The really interesting thing is not Tesla, it's what happens after Tesla.
> 
> Tesla is not the first company to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, it's not even the most Bitcoin (MicroStrategy has about $3 billion of BTC).
> 
> But Tesla is the most high-profile, and this will surely bring in tons of media attention.
> 
> What could happen is this could kick off a wave of FOMO from large corporations. Every time a company like Tesla buys Bitcoin, it makes it less risky for the next company to do the same thing. But on the other hand, each company pushes the price up, so the later you buy, the less potential upside you'll see.
> 
> Here's the question: will Tesla kick off a wave of large companies buying Bitcoin? Will this bull cycle continue to be propelled not by retail investors, but by corporate treasuries?
> 
> And finally: how long until we see a central bank putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet?

> Well, that guy will probably wind up serving a long stint* for attempted murder. He could have just left earlier, grabbed a 30 rack, and gone home to safely drink with his buddies but instead chose to shoot a bar tender for enforcing a state mandate. 
> 
> Fucking absurd. 
> 
> This whole "me me me!" mindset from people is ridiculous. Wear a fucking mask and respect the business when they shut down.
