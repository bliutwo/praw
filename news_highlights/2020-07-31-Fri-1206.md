## Portland sees peaceful night of protests following withdrawal of federal troops

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/portland-protests-latest-peaceful-night-federal-troops-withdrawal):

> The withdrawal of federal agents from frontline policing of demonstrations in downtown Portland significantly reduced tensions in the city overnight. Without the federal forces to draw attention, protest organisers kept the focus on Black Lives Matters and reform of the Portland police. Wheeler apologised for the Portland police using tear gas in late May and June to break up Black Lives Matter protests.

## Ghislaine Maxwell trained underage girls as sex slaves, documents allege

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/ghislaine-maxwell-underage-girls-sex-jeffrey-epstein?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Add_to_Firefox):

> Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused underage girls and joined Jeffrey Epstein in directing Virginia Roberts Giuffre to be sexually abused by others, Giuffre claimed in a cache of documents that has been unsealed in the US. She "Trained me as a sex slave", Giuffre is quoted as saying. The documents stem from a 2015 civil action brought against Maxwell by Giuffre, who has claimed Maxwell lured her into Epstein's orbit as a teenager under the guise of offering work as a masseuse. "'It is your contention that 'Ghislaine Maxwell had sex with underage girls virtually every day when I was around her', correct?" Giuffre was asked during a May 2016 deposition contained in this document cache.

> >	The documents, they argued, are “extremely personal, confidential and subject to considerable abuse by the media”.
> 
> >	The Manhattan federal court judge Loretta Preska ruled on 23 July that they should be unsealed, however, saying: “The court finds that the countervailing interests identified fail to rebut the presumption of public access.”
> 
> >	Documents involving Maxwell’s deposition have not yet been released pending an appeal by lawyers for Maxwell.
> 
> In other words, the documents will expose a lot of powerful people she pimped out sex slaves to.

## Marijuana smell not an exhibit for search and arrest - Maryland’s highest court affirms

Summary of [original article](https://growcola.com/marijuana-smell-not-an-exhibit-for-search-and-arrest-marylands-highest-court-affirms/):

> Police officers may not search and arrest people based on marijuana smell alone, the highest court in Maryland has confirmed. The odour of marijuana, without more, does not provide law enforcement officers with the requisite probable cause to arrest and perform a warrantless search of that person incident to the arrest. Following the ruling, the state has argued that marijuana smell could indicate the presence of a larger amount of the substance, which gives police probable cause to search for more.

`/u/LPatchadams` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i13z3d/marijuana_smell_not_an_exhibit_for_search_and/):

> Now if only they can cut the bullshit on dogs wagging their tails as probable cause.

## US homeland security surveilling journalists covering Portland protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/dhs-intelligence-reports-journalists-portland-protests):

> The US Department of Homeland Security has been surveilling the work of American journalists reporting on the unrest in Portland, Oregon, circulating "Intelligence reports" on them to other federal agencies in a move that has been decried as a clear violation of the constitutional right to a free press. They referred specifically to two prominent US journalists whose reporting had revealed the disarray within the Trump administration's contentious deployment of federal agents to quell protests in Portland. The revelation that DHS officials had not only been surveilling the work of journalists covering Portland but had been disseminating their findings as "Intelligence reports" normally reserved for terrorism suspects or foreign adversaries prompted an immediate outcry.

## Exxon lost $1B in second quarter as oil use dries up

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/b45420c9d0fe9aac5341da6ec13b71ed):

> NEW YORK - Two American oil giants lost more than $9 billion in the second quarter as the pandemic kept households on lockdown, cutting a gaping hole into a once-thriving business as the need for oil diminished around the world. Exxon lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, and the Irving, Texas-based oil producer brought in $32.6 billion in revenue, less than half of what it brought in at the same time last year. As a result, the U.S. oil industry lost more than 100,000 jobs since February, with 45,000 of those jobs shed by upstream oil and gas companies in Texas alone, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.
