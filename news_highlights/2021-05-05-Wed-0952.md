## Trump's Facebook ban upheld by Oversight Board

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-s-facebook-ban-upheld-oversight-board-n1266339):

> Facebook was justified in banning then-President Donald Trump from its platform the day after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, but it needs to reassess how long the ban will remain in effect, the social network's quasi-independent Oversight Board said Wednesday. "The Oversight Board is clearly telling Facebook they can't invent new, unwritten rules when it suits them," said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a co-chair of the Oversight Board and a former prime minister of Denmark, on a call with reporters. Facebook created the Oversight Board last year as a kind of "Supreme court" to hear appeals from users like Trump who have had their posts removed or who want to challenge other sensitive or contentious moderation decisions.

> Here's an [explainer of how the board operates](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-05-05/factbox-what-is-facebooks-oversight-board).
> 
> Basically, Facebook took the 'final' decision out of its own hands and into a committee. There's 20 members (growing to 40) and they have about 90 days to decide if a ban is upheld or can be lifted. On the committee are a Nobel Laureate, several judges and civil rights advocates. They serve 3 year terms for up to nine years.

> If you're in school and bleeding for whatever reason the school should have a way to mitigate the problem. This makes total sense. My local school district has been this doing this for years and didn't need a state law to make it happen since it accounts for .0000000001% of the yearly district budget.
