Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/gamestop-point72-founder-steve-cohen-leaves-twitter-after-family-receives-threats.html):

> Steve Cohen, the founder of hedge fund Point72 and owner of the New York Mets, has deactivated his Twitter account after his family received threats this week amid the GameStop trading frenzy. Cohen, who purchased the Mets for about $2.5 billion in November, faced questions on Twitter about how Melvin's losses would impact the baseball team. Cohen on Thursday also engaged in a back-and-forth with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy on Twitter after Portnoy accused Cohen of involvement with controversial trading restrictions in GameStop on apps like Robinhood.

> I dont believe in making threats but his tweet "just trying to make a living" when he is a billionaire who has been investigated numerous times for unfair/illegal tactics was infuriating. "Let them eat cake" levels of arrogance

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/national-police-foundation-to-review-lapds-response-tactics-to-blm-protests/2514449/):

> The Los Angeles Police Commission announced Friday that the National Police Foundation will assess the LAPD's response to a series of large demonstrations that were held in the city following the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked protests nationwide. In its response to the BLM-LA filing, plaintiffs' attorneys wrote that the city and LAPD support the constitutional right to engage in peaceful political protests and were assessing the actions police took "On six historical, wrenching nights from May 29 to June 3.". In a federal lawsuit filed in June by the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, BLM-LA and Los Angeles Community Action Network, the plaintiffs maintain there were more than 3,000 people arrested over the course of several days of demonstrations and many were seriously injured by police.
