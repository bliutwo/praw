## Cat missing after Surfside condo collapse found alive

Summary of [original article](https://wsvn.com/news/local/cat-missing-after-surfside-condo-collapse-found-alive/):

> SURFSIDE, FLA. - One of the families struggling after the Surfside condo collapse was given what they called a miracle on Friday: their cat was found alive two weeks after the tragedy. Binx, who lived in unit 904 of the Champlain Towers South with his family, had been missing since the overnight collapse, June 24. The black cat was found wandering around the collapse site and a good Samaritan picked him up and brought him to a rescue center in Miami Beach.

> Binx was in apartment 904. From WaPo:
> 
> Split in half: The 04 units  
> In the end, their fate was determined by luck and an invisible fault line that became apparent around 1:30 a.m. that Thursday, when the central and east sections of the building fell away from the towers’ south side. That line ran through the 04 apartments, splitting them in half.  
>   
> In those units, the master bedrooms — and the people sleeping in them — were pulled down into the rubble. But the living rooms were on the other side of the fault line; they remained standing, and people in them had a chance to survive.
> 
> The family in Unit 904 experienced this divide. When the condos began to crumple, Angela Gonzalez and her 16-year-old daughter, Devon, went into a free fall and landed on the fifth floor. Though the impact broke Angela’s pelvis, she pulled her daughter from the rubble and escaped. Mother and daughter were later taken to the area’s largest trauma center.  
>   
> But Edgar Gonzalez, husband and father, vanished into the wreckage.

Summary of [original article](https://www.alreporter.com/2021/07/09/alabama-has-lowest-percentage-of-covid-19-vaccinated-residents-in-u-s/):

> Alabama, with 33.1 percent of residents fully vaccinated, held the rating of second worst vaccination rate for months, behind Mississippi, which now holds that spot, at 33.3 percent fully vaccinated. The percent of COVID-19 tests that are positive statewide increased to 4.8 percent on July 3, according to ADPH. Public health officials say it should be at or below five percent or cases are going undetected. Louisiana, with a 35.6 percent vaccination rate, saw cases rise 109 percent, and Tennessee, where 37 percent of residents are vaccinated, had a 169 percent increase in new cases.

Summary of [original article](https://liveandletsfly.com/hands-on-head-american-airlines/):

> Passengers were ordered to remain in their seats with their hands on their head for the final hour of American Airlines flight due to a "Security threat" onboard. What could have occurred for passengers to be ordered to place their hands on their heads for the final hour of the flight? While my first thought was a bomb threat had been called in. CONCLUSION. Passengers were asked to keep their hands on their heads for the final hour of American Airlines flight to Miami.
