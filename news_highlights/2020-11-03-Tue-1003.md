> 
> Anyone supporting the disenfranchisement of 100k+ voters simply because they think those people will vote for someone other than their preferred candidate is a disgrace of an American and doesn't want democracy.

## Sri Lanka rescues 120 whales after biggest mass stranding

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/03/sri-lanka-rescues-120-whales-after-biggest-mass-stranding):

> Sri Lanka's navy and volunteers have rescued 120 pilot whales stranded in the country's worst mass beaching, but at least two injured animals were found dead, officials said. The school of short-finned pilot whales had washed ashore at Panadura, 15 miles south of Colombo, since Monday afternoon in the biggest mass stranding of whales on the island. "We used our small inshore patrol craft to pull the whales one by one back into deeper waters," De Silva told AFP. "Sadly, two whales have died of the injuries sustained when they beached."

`/u/RememberThisHouse` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jn99gg/sri_lanka_rescues_120_whales_after_biggest_mass/):

> The ocean is too loud. [57% of strandings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972210/) by bottle nose dolphins and a good percentage of other odontocete whales (ie, toothed whales, such as sperm whale, the pilot whales in this story, and the more famous dolphins and orca, etc) show profound or near total deafness due to trauma. The proportion is much, much higher for mass strandings. This is because odontocetes all rely on echolocation to hunt and navigate which itself is reliant on their hearing infrastructure. You damage their hearing, you essentially blind them to effective ocean living. Damage is often caused by military sonar practices, but lately it's more commonly the fault of commercial ocean mapping expeditions using sonar in search of resources or exploration.

> The oceans are deafeningly loud. Once upon a time, certain whale species (the blue whale and sperm whale) could communicate across entire oceans. Right and bowhead whales communicated long distances over the Arctic and Southern oceans. Their hearing is _extremely_ sensitive. With modern shipping traffic, some whales are living in an auditory environment equivalent to human living next to a constantly running train. Their cortisol (ie stress hormone) levels are so high that many are no longer breeding and this has been correlated with exposure to shipping vessel noise.

## Covid-19 Live Updates: Birx Warns White House of New ‘Deadly Phase’ of Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/03/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates?referringSource=articleShare):

> Infection numbers are trending upward in 41 states, and more than 20 states have set weekly case records in recent days. In sending voters to the polls in the middle of an uncontrolled outbreak, the United States is trying an experiment that few other countries have attempted. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is now warning that hospitalizations in the state are likely to blast through the peaks of last April and could overwhelm the state's intensive care units by January.

> I remember in the not to distant past, getting stupid email forwards from dad with a picture of grave liners stacked up on a truck. It had the lovely title of "Obama is buying mass amounts of cheap coffins for when he releases ebola on the public" (or something to that effect). Could also have been from when he rounded up and executed all those Christians because he's a Muslim antichrist. Remember that one?

## Ethopia: 54 dead in schoolyard massacre

Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/ethopia-54-dead-in-schoolyard-massacre/YDX5JFQTXLPPMPCCTAJFYACUPE/):

> Survivors of a massacre by rebels in western Ethiopia on Sunday counted 54 bodies in a schoolyard, the latest attack in which members of ethnic minorities have been deliberately targeted, Amnesty International has said. Human rights groups are asking why federal soldiers left the area just hours before attackers moved in and targeted ethnic Amharas. "The government has failed in its duty to protect the safety of citizens," Dessalegn Chanie, a senior member of the opposition National Movement of Amhara party, told The Associated Press, adding that Ethiopia's language-based federal system is the main cause for the killings: "Ethnic Amharas residing outside of the Amhara region are being labelled as outsiders and are exposed to repeated attacks."

`/u/RoboJeffy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jn0y3i/ethopia_54_dead_in_schoolyard_massacre/):

> > Militants gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them," the Amnesty statement said. Survivors hid in a forest nearby. One told the human rights group he found the bodies of his brother, sister-in-law and three children in the schoolyard with bullet wounds.

## 109-year-old celebrates birthday days after recovering from COVID-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/109-year-old-celebrates-birthday-days-after-recovering-from-covid-19-1.5784607):

> Great-great grandmother Katie Bunio was joined by family members from all over Canada for a virtual celebration of 109th birthday. Katie Bunio, born Oct. 30, 1911, is living through her second pandemic. Around 2000, Bunio moved to independent living at the Kiwanis senior facility in Edmonton.

> I would be interested to see the survival rate of the 100+ age group. I have read a lot about this group and many causes of death drop much lower in this group than one would think. They seem to have a significant genetic advantage on the rest of us. It’s why you read them saying things like their secret to living so long is whisky and cigarettes. Some people just kick the rest of our butts with super genes. 
> 
> I have read papers by people who are trying to figure out what the 100+ crowd has in common to see if we can help the rest of us fight the things that get us earlier.
