## Trump campaign sues to halt Pennsylvania from certifying Biden win

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-pennsylvania-lawsuit/trump-campaign-sues-to-halt-pennsylvania-from-certifying-biden-win-idUSKBN27P30F?il=0):

> 3 Min Read.WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign on Monday filed a lawsuit in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking to block state officials from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The lawsuit claims Pennsylvania officials violated the U.S. Constitution by creating "An illegal two-tiered voting system" where voting in-person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail. The president, who has spent months trying to undermine the election results with unproven allegations of fraud, has pledged to go forward with a legal strategy that he hopes will overturn state results that gave Biden the win in Tuesday's vote.

`/u/Velkyn01` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jra5r2/trump_campaign_sues_to_halt_pennsylvania_from/):

> So the Trump administration expects me to believe that there was voter fraud, but only in states that Trump lost, and only from the heavily Democrat-leaning mail-in ballots, and only for President but *not* down ballot for House and Senate seats?
