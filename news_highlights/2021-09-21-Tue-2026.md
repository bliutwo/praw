Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-plastic-toys-reduction-happy-meals-2025/):

> McDonald's plans to "Drastically" reduce the plastic in its Happy Meal toys worldwide by 2025. McDonald's restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland already are offering only soft toys, paper-based toys or books, as the result of local petition drives calling on the chain to stop including plastic toys in its kids' meals, the Wall Street Journal reported. Burger King removed plastic toys from kids' meals in the U.K. in 2019.

> It’s not only unvaccinated dying from covid. Them occupying the ICU means having to fly car accident victims, cardiac arrests, strokes across the state, where many die in transit. Folks that wouldn’t have died under normal circumstances are dying because there is nowhere to give them care to recover

## A Black town’s water is more poisoned than Flint’s. In a white town nearby, it’s clean

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/21/benton-harbor-michigan-lead-water-poisoned):

> Finally, in 2018, they found out what was going on: tap water samples tested that summer revealed lead levels of 22 parts per billion - well over the federal lead action level of 15 parts per billion and higher, even, than the 20 parts per billion nearby Flint averaged at the height of the crisis that made that city a national symbol of environmental injustice. "All the cities around us got good clean water and we don't," said Clay, who recalled her children marveling about the water in St Joseph after she picked them up from classes there once. In the EPA petition, the NRDC, the Benton Harbor Community Water Council and 18 other groups said the water in Benton Harbor posed an "Imminent and substantial endangerment to public health" and called on the EPA to act now to resolve it.

`/u/compuwiza1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/pspfzx/misinformation_on_reddit_has_become_unmanageable/):

> The Internet itself is an unmanageable nonsense factory. It is not limited to Reddit, Facebook or any handful of sites. Lunatic fringe groups used to have to hand out pamphlets that never spread far, and could always be traced back to their source. Now, they have the tools to spread their libel, slander and crazy ravings virally and anonymously. Pandora's box was already opened in 1993.
