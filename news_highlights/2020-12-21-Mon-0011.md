## White House secures ‘three martini lunch’ tax deduction in draft of coronavirus relief package

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/white-house-secures-three-martini-lunch-tax-deduction-in-draft-of-coronavirus-relief-package/):

> WASHINGTON - The draft language of the emergency coronavirus relief package includes a tax break for corporate meal expenses pushed by the White House and denounced by congressional Democrats, according to a summary of the deal circulating among congressional officials and officials who are familiar with the provision. A proposal championed by the White House and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., would increase that deduction to 100%, allowing companies to deduct the full cost of a business meal off their federal taxes. At the White House in April, Trump said the United States should "Go back to the original" version of a tax deduction for entertainment and meals.
