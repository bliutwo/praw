## Driver of truck that killed 5 bicyclists on Nevada highway had high level of meth in his system, prosecutors say

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bicyclists-killed-crash-nevada-highway-driver-dui-charge/):

> The driver of a box truck that struck and killed five bicyclists on a stretch of Nevada highway last week, and told investigators he fell asleep at the wheel, had a high level of methamphetamine in his system, prosecutors said Wednesday. The flat-faced truck plowed into at least seven bicyclists trailing a Subaru Outback support vehicle amid about 20 cyclists making an annual 130-mile ride from Las Vegas through scenic desert in Nevada and California, according to the Nevada Highway Patrol and riders in the group. Two injured bicyclists were taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, and the driver of the Subaru, David Merrill, also was injured, the Highway Patrol said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rebecca-grossman-charged-murder-hit-and-run-crash/):

> A California philanthropist has been charged with murder for a hit-and-run crash this past September that left two young brothers dead. CBS Los Angeles reports Rebecca Grossman, 57, pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a Los Angeles County Superior courtroom in Van Nuys to two counts each of murder and vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, along with one count of hit-and-run driving resulting in death. L.A. County Sheriff's investigators say the driver, Grossman, sped away. The sheriff's department told CBS Los Angeles Monday that the drunken driving portion of the case remains under investigation and investigators are still waiting on toxicology results.

> Is this the same story posted earlier where she was identified as a "socialite" rather than "philanthropist?" Very interesting how the word choice there spins the story one way or another.

## Air Force: Black people more often investigated, punished

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-air-force-a0b9f4cca885c15af9d4a7a008bcc63e):

> One Black squadron commander who was interviewed, for example, said the only mentoring he received throughout his career was from other Black leaders. Senior Air Force and Space Force leaders asked for updates within 60 days on how to address a number of the issues, including the disparity in discipline and the fact that 60% of the Black service members surveyed said they don't get the same benefit of the doubt as their white peers if they get into trouble. Black troops were twice as likely to be apprehended by security and young Black enlisted members were twice as likely to be involuntarily discharged for misconduct.

## Indonesian fisher finds drone submarine on possible covert mission

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/31/indonesian-fisher-finds-drone-submarine-on-possible-covert-mission):

> An Indonesian fisher has found what experts say is likely to be a Chinese submarine drone in waters on a strategic maritime route from the South China Sea to Australia. An Indonesian security analyst, Muhammad Fauzan, told the ABC the drone was most likely mapping future submarine routes, given it was found far from Chinese waters and in a significant maritime route between China and Australia's northernmost city of Darwin. "But perhaps this latest discovery is a more significant one because first, it is reported that the drone is still active when the fishermen found it. They said that the drone was still moving and the light was still blinking and the forward sensors were still working. And this is the first time we have heard that the military publicly say that they have secured the drone and are conducting a full investigation of the drone which, according to the latest report, is currently being carried out in the second fleet headquarters of the Indonesian navy in Surabaya."
