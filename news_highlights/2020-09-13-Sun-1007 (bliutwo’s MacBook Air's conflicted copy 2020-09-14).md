## Chinese investment in Australia nosedives as distrust between two countries grows

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-13/chinese-investment-in-australia-takes-nosedive/12657140):

> Investment in agriculture collapsed but picked up slightly in both the construction and finance sectors. Chinese companies are increasingly focused on developing markets and Beijing is trying to stem the flow of capital offshore, with foreign direct investment from China dropping globally by almost 10 per cent in 2019.The drop in Australia has been much sharper, partly because the mining boom - which brought heavy flows of investment from China - has now tailed off. There have been a series of intense political controversies over Chinese investment in Australia in recent years, and the Federal Government has intensified its scrutiny of foreign investment more broadly.

## Willy Monteiro Duarte: Black man brutally beaten to death sends shockwaves through Italy

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/willy-monteiro-duarte-black-man-brutally-beaten-to-death-sends-shockwaves-through-italy-12069869):

> Hundreds of people in Italy have joined a funeral procession for a young black man who was brutally beaten to death in a killing that has sent shockwaves through the country. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Italy's interior minister were among those who attended the funeral for Willy Monteiro Duarte. News reports in Italy have quoted witnesses as saying Mr Monteiro Duarte was killed after coming to the rescue of a friend who was being beaten up.

`/u/aledex` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/irxyyc/willy_monteiro_duarte_black_man_brutally_beaten/):

> What this (embarassing) article fails to mention is that the 4 arrested where infamous for being a very violent group of MMA fighters, already known to the police and feared in the area. I mean, this is pretty much all of it, I sincerely doubt that the journalist could unwillingly not have found out about who these guys were.
> 
> In fact, the homicide was so violent and the proofs so strong, they are currently persecuted for first-degree murder (not involuntary), which is quite big news.
> 
> It's not hard to think that for such superior minds the fact the victim was black was another motive for beating him up, but to my knowledge at the moment there aren't sufficient proofs to add this aggravating circumstance. At the moment in Italy the fact that the poor guy was black is not the main point, the main point is that they fu\*\*ing killed a young guy just for the sake of it. You know, in Italy we have lots of problem, beating people up to death is generally not one of them.
