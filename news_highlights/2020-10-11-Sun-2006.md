> Facebook has one of the better reporting systems and they actually use it. They could NOT use it and have the lowest, but they don't. They report. be clear, other tech firms don't look at images or attachements to compare them to known pedophilia specifically so they don't have to report it and because it costs money to do it.

## Portland Police make blanket arrests minutes after Saturday protest starts

Summary of [original article](https://www.opb.org/article/2020/10/11/portland-police-make-blanket-arrests-minutes-after-saturday-protest-starts/):

Kevin Allen wrote in a statement that the "The crowd's posture, including their armored attire" suggested to police that protesters planned to have another event that could lead to "Arson, riots, and assaults on officers."

> It's a gang war at this point.
> 
> What really happened here is that the protests have finally shrunk to a level where the police outnumber the protesters.  And so they have the power to just rush in, crack skulls, and "win" the "protest" as a simple brawl.  So they did.  The video of this makes this really clear.   They just rushed in to thump these kids because they knew they could.
