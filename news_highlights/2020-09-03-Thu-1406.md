Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/910766c07afd96fbe2bd875e16087464):

> The Department of Energy has spent more than $400 million since 2014 to hasten the development of the small modular reactors, or SMRs."DOE is proud to support the licensing and development of NuScale's Power Module and other SMR technologies that have the potential to bring clean and reliable power to areas never thought possible by nuclear reactors in the U.S., and soon the world," said Rita Baranwal, assistant secretary for Nuclear Energy. The first small modular reactor is scheduled to come online in 2029, with 11 more to follow in 2030.The modular reactors are light-water reactors, which are the vast majority of reactors now operating. The modular reactors are also part of a much larger U.S. plan to replace current reactors, many of them decades old, with more efficient and safer reactors.

> I remember seeing the initial designs for this something like 15 years ago.  They were talking about having individuals or coops own them and sell their power to neighbors on the grid.  Having one was part of my "What if I won the lottery?" fantasies for awhile.
> 
> I thought it was just one of those ideas that never went anywhere.  I'm excited to see it still exists and is moving forward for actual, practical purposes.

## Active shooter drills are meant to prepare students. But research finds ‘severe’ side effects.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/active-shooter-drills-are-meant-prepare-students-research-finds-severe-n1239103):

> Active shooter drills became one of the most common school safety measures implemented nationwide in recent years, despite widespread fears that the procedures heighten anxiety, and evidence that school shooters, like the one in Parkland, Florida, use knowledge of the drills to their advantage. A report released Thursday, obtained in advance by NBC News, found active shooter drills in schools correlated with a 42 percent increase in anxiety and stress and a 39 percent increase in depression among those in the school community, including students, teachers and parents, based on their social media posts. The report, released by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, relied on research from Georgia Tech's Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab, which analyzed 27.9 million tweets and 1,454 Reddit posts that came from accounts with connections to 114 schools in 33 states that held active shooter drills in the 2018-19 academic year.

## U.S. court: Mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK):

> Seven years after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the mass surveillance of Americans' telephone records, an appeals court has found the program was unlawful - and that the U.S. intelligence leaders who publicly defended it were not telling the truth. In a ruling handed down on Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the warrantless telephone dragnet that secretly collected millions of Americans' telephone records violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and may well have been unconstitutional. The ruling will not affect the convictions of Moalin and his fellow defendants; the court ruled the illegal surveillance did not taint the evidence introduced at their trial.

> Full credit to the ACLU for this one. They kept fighting for this ruling even when a lot of the country had forgotten about the issue.
