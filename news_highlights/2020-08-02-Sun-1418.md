## Portland police record highest number of death investigations in single month in more than three decades

> Portland police are scrambling to respond to 15 homicides in the city so far in July. There have been a total of 63 shootings so far this month compared to 28 in July 2019, according to the Police Bureau. The 34-member team was disbanded July 1 as a result of budget cuts to police units that have targeted a disproportionate number of black people in traffic stops.

> I am pretty curious of why homicides have risen so much the last few months. It’s probably a combination of everything. The pandemic, civil unrest, economic fallout, etc.
