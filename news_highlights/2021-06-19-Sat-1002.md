> 
> One of the most fucked up things I ever heard in my life. Poor lady found out too and she definitely noticed.

## New Jersey has fully vaccinated 4.7 million people, a goal it met two weeks early

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/new-jersey-has-fully-vaccinated-4point7-million-people-gov-murphy-says.html):

> New Jersey met its goal of fully vaccinating more than 4.7 million people who live, work and study in the state about two weeks before its original target date of June 30, Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday. The milestone comes after an aggressive vaccination campaign that included door-knocking and incentives for residents of the state, such as free beer and wine, free passes to state parks and even dinner with Murphy and his wife. The state has also surpassed President Joe Biden's goal of getting 70% of adults vaccinated with at least one dose before the Fourth of July.

`/u/socratic-ironing` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/o3gpgi/new_jersey_has_fully_vaccinated_47_million_people/):

> Got to love the they way the Washington Post keeps running headlines that Biden will not make his vaccination goal by July 4th when it's all the red states that are dragging their feet.

> BUFFALO, N.Y. - Buffalo Bills receiver Cole Beasley does not plan to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and insists he will not follow rules jointly adopted by the NFL and NFLPA requiring unvaccinated players to stay clear of people. "I'm not going to take meds for a leg that isn't broken. I'd rather take my chances with Covid and build up my immunity that way ...I'll play for free this year to live life how I've lived it from day one. If I'm forced into retirement, so be it." Beasley said a lot of players agree with him and but many are not established veterans.
