> Absolutely heartbreaking.  After watching the video yesterday I thought, "there's no way only 50 are dead/trapped in that building, it's too big."  What a tragic mass casualty event, at least today it feels like it's getting the attention it deserves.  I know they keep hearing people trapped in the rubble still, I really hope they're able to get those people rescued.

## Judge rejects Chauvin’s request for new trial in Floyd death

Summary of [original article](http://apnews.com/article/derek-chauvin-sentencing-23c52021812168c579b3886f8139c73d):

> MINNEAPOLIS - Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin awaited sentencing Friday for the murder of George Floyd, whose slow death under Chauvin's knee set off a fierce and sometimes violent reckoning over racial injustice in America. Prosecutors asked for 30 years, saying Chauvin's actions were egregious and "Shocked the nation's conscience." The defense requested probation, saying Chauvin was the product of a "Broken" system and "Believed he was doing his job." Joseph Allen, 31, who is Black, said he would like to see Chauvin get a life sentence, adding that he hopes other police officers learn "Not to do what Derek Chauvin did."
