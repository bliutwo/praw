> A North Texas family and college campus is mourning the loss of a beloved registered nurse who came out of retirement to teach future frontline workers amid the COVID-19 health crisis, only to die of the virus, herself. Beginning in September, Mrs. Meda taught nursing students at Collin College as well as high school students earning dual-credit. Collin College District President Neil Matkin released a statement to NBC 5 on Meda's passing, stating: "On behalf of our Board of Trustees, students, faculty and staff, we extend our deepest condolences to the Meda family. Professor Meda's family shared that she was honored to serve as an instructor at Collin College, and we are sincerely grateful for her service to our students."

> So the lesson from things like this is that qualified front-line health care providers should just quit, or not rejoin the workforce.
> 
> I don't know if anyone is collecting data on this, but anecdotally, some are quitting. Many are being stressed to their breaking points, or to the point of making errors under stress.
> 
> Meanwhile the number of infections is rising nearly exponentially.
> 
> This is a really, really bad recipe for our near future.

## Pope, for first time, says China's Uighurs are 'persecuted'

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-book/pope-for-first-time-says-chinas-uighurs-are-persecuted-idUSKBN2832RU):

> 4 Min Read.VATICAN CITY - In a new book, Pope Francis for the first time calls China's Muslim Uighurs a "Persecuted" people, something human rights activists have been urging him to do for years. While the pope has spoken out before about the Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, and the killing of Yazidi by Islamic State in Iraq, it was the first time he mentioned the Uighurs. Last month, during a conference at the Vatican, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted China over its treatment of Uighurs.

`/u/Pochel` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jzpe4u/pope_for_first_time_says_chinas_uighurs_are/):

> I see a lot of people criticising the Pope for being late on that particular topic. I think you're being pretty harsh towards him. At least he's addressing that problem. Francis is extremely rushing the agenda of the Vatican: he's spoken about migrants, global warming, homosexuality, Tibet, Turkestan now... Honestly, he may be a bit slow, but he's doing really better than a lot of other heads of state.

> 3 Min Read.WASHINGTON - The White House plans to hold an indoor holiday reception next week just days after Thanksgiving despite ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks at the compound, and against the advice of its own advisers who are urging Americans to sacrifice their normal holiday gatherings to curb the spread of the virus. While the White House has said President Donald Trump and Melania planned to remain in Washington for the holiday this week, skipping their annual Thanksgiving at Trump's private club in Florida, the holiday party comes just three days later. A White House aide and four others have tested positive in recent days.

## Elizabeth Holmes wants to block jurors from hearing about her luxurious lifestyle as Theranos CEO

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/21/elizabeth-holmes-seeks-to-block-jurors-from-hearing-about-her-luxurious-lifestyle.html):

> "The amount of money Ms. Holmes earned in her position at Theranos, how she chose to spend that money, and the identities of people with whom she associated simply have no relevance to Ms. Holmes' guilt or innocence," her attorneys wrote in a motion filed late Friday night. In the motion, defense attorneys claim that the prosecutors' motive argument is based on the assumption that Holmes' luxurious lifestyle may have motivated her to "Commit fraud to acquire or maintain that lifestyle." "The jury should not be subjected to arguments regarding Ms. Holmes' alleged purchase of luxury travel, 'fine wine,' or 'food delivery to her home'," attorneys for Holmes said.

> Imagine being accused of stealing so much money that your lawyers argue that the fact you spent it would prejudice the jury. Pure craziness

## Florida bar shuts down after hundreds of patrons gather without masks or social distancing

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-bar-the-wharf-fort-lauderdale-closes-no-masks-social-distancing/):

> A popular outdoor bar in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has shut down after hundreds of patrons gathered there over the weekend. After the bar attracted hundreds of guests, it was shut down by county officials by 11 p.m. on Saturday, Broward Mayor Steve Geller told the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Broward County's emergency guidance requires people to wear a facial covering in public and urges everyone to practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet from other people, avoiding groups and crowded places.

`/u/Brohozombie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jzme4i/florida_bar_shuts_down_after_hundreds_of_patrons/):

> I definitely called the health board on my local VFW, to which I'm a member. I repeated asked the Commander and other officers to social distance and to make sure the bartender wore a mask. I even brought it up in the monthly meeting. No one wanted to listen and they got shut down for a couple weeks. The VFW may be a "private club" as they like to say, but it has a state liquor license and has to follow rules to protect the member, many of whom are very old.
> 
> I'm so tired of the older generation of veterans making us younger combat vets look like assholes.
> 
> Edit: These events take place in Michigan, but were relevant due to the lack of concern for other humans. If you are a veteran and you are anti-mask then you are basically pissing on the oath you took to defend the US against all enemies foreign and domestic.

## Police: Dying Alabama man preparing to ‘meet his maker’ confesses to 25-year-old cold case murder

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending/dying-alabama-man-preparing-meet-his-maker-confesses-25-year-old-cold-case-murder/BAWJBDAMXNAV5F6EWLK5SPDUAA/):

> The caller, Johnny Dwight Whited, 53, of Trinity, was charged Wednesday with murder in the 1995 killing of Christopher Alvin Dailey, 26, of Huntsville. The New York Times reported that Whited called the police switchboard on Wednesday and was transferred twice before his call landed with Mukaddam. According to the Times, the detective downplayed his own role in the cold case arrest and credited his predecessors with compiling the evidence that allowed authorities to determine that Whited's story was a legitimate one.

> The guy is only confessing because he’s dying and probably thinks that he’ll go to hell for what he did. He’s a real piece of shit for letting the Dailey family wait 25 years for closure.
