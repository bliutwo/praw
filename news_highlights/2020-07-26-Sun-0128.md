Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12343977):

> Women who have alleged they were sexually assaulted by actor Danny Masterson have claimed The Church of Scientology tried to silence them.

One of the lawyers for the civil suit, Stewart Ryan, said: "It is alleged that our clients reported the sexual assaults to Scientology at the times that they happened. It is alleged in the suit that Scientology attempted to cover up the sexual assaults."

## Thousands of protesters gather in Seattle in solidarity with Portland; fire breaks out at site of youth detention facility under construction

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2020/07/thousands-of-protesters-gather-in-seattle-in-solidarity-with-portland-fire-breaks-out-at-site-of-youth-detention-facility-under-construction.html):

> By SALLY HO and CHRIS GRYGIEL.SEATTLE - Seattle police declared a riot Saturday following large demonstrations in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood and deployed flash bangs and pepper spray to try to clear an area near where weeks earlier people had set up an "Occupied protest zone" that stretched for several blocks. Prior to Saturday's protests Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best had announced officers would be armed with pepper spray and other weapons, promising officers would not use tear gas and urging demonstrators to remain peaceful. The U.S. Department of Justice, citing Seattle's longstanding police consent decree, successfully argued that banning the use of crowd control weapons could actually lead to more police use of force, leaving them only with more deadly weapons.

So, we burnt everything in the trash can of history, right there," said Stilp following the event.
