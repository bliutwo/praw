> > Kue searched his vehicle, DPD records show, finding he had no criminal history, no drugs and no stolen weapons. But before he left, Brown says Kue gave him a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt—even though he maintains he was seated in a parked car— and used a racist slur.

> > ...
> 
> > “They rolled the window down and they asked us: Do we have any guns or drugs on us?” Reed recalled.
> 
> > “We said no, they told us to lift up our shirt and do a complete circle so they could see our waistband,” he said. “We complied.”
> 
> > He said Kue handcuffed both brothers, searched them but found nothing on their persons. But when he found that DeAndre had an outstanding traffic warrant, he said Kue uttered a racist slur.
> 
> > ...
> 
> > “They asked me, can they search me?” Collins said. “I said no, I haven’t did nothing.”
> “My trigger finger is itching. I dare you to move. I dare you to move."
> 
> > Kue and his partner frisked Collins anyway, later saying he was impeding traffic when he crossed the street. Collins was not found to be in possession of anything illegal.
> 
> I wonder how many illegal searches this guy has conducted over his 12 years terrorizing the people of Detroit. Hopefully someone takes the time to go over his arrests with a fine tooth comb.
> 
> > When internal affairs investigated, Kue said he never fired his weapon, but ballistics confirmed that wasn’t true. When confronted, Kue said he just forgot.
> 
> Could you imagine pulling this off and not getting charged with a crime or fired? Blows my mind.

## The FTC Votes Unanimously to Enforce Right to Repair

Summary of [original article](https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-votes-to-enforce-right-to-repair/):

> The Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously to enforce laws around the Right to Repair, thereby ensuring that US consumers will be able to repair their own electronic and automotive devices. The FTC's endorsement of the rules is not a surprise outcome; the issue of Right to Repair has been a remarkably bipartisan one, and the FTC itself issued a lengthy report in May that blasted manufacturers for restricting repairs. The FTC vote is another win for the Right to Repair movement in the US, which has been led by advocacy groups like the US Public Interest Research Group, as well as private companies like iFixit, the California-based company that sells gadget repair kits and publishes repair manuals for DIY tinkerers.

> Tesla is another abuser. If you repaired their car Tesla will not let you supercharge even if they inspected the car. But this should apply to everything. HP will not let you swap HP toner cartridges between same printers. There is known air purifier that will NOT let you swap the filters, because they chipped them. We had cold press that would not work, unless the chipped strainer replaced every 15 times, with very expensive chipped part. This cr@p produces a ton of electronic waste.

## US virus cases nearly triple in 2 weeks amid misinformation

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/health-religion-coronavirus-pandemic-michael-brown-dbc0303c3fa13643ca2dc0eb8d806f33):

> In New York City, workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or get tested weekly as officials battle a rise in COVID-19 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. De Blasio's order will not apply to teachers, police officers and other city employees, but it's part of the city's intense focus on vaccinations amid an increase in delta variant infections. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated, compared with about 60% of public hospital system staffers, said system leader Dr. Mitchell Katz.Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials say the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.

> >They're demanding an end to mandatory overtime and 84-hour weeks that they argue leaves little room for a meaningful quality of life. They're also seeking raises that match cost-of-living increases.
> 
> Nobody should have to work 84 hours a week and still worry they can't afford cost of living. Especially when they work for the subsidiary of a company that generates billions of profit annually. It's abhorrent.

> Good, I don't see anyone having a problem with this. A common talking point from pro 2A advocates is that we don't need new gun laws, we just need to enforce the laws we already have. This will at least stop some people with violent criminal records from getting their hands on a weapon.

## In A Historic Reform, Elected Civilians Will Now Help Oversee Chicago’s Police Department

Summary of [original article](https://www.wbez.org/stories/chicago-approves-historic-police-oversight-plan/df28effb-d2f8-46e5-9bb8-3269ff34c5e9):

> Chicago aldermen reached a major milestone in police reform Wednesday by passing a long-awaited measure to implement elected civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department. The ordinance, passed 36 to 13, is a compromise between two previously competing proposals from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who campaigned on beefing up civilian oversight of the police in the years following Laquan McDonald's killing, and community activists who've been pushing for several different iterations of police oversight for years. Various oversight boards have existed and been dissolved over time, but the push for a civilian oversight body ramped up after police officer Jason Van Dyke killed teenager Laquan McDonald.

`/u/very_excited` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/op53nd/in_a_historic_reform_elected_civilians_will_now/):

> This new law creates one of the strongest civilian oversight commissions in the country:
> 
> > The new commission will play a key role in hiring future police superintendents and will have unilateral power to hire and fire the head of the city agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct.
> 
> > It would also have the authority to draft, review and approve new policies, and it would be authorized to start the process of removing a superintendent by adopting a resolution of no confidence.
> 
> No matter how you feel about the police, I think more oversight and accountability is a net positive thing, and it's a huge asset for the people to have a direct say in who is a part of this commission. I'm glad to see Chicago has taken these steps to ensure police accountability, and I hope that we'll see more civilian oversight commissions being established throughout the country.
