## Trump loses election challenge lawsuit in Wisconsin, further cementing Biden win in presidential race

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/12/trump-loses-wisconsin-election-lawsuit-cemeting-biden-win.html):

> The judge in the case, Brett Ludwig, who was appointed by Trump to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, on Thursday held a hearing where the president's lawyers made their arguments to set aside the result of the state's popular election, which Biden won by more than 20,000 votes. Trump's lawyers had argued that guidance issued by the Wisconsin Elections Commission related to absentee ballots, "Along with election officials' conduct in reliance on that guidance," deviated so much from state election law "That the election was itself a 'failure,'" Ludwig wrote. Trump has claimed for weeks that he was swindled out of a win in the national election, and by extension in the Electoral College, by illegal changes to voting procedures in a number of states, and by widespread fraud in states that sealed Biden's victory.

> Just a reminder for Republicans that Democrats introduced numerous election security bills last year, ones that would guarantee a paper trail with electronic machines and make audits commonplace when certifying election results.
> 
> Want to guess which party blocked these bills? And do you know what their objection was? Those bills would also force states to provide a set number of voting machines per capita so people wouldn't have to spend 5 hours in line to vote. The madness!

## Ghislaine Maxwell to offer $28.5 million bond in effort to get out of jail

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-maxwell-offer-285-million-bond-effort-jail/story?id=74667916&cid=clicksource_4380645_2_heads_hero_live_headlines_hed):

> At a detention hearing shortly after Maxwell's arrest in July, a federal prosecutor told the court that Maxwell had refused to provide information about the identity or assets of her previously unknown spouse. At Maxwell's initial detention hearing in July, federal prosecutors conceded that they were not alleging that Maxwell presented a danger to society if released on bail, but argued that her finances were "Opaque" and that she was the "Very definition of a flight risk." "[T]the Department of Justice is seeking to repair the BOP's tarnished reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions, not in any response to Ms. Maxwell's requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a completely different inmate," wrote Bobbi Sternheim, an attorney for Maxwell, in a letter to the court earlier this week.

>  From the first bond hearing: “"In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence," prosecutors wrote.

## With the Virus Surging, Arizona Teachers Protest by Calling In Sick

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/coronavirus-schools-arizona-sickout.html):

> The protest in the Chandler Unified School District, a sprawling string of suburbs east of Phoenix with 46,000 students, was planned in opposition of the district's recently announced plan to continue with in-person instruction in January despite a steep rise in infections in the region, according to a letter that teachers sent to the district on Thursday. The sickout represents a small fraction of the district's 2,000 teachers, and the district said it had found enough replacement teachers to keep all its schools open. Responses have differed widely from state to state and even district to district, as elected officials, teachers' unions, parents and school administrators have debated how to balance health and safety issues with concerns that students are losing out educationally under remote instruction.

> My district has remained digital the entire time, and just extended until mid-February. I don’t want to give any specifics, but with the number of students I know have had COVID so far, there is no world where I would be ok resuming in-person learning right now.

> Ok, so the story says it was a protest in solidarity with ICE detainees on a hunger strike but the photo caption says it was a BLM protest.  Were they one and the same, or is there an intention to mislead within the article?
