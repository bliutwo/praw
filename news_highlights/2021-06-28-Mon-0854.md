## French far right beaten in regional elections

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/regional-election-poses-crucial-test-french-78518043):

> Le Pen complained that the organization of the two rounds of voting over successive weekends had been "Disastrous and erratic." Still, the National Rally's showing in Sunday's decisive runoffs suggested that the party remains anathema to many voters. As in previous national and local elections, voters put political differences aside in coming together to prevent a National Rally breakthrough. Among the few who cast ballots, some lamented that young voters, in particular, appeared to be squandering the last voting opportunity before the 2022 presidential poll.

`/u/PermanentEvolution` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/o9ahkb/french_far_right_beaten_in_regional_elections/):

> Hopefully this worldwide populist movement spanning everyone from the Mexican president to Trump to Le Pen is just this weird little moment in the latter half of the 2010s that faded as quickly as it rose. You're seeing more moderate candidates winning all over the world. Maybe the pandemic showed people governments can actually do things and we don't need to burn the whole system down.

## 20 people found dead on boat drifting in Turks and Caicos

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-cad5707902879c86ac2d6315ee60a055):

> Fishermen spotted the small boat Thursday morning and alerted the marine branch of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, who towed the vessel ashore.

In June 2020, Sri Lanka-born Canadian citizen Srikajamukam Chelliah pleaded guilty to human trafficking charges before a Turks and Caicos judge and was sentenced to 14 months in prison.
