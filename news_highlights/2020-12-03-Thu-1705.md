> Keep in mind that the reason why relief bills are being held up by the Senate is not the price tag but the fact that the Senate wants to include a provision in the bill that protects employers from being sued for exposing their workers to covid.

> These politicians are part of the problem,  and I'm tired of people giving some of them a pass just for having a D next to their name.  
> Here in LA,  we had the infamous incident of our governor being caught dining maskless indoors after weeks of scolding tweets ordering us peasants to follow the rules.  Next,  a city supervisor declared outdoor dining so dangerous that it justified laying off thousands of workers without pay or aid.... and then went to celebrate her vote with dinner out.  
> 
> We already have a problem with people not taking these measures seriously. How the fuck do they expect people to make the huge sacrifices they're asking of us,  when they are themselves unwilling?
> 
> They want us to sacrifice our livelihoods, our children's education, our future,  our wellbeing, and even our HOMES. They can't be bothered to sacrifice their 300 dollar truffle pasta.  Fuck these boners. Vote them ALL out.

## Thousands without power, hundreds evacuated as new fires erupt in California

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-wildfires-thousands-without-power-hundreds-evacuated-as-new-fires-erupt/):

> Los Angeles - Southern California utilities had cut power to tens of thousands of customers by Thursday morning to reduce the risk of sparking new wildfires, as new blazes popped up regardless, forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes. Southern California Edison had cut power to almost 35,000 customers by early Thursday morning and was considering de-energizing lines serving a total of about 260,000 customers in seven counties throughout the windy period, which could last into Saturday. Virtually all of Northern California is in severe or extreme drought while nearly all of Southern California is abnormally dry or worse.

## Server takes glass to the face after Edmonton pub customer reminded of mask bylaw

Summary of [original article](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/server-takes-glass-to-the-face-after-edmonton-pub-customer-reminded-of-mask-bylaw-1.5214695):

> INCIDENT CAUGHT ON CAMERA. Shaw said her injury - a deep vertical cut between the eyes - was the result of escalating tensions that began when a woman was asked to wear a mask while walking around the pub. Shaw said it was during the struggle when the woman grabbed a glass and smashed it against her face. Less than an hour before the glass incident, the same female tried repeatedly in vain to order alcohol after Alberta's 10 p.m. cutoff, according to Shaw, who said the female got up from her table and approached a coworker at the bar without a mask.

## â€˜Nobody Sees Usâ€™: Testing-Lab Workers Strain Under Demand

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/health/coronavirus-testing-labs-workers.html?referringSource=articleShare):

> Caseloads have skyrocketed; America's testing capacity has increased since March, but it has been vastly overtaken by the demand for tests. Antibody test/serology test: A test that detects antibodies specific to the coronavirus. Antigen tests are fast, taking as little as five minutes, but are less accurate than tests that detect genetic material from the virus.

`/u/GrumpyOik` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k62uob/nobody_sees_us_testinglab_workers_strain_under/):

> I work in labs - I'm not going to pretend it's not been difficult over the last 8 months. Our workload doubled, redoubled, redoubled again. We went from 100 samples a day (for Covid) to about 2000 with only a very small increase in staffing.
> 
> That said, none of us are unaware of the picture outside. We have jobs, we have income. It might feel shitty working all hours - but it's better than losing your home.
