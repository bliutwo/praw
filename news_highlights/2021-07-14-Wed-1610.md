## US to begin evacuation of Afghans who aided US military

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/aghanistan-us-evacuation-7efdf3059a2d356b8d8506d991aca9f5):

> WASHINGTON - The Biden administration said Wednesday that it is prepared to begin evacuation flights for Afghan interpreters and translators who aided the U.S. military effort in the nearly 20-year war. President Joe Biden has faced pressure from lawmakers on both parties to come up with a plan to help evacuate Afghan military helpers before next month's U.S. troop withdrawal. Biden announced last week that the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan will end on Aug. 31.The firming of the date to end the war comes after President Donald Trump's administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1, 2021.

> I'm glad this is being done, and I understand that the pullout of US/NATO troops was being done quickly for a reason, but given the risks these Afghans took in aiding the coalition they really deserve to have been evacuated alongside their US counterparts.

## Amazon rainforest now emitting more CO2 than it absorbs

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/amazon-rainforest-now-emitting-more-co2-than-it-absorbs?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other):

> The Amazon rainforest is emitting a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to a study. The trees produce much of the region's rain, so fewer trees means more severe droughts and heatwaves and more tree deaths and fires. The government of Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been harshly criticised for encouraging more deforestation, which has surged to a 12-year high, while fires hit their highest level in June since 2007.Luciana Gatti, at the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil and who led the research, said: "The first very bad news is that forest burning produces around three times more CO2 than the forest absorbs. The second bad news is that the places where deforestation is 30% or more show carbon emissions 10 times higher than where deforestation is lower than 20%.".

## Delta variant now accounts for about 58% of COVID-19 cases in US, CDC says

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/delta-variant-now-accounts-58-covid-19-cases/story?id=78834579):

> After being initially identified in India in October, the delta variant has since been reported in at least 104 countries around the globe and is expected to soon be the dominant coronavirus variant circulating worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. "The delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and death," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus said during a COVID-19 press briefing on Monday. The WHO declared delta a "Variant of concern" in May, and the CDC upgraded its classification of the strain in June from "Variant of interest" to a "Variant of concern." Both the WHO and the CDC say that variants of concern have shown to be both more infectious and more virulent than other strains.

## KUOW - Nearly 700 people believed to have died in Northwest heat wave

Summary of [original article](https://kuow.org/stories/nearly-700-people-believed-to-have-died-in-northwest-heat-wave):

> That's three times the number of deaths the province normally sees each week, according to the B.C. Coroners Service, and reporting from the CBC. In Oregon, at least 116 people died from the heat, according to The Associated Press. Under historic heat, amidst a changing climate, dozens of people in Washington died between June 26 and July 6 from ailments including hyperthermia, heart failure, and heat stroke. Dr. Wayne McCormick, a gerontologist with the University of Washington, said that hydration was the main factor behind heat-related illnesses in people in their 80s, 90s, and 100s. Older people lose the ability to regulate their body temperature well, McCormick said.
