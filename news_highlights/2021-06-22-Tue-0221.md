> I was an Army Abrams Tank Gunner, and then a Tank Commander in 2004/05 (OIF2) Iraq. We spent most of our time operations out of Forward Operating Base Omaha, just outside Tikrit on Rt. Tampa. My company commander and his driver were killed the second week in country. Needless to say, from that point on, it was game on. 
> 
> One member from my tank platoon has already drank himself to death. Several have completely fallen off the grid. Some turned into absolute shitbags after Iraq. No one has really led an outstanding life. PTSD is a wild fucking ride, especially when you have no idea what the fuck is going on, and months of your memory is blacked out from events during your deployment.
> 
> PTSD is so difficult to treat, because there are so many different types/causes/triggers of the disorder. ~70% of soldiers intentionally fire into the ground or the air because they don’t want to kill. When you do that, and your buddy next to you is blown apart by the individuals you’re supposed to be shooting, that is a much different type of PTSD than the guy who was blown up driving down the road. Then there is compounding issues where an individual has numerous experiences causing mental trauma. This makes treatment for PTSD that much more difficult to find something that works. Pills, Horses, Dogs, Nature, Yoga, Meditation, acupuncture, Pilates, have all been a part of my recovery treatment. EMDR worked the best for me. Fucking amazing. I don’t take the pills. I smoke weed. I immerse myself in nature. I stay away from most people. I enjoy the company of my dog to people. I enjoy my time with my aging parents. I take pictures. I ride my motorcycle. I live. 
> 
> There is no one treatment that will work forever, but there is hope. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If you need help, there are some really cool people at 1800273TALK. They’ll hook it up.
