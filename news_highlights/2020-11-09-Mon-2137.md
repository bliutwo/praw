> 3 Min Read.WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign on Monday filed a lawsuit in a Pennsylvania federal court, seeking to block state officials from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The lawsuit claims Pennsylvania officials violated the U.S. Constitution by creating "An illegal two-tiered voting system" where voting in-person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail. The president, who has spent months trying to undermine the election results with unproven allegations of fraud, has pledged to go forward with a legal strategy that he hopes will overturn state results that gave Biden the win in Tuesday's vote.

> So the Trump administration expects me to believe that there was voter fraud, but only in states that Trump lost, and only from the heavily Democrat-leaning mail-in ballots, and only for President but *not* down ballot for House and Senate seats?

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Shares of firearms sellers tumbled on Monday as promising data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial knocked stay-at-home stocks, and as civil unrest failed to materialize after Democrat Joe Biden emerged as the winner of last week's presidential election. Smith & Wesson Brands SWBI.O and rival Sturm Ruger & Co RGR.N fell more than 9%, while Vista Outdoor VSTO.N, which sells ammunition and a range of sporting goods, fell over 12%.They were among several so-called stay-at-home stocks dropping after Pfizer PFE.N said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.Sales of sporting goods, including hunting gear, have increased this year as consumers spend more time outdoors due to the coronavirus pandemic. An absence of civil unrest following the election may also be hurting sentiment for gun stocks.

> 3 Min Read.GENEVA - Major powers, including allies, criticised the United States for its human rights record on Monday during a U.N. review, citing the use of the death penalty, police violence against African Americans and the separation of migrant children from their families. "What we saw today was unsurprising condemnation by many countries around the world of the United States' human rights record," Jamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union, told a news briefing. The case of George Floyd, an African American who died in May after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignited massive protests across the United States and the world, putting the country's human rights record in the global spotlight once again.
