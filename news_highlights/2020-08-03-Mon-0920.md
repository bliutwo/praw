## Thomson recalls all onions from the entire U.S. because of link to Salmonella Newport outbreak

Summary of [original article](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2020/08/thomson-recalls-all-onions-from-the-entire-u-s-because-of-link-to-salmonella-newport-outbreak/):

> Canadian officials did not immediately name Thompson onions, with the county's first recall related to the outbreak involving Sysco onions. Many of the onions are packaged for foodservice use and have been used in multi-ingredient foods so it is difficult for consumers to know whether the onions in such foods are part of the recall. "Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve red, white, yellow, or sweet onions from Thomson International, Inc. or products containing such onions. If you cannot tell if your onion is from Thomson International Inc., or your food product contains such onions, you should not eat, sell, or serve it, and should throw it out," according to the recall notice.

> Are salmonella outbreaks more common in the US, or do we just hear about them more because it's a huge deal when they happen?

## "Zombie cicadas" infected with mind-controlling fungus return to West Virginia

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zombie-cicadas-infected-mind-controlling-fungus-west-virginia/):

> "Zombie cicadas" - under the influence of a parasitic fungus - have reemerged in West Virginia to infect their friends, and now scientists have a better understanding of how it happens. Researchers from West Virginia University recently saw the return of these bizarre creatures, which are infected with a fungus called Massospora. The team researched infected cicadas that returned to southeastern West Virginia earlier this year.

> > "They're very docile," Lovett said. "You can walk right up to one, pick it up to see if it has the fungus...yellowish plug on its back end"...

> That's ok, really. I prefer to respect their personal space.

## Scientists inspired by 'Star Wars' create artificial skin able to feel

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-skin/scientists-inspired-by-star-wars-create-artificial-skin-able-to-feel-idUSKBN24Z13D):

> "So humans need to slide to feel texture, but in this case the skin, with just a single touch, is able to detect textures of different roughness," said research team leader Benjamin Tee, adding that AI algorithms let the device learn quickly. "So by recreating an artificial version of the skin, for their prosthetic devices, they can hold a hand and feel the warmth and feel that it is soft, how hard are they holding the hand," said Tee. Tee said the concept was inspired by a scene from the "Star Wars" movie trilogy in which the character Luke Skywalker loses his right hand and it is replaced by a robotic one, seemingly able to experience touch sensations again.

The 35-year-old Slatington man was charged Saturday with attempting to kill seven police officers near his home at 801 Main St. That shootout followed an incident Friday where Zaborowski allegedly shot at a clerk at Cigars International in Bethlehem Township.
