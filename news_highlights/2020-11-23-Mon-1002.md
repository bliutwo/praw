## Elizabeth Holmes wants to block jurors from hearing about her luxurious lifestyle as Theranos CEO

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/21/elizabeth-holmes-seeks-to-block-jurors-from-hearing-about-her-luxurious-lifestyle.html):

> "The amount of money Ms. Holmes earned in her position at Theranos, how she chose to spend that money, and the identities of people with whom she associated simply have no relevance to Ms. Holmes' guilt or innocence," her attorneys wrote in a motion filed late Friday night. In the motion, defense attorneys claim that the prosecutors' motive argument is based on the assumption that Holmes' luxurious lifestyle may have motivated her to "Commit fraud to acquire or maintain that lifestyle." "The jury should not be subjected to arguments regarding Ms. Holmes' alleged purchase of luxury travel, 'fine wine,' or 'food delivery to her home'," attorneys for Holmes said.

## UNICEF says to ship two billion COVID vaccines to poor nations in 2021

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN28300A):

> 3 Min Read.LONDON - Nearly 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines will be shipped and flown to developing countries next year in a "Mammoth operation", the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said on Monday, as world leaders vowed to ensure the fair distribution of vaccines. UNICEF said it was working with over 350 airlines and freight companies to deliver vaccines and 1 billion syringes to poor countries such as Burundi, Afghanistan and Yemen as part of COVAX, a global COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan with the World Health Organization. Even before the pandemic hit, access to vaccines was unequal with around 20 million babies not receiving vaccines that could save them from serious diseases, death, disability and ill health, according to the WHO."We need all hands on deck as we get ready to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses, syringes and more personal protective equipment to protect frontline workers around the globe," said UNICEF'S Kadilli, who is working with the Pan American Health Organization and the International Air Transport Association.

## Coronavirus: Jewish leaders outraged Hanukkah gatherings banned, Christmas ones OK

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7475417/coronavirus-hanukkah-gathering-ban-reaction/):

> Montreal's Jewish community is expressing outrage and disappointment that the Legault government is allowing groups to gather to celebrate Christmas together amid the continuing COVID-19 crisis, but won't let Jewish families gather in small groups for Hanukkah. While not a high religious holiday, Hanukkah remains an important date for Jewish families to gather together. Leaders of Montreal's 90,000-strong Jewish community say the decision smacks of favouritism.

> I mean... That's pretty fucked up. They shouldn't be allowing either right now. But it's definitely wrong if they're discriminating.
