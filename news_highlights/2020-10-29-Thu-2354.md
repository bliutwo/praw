## Facebook reports a decline in users in the U.S. and Canada

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/facebook-fb-earnings-q3-2020.html):

> Facebook endured a broad advertiser boycott during the third quarter, with more than 1,000 brands deciding to pull ads from the social network during July in protest of the company's policies on hate speech and misinformation. Election ads were particularly key for Facebook throughout the third quarter with the U.S. going into the final months of the 2020 general election. A CNBC analysis found that political advertisers in the U.S. spent at least $264 million on Facebook in the third quarter, which comes to about 3% of Facebook's estimated total U.S. revenue in the third quarter.

## Mail delays even worse across Pa., with 42% of Philly mail taking longer than 5 days

Summary of [original article](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/10/mail-delays-even-worse-across-pa-with-42-of-philly-mail-taking-longer-than-5-days.html):

> In its filing Wednesday, the USPS reported that nationwide, as of Oct. 27, 95% of incoming ballots were delivered within 5 days while 89% of outgoing ballots and 33% of campaign mailers met that standard. Delays in both the pick-up and delivery of those ballots raised concerns, since some blue collection boxes go days without being emptied and mail carriers say it's commonplace for mail to arrive late or sit undelivered overnight. Central Pennsylvania's figure of 69.4% of first-class mail arriving within five days is just shy of its low point of 67.5%, which happened shortly after the removal of the five sorting machines in mid-July.A number of other key metro areas, including districts in presidential swing states, witnessed significant mail delays that have worsened in recent weeks.

> At this point, no one should be mailing out ballots. Official drop boxes only.

> To summarize the full story:
> 
> He was in Tennessee for a friend's bachelor party in 2018, was returning to his AirB&B, forced his way into the wrong house, and started drunkenly yelling racial slurs and making death threats to the woman living there. He pleaded guilty to charges of trespassing and assault, and was recently sentenced to 15 days in jail and 3 years probation.
> 
> After his sentencing, the NYPD announced that they were beginning a disciplinary process against him, so he preemptively resigned before it could begin. This also forfeits his pension & health benefits.
