Not a very classy position is it, neither is your trashy little bitter personality towards white men.

## FBI director says antifa is an ideology, not an organization

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e):

> WASHINGTON - FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers Thursday that antifa is an ideology, not an organization, testimony that puts him at odds with President Donald Trump, who has said he would designate it a terror group. Wray did not dispute that antifa activists were a serious concern, saying that antifa was a "Real thing" and that the FBI had undertaken "Any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent extremism," including into individuals who identify with antifa. ADVERTISEMENT.That characterization contradicts the depiction from Trump, who in June singled out antifa - short for "anti-fascists" and an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups - as responsible for the violence that followed George Floyd's death.

## Sheriffs & Media Misidentify Innocent Compton Man as Cop Shooter

Summary of [original article](https://lasentinel.net/sheriffs-media-misidentify-innocent-compton-man-as-cop-shooter.html):

> Darnell could hardly believe what he was reading-that he was wanted in the shooting of two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as they sat in a patrol SUV at the Compton Willowbrook rail station. Renard Smith, a Compton resident and Darnell's former coach said, "I was shocked because out of all the youth basketball players I've coached in Compton, Darnell was not a kid involved with guns, drugs or gangs. When I initially spoke to him about this, after seeing it on social media, his response was very casual. I knew then, he didn't fully understand the seriousness of this issue. As a Black man, I also realized that this could be something recurring since the sheriffs have been known to show signs of aggression and retaliation towards residents." Attorney Brian Dunn plans to request that the Sheriff's Department's Civilian Oversight Commission open an investigation to see if the misidentification of Darnell Hunt originated with the sheriffs.

Now we are seeing more layoffs Airlines, tourism and companies closings. Hell even Fox News just announced layoffs. Whomever is President is going to have a mess on their table to clean.
