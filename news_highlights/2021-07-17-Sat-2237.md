## Canada's vaccination rate overtakes US

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57869947):

> If Canada's vaccine progress continues it may open its border to US travellers after a 16-month closure, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this week. In Canada, too, vaccine rates have slowed in recent weeks, after a steep upswing beginning in late March. With roughly 80% of eligible Canadians protected by at least one dose, Mr Trudeau said on Thursday that the country expects to begin allowing fully vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel, and international travellers in September.

> Not surprising when they still have people who want it.  Everyone here who did got theirs weeks, if not months ago.

## In Undervaccinated Arkansas, Covid Upends Life All Over Again

`/u/Sygfreid` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ombjwo/in_undervaccinated_arkansas_covid_upends_life_all/):

> While this article focuses on Mountain Home, even our major counties are well under 50%.  I'm sure some major towns/cities might be over 50% (Fayetteville, Little Rock, etc), but vaccination rates have fallen off a cliff.
> 
> Once vaccination began in March, I naively assumed I'd be waiting until June/July for my phase (phase 3 - general population), but I've been fully vaccinated since late April.  It was pretty obvious that the people that wanted/trusted the vaccine flooded sites early on, but that quickly fell off.
> 
> Now 2 1/2 months on I've stopped caring at this point.  If I need to get annual boosters/wear a mask so be it, but my sympathy has dried up for people refusing to take the simple step of getting vaccinated.  They would rather risk death than even "stoop" to getting vaccinated on a Saturday, from the comfort of their car.

## Reducing incarceration in 2020 did not lead to increase in overall crime in Baton Rouge, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_8aff7426-e68e-11eb-a5ec-bb76e92a5312.html):

> Despite the fact that Baton Rouge experienced its most murderous year on record in 2020, a decrease in incarceration rates during the pandemic did not lead to an increase in overall crimes rates, a new study found. The Criminal Justice Coordinating Council - a coalition of local law enforcement agencies - commissioned the study, which examined the pandemic's impact on crime, arrests and jail population in East Baton Rouge Parish and 10 other jurisdictions throughout the nation. Analysis of all 11 jurisdictions showed that despite concerns releasing inmates would endanger the public, shrinking incarceration rates had relatively little impact on reported crime rates last year.

> Question: Was the reduction in incarceration done at the same time as a reduction in arrests/policing/police budget/etc.?
> 
> To put it another way: Is crime really down, or is it only down on paper?

## UK looks to extend ivory ban to hippos and other animals

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57867935):

> The consultation puts forward three options: retaining the current ban on elephant ivory in the UK only, extending the Act to hippo ivory only, and extending it the five listed species. International Environment Minister Lord Goldsmith said: "The Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and sends a clear message that we are doing all that we can to save elephants from the threat of extinction."However, the ivory trade is a conservation threat for other magnificent species such as the hippo, narwhal and walrus that are at threat. Dr Mark Jones, head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, said: "Closing down elephant ivory markets is an essential step towards securing a future for elephants."However, by focusing only on the trade in elephant ivory, other ivory-bearing species could suffer as ivory traders and consumers turn to alternatives.

> 
> I worry we are absolutely fucked. Unless we go on a total war footing against climate change, we are absolutely fucked. These fires will worsen in coming years.
