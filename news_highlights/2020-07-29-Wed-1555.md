> Inside, along with electronic and other important items and documents, was what looked like a simple teddy bear. "At hospice her voice was different. Much softer. Not the mom I grew up with. That bear is the last memory I have of her speaking in her normal voice," Soriano told CBC. Soriano searched everywhere for the bear, accompanied by CBC news crews. This week, two men found the bear and returned it to Soriano at the CBC studios.

> Best part of the article: *”This week, two men found the bear and returned it to Soriano at the CBC studios. They said they took the stuffed animal from the man who took the bag.”*
> 
> I’m picturing two tough looking gangsters suddenly seeing the bear peeking out of a stash bag and smacking the thief upside his head. “You idiot, you don’t just steal a woman’s bear! Jeezus now we godda return this!”

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/4-alabama-corrections-officers-indicted-accused-excessive-force-obstruction-n1235155):

> Four Alabama corrections officers were indicted Tuesday on charges that they beat a prisoner on the ground or filed false reports about it, federal prosecutors said. Thomas and Sgt. Orlanda Walker are also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly filing false reports claiming that once the prisoner was on the ground "All force ceased," the Justice Department said in a statement. The federal grand jury indictments were returned less than a week after the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division released the results of an investigation that "Found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama's prisons for men."

> 
> That was in 2016 still hasn’t been done and our politicians claim “the leadership in prison is broken” like dude you’re a legislator you’re the leader.

## Florida man accused of illegally detaining Black 18-year-old heading to basketball practice

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-man-accused-illegally-detaining-black-18-year/story?id=72051445):

> Santos identified himself to the 911 operator as an off-duty officer, according to the call recording. Santos had left his job as a theme park security guard six months prior to the incident, but because his required security officer certifications were still valid at the time he confronted the teenager, he isn't being accused of impersonating an officer, prosecutors said. Still, prosecutors said, Santos had no legal authority to detain the 18-year-old.

`/u/frodosdream` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i06ofm/florida_man_accused_of_illegally_detaining_black/):

> *A former Florida theme park security guard has been arrested for allegedly acting like a "vigilante" when he "racially profiled" and falsely detained a Black teen who was on his way to basketball practice, prosecutors said. The 18-year-old was riding his bicycle during the early morning hours of June 8 when Luis Santos drove his car alongside the teenager.*
> 
> *"You work here? You live here?" asked Santos, 54, as he recorded with a cellphone, according to excerpts released by prosecutors. The teenager stopped and answered Santos' questions before the situation quickly escalated.*
> 
> 
> *"You're not going anywhere," said Santos, stepping out of his vehicle. "You're being detained. You're not going anywhere."*
> 
> *It took local sheriff's deputies about eight minutes to arrive after Santos' call, during which the teen, who kept his hands in the air, was terrified as Santos allegedly placed his right hand over his pants pocket in a "manner that made the victim feel as if the defendant may have a weapon, even though none was seen," according to the criminal affidavit.*

> ... Another would-be Zimmerman playing cop.

## Former Portland police officer, on desk duty after record brutality verdict, now accused of sexually harassing co-worker

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/07/former-portland-police-officer-on-desk-duty-after-record-brutality-verdict-now-accused-of-sexually-harassing-co-worker.html):

> A former Portland police officer whose beating of a man led to the city's largest police brutality jury verdict now faces a sexual harassment lawsuit from a colleague at the bureau where he continued to work as a civilian investigator. After telling her supervisors about the unwanted contact, P.L. filed a formal complaint against Bruders with her sergeant on Jan. 2, 2018.By mid-August 2018, Bruders' boss, then a lieutenant in the Police Bureau's Personnel Division, upheld one of five allegations against Bruders, finding he made inappropriate and unprofessional remarks about his co-worker's appearance and his presence disrupted the workplace. Davis found Bruder's decision "Reasonable,'' considering all the circumstances and declined to call for a more in-depth inquiry, Davis wrote in a memo to the district attorney in October 2011. Independent Police Review closed the case.At first, Jones said the Police Bureau never did a follow-up internal investigation into Bruders' assault of Cox after the trial verdict. According to Jones, the bureau spokeswoman, Bruder couldn't be re-investigated because it would have constituted"double jeopardy'' - examining his conduct again absent new information.

## Investigation shows VA took nine months to dismiss physician who taunted suicidal patient

Summary of [original article](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/07/29/investigation-shows-va-took-nine-months-to-dismiss-physician-who-taunted-suicidal-patient/):

> Despite claims of increased accountability at the department in recent years, Veterans Affairs officials took nine months to sever ties with a physician who told a suicidal patient she did not care if he shot himself, according to a report released by the VA Inspector General this week. The episode - which took place at the Washington DC VA medical center, just a few miles away from the White House - stands in contrast to President Donald Trump's frequent stump speech claims that "Anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired" thanks to legislation he signed into law in 2017. Veterans experiencing a mental health emergency can contact the Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and select option 1 for a VA staffer.

> That is nothing.   It took years to fire the Phoenix director of the VA where dozens of veterans died waiting for care.   She collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in the meantime.   The system is setup to make it extremely difficult to fire incompetent and negligent people.
