> I hate it for everyone.
> 
> Vets who went over there and came back changed, some of whom had their friends literally die in their arms. The same vets who also missed many life events back home, and ones who would never come home.
> 
> The civilians in Afghanistan impacted by all of this, and the ones caught in the crossfire who paid for being in the wrong place at the wrong time with their life.
> 
> The interpreters who face harsh punishment if they cannot leave.
> 
> And the people of the United States, who could have benefited more from $2,400,000,000,000 spent domestically.
> 
> At the end of the day, it’s reprehensible that people damn well old enough to remember Vietnam let this go on as long as it did, just to line their pockets. We had to rip the band aid off sooner or later, but this entire debacle is the fault of each administration going back to George W. Bush.

## U.S. ships nearly 500k COVID vaccine doses to Rwanda

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-ships-nearly-500k-covid-vaccine-doses-rwanda-2021-08-17/):

> WASHINGTON, Aug 17 - The United States is sending nearly half a million doses of Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine to Rwanda, including the first doses from the Biden administration's 500 million global pledge earlier this summer, the White House said on Tuesday. The move is part of the Biden administration's support for COVAX, the global vaccine sharing program with the World Health Organization to help distribute vaccines to poorer countries. U.S. President Joe Biden in June said the United States would donate 500 million doses of Pfizer's shot, made with partner BioNTech SE, and officials have said they would start shipping out in late August.
