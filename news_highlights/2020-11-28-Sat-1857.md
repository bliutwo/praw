> After reading the article, it sounds like the tribe wants to be able to determine how resources are used on their land. I don't know what else they want because the article didn't go into deep detail.
> 
> Apparently, the tribe doesn't always benefit when a company or the government uses their land. Also, they want to eventually not need government money.

`/u/ZalmoxisRemembers` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k2ptkm/this_archbishop_is_about_to_become_the_first/):

> This is a very sneaky title that will make uneducated people think something different. He is the first African AMERICAN Cardinal, aka this is the first time an African was made cardinal in AMERICAN Catholic institutions. There have already been multiple African born cardinals in Roman Catholicism. Peter Turkson is one and Francis Arinze is another. Francis actually almost became Pope in 2005 when Pope John Paul II died.
> 
> Edit: as an addendum for those of you pointing out the technical correctness of the title, my gripe with it was its lack of clarity, and in fact my gripe extends further into the article as nowhere in the article is this clarified for a reader.

## Kaavan, the world's loneliest elephant, is finally going free

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-55060433):

> Getty Images But on Sunday, the world's loneliest elephant will finally leave behind his desolate enclosure for a new life on the other side of the continent, thanks to the determination of a coalition of determined volunteers and, somewhat unexpectedly, the American pop icon Cher. The little elephant was Kaavan, who had - until that day - been kept at Sri Lanka's Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, according to Ravi Corea, a US-based Sri Lankan elephant rehabilitation expert. The exact reasons remain murky - as does the question of whether Kaavan was really an orphan - but we know that at some point in 1985, the young elephant ended up at a zoo in Islamabad. Marghuzar Zoo had been built just seven years earlier, but already a power vacuum had emerged at the top, into which a number of "Business mafias" had stepped.

`/u/jrnitc` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k2qyji/kaavan_the_worlds_loneliest_elephant_is_finally/):

> "Soon Kaavan could be seen eating out of Dr Khalil's hands, hugging him with his trunk as he took a bath at the pond while his new friend sang along one of his favourite songs from the traditional pop era being played on a portable sound system."
> 
> Somehow this brightened my day. If the story is accurate, this elephant must have been utterly distraught. Just the fact that he lost his aggression and apathy by being well cared for makes me happy.

## Black firefighters in NC allege racism amid larger reckoning

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-winston-salem-north-carolina-us-news-4f00af19682d96646afe63e9e5b93fc3):

> ADVERTISEMENT."It's a festering problem that has become even more disease-ridden and even more detrimental to the life of the individuals who work here because of the current chief," said 28-year veteran firefighter Thomas Penn, a leader of the group that calls itself Omnibus. Last year, a Black firefighter sued city officials in Lansing, Michigan, saying they did nothing to stop racial discrimination within the fire department after he received hostile comments and found a banana on his assigned firetruck's windshield. A white Delaware firefighter was charged in July with hate crimes and harassment after allegedly sending threatening messages to a Black paramedic and two part-time workers, one who is Black and the other white who has Black family members, the News Journal reported.

> Absolutely zero excuses for that kind of behavior. I hope that the victims get the restitution that they deserve.
