> > What happened to Alex Kearns is of particular worry to Galvin and his team. In Massachusetts alone, they said, they found more than 600 examples of Robinhood customers who, by Robinhood's own standards, shouldn't have been approved for options trading, but were. 
> 
> > Alex will never know that he likely didn't lose money on his Robinhood trades. If he had cashed in other options he'd purchased, his lawyers said, he may have even made a profit. 
> 
> > "The information they gave him was just incredibly skewed. And possibly completely wrong, because they make it look like you owe $730,000 when you really don't owe anything" said Benjamin Blakeman, one of the Kearns family attorneys. "That could panic just about anybody."
> 
> So, this kid didn't owe them any money.  Robinhood was essentially his broker, and  I suspect that a broker misinforming their client would have damning consequences.

## Tesla buys $1.5 billion in bitcoin, plans to accept it as payment

> The really interesting thing is not Tesla, it's what happens after Tesla.
> 
> Tesla is not the first company to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, it's not even the most Bitcoin (MicroStrategy has about $3 billion of BTC).
> 
> But Tesla is the most high-profile, and this will surely bring in tons of media attention.
> 
> What could happen is this could kick off a wave of FOMO from large corporations. Every time a company like Tesla buys Bitcoin, it makes it less risky for the next company to do the same thing. But on the other hand, each company pushes the price up, so the later you buy, the less potential upside you'll see.
> 
> Here's the question: will Tesla kick off a wave of large companies buying Bitcoin? Will this bull cycle continue to be propelled not by retail investors, but by corporate treasuries?
> 
> And finally: how long until we see a central bank putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet?

> It’s a shame that Tom Brady is taking spot light away from TB defense because holding Mahomes to zero touch downs was by far the most impressive part of this game.

## Afghan pilot reputed for saving US lives reapplies for asylum after being approved and later rejected

Summary of [original article](https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/afghan-pilot-reputed-for-saving-us-lives-reapplies-for-asylum-after-being-approved-and-later-rejected-1.661434):

> KABUL, Afghanistan - An Afghan air force pilot has again applied for refuge in the United States after the Pentagon reversed its previous decision to endorse his move. Pilots who report threats against them often receive little sympathy and may be threatened with punishment or even imprisonment, said Niloofar Rahmani, Afghanistan's first female fixed-wing pilot. Bashir Ahmad Vesa mourns the death of his brother, Massoud Atal, an Afghan pilot shot by gunmen in Kabul, Afghanistan on Dec. 30, 2020.

> If somebody risks their life to defend American soldiers, they deserve to have their lives defended by the US. Simple as that. 
> 
> Anything less is betrayal.

> Well, that guy will probably wind up serving a long stent for attempted murder. He could have just left earlier, grabbed a 30 rack, and gone home to safely drink with his buddies but instead chose to shoot a bar tender for enforcing a state mandate. 
> 
> Fucking absurd. 
> 
> This whole "me me me!" mindset from people is ridiculous. Wear a fucking mask and respect the business when they shut down.
