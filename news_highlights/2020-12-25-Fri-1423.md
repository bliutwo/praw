> The scariest part to me as a resident of LA county is that so many people are still out and about, clearly not caring at all about the pandemic. Chin diapers as far as the eye can see. Sure there’s social distancing in the stores. But the folks lining the streets to go shopping aren’t practicing safety at all. Really discouraging to those of us who have been staying in as much as possible since March.

`/u/ChiGuy6124` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/kk60zq/lawsuits_police_beat_and_falsely_arrested_marcher/):

> "Two new lawsuits accuse Des Moines police of illegally arresting and assaulting a demonstrator and a news photographer during protests for racial justice this summer."
> 
> " Nieters and Foote are seeking compensation for injuries and other losses as well as damages for libel and violations of their constitutional rights. **Both were charged with crimes related to the protests that later were dismissed for lack of evidence, according to court records. "**
> 
> "According to Foote's complaint, she had left the protests and was walking back to her car early on the morning of May 31 when she saw a group of police officers coming toward her. The complaint says one officer sprayed her in the eyes with pepper spray, and then up to four officers, whose names she does not know, pushed her down with riot shields, struck her with batons, shattered her glasses and knelt on her back before arresting her. According to the lawsuit, at no point did police give any orders that Foote disobeyed, and nobody around her was breaking the law at the time of her arrest. "
> 
> " Like Foote, Nieters claims in his suit that he was never given any commands by officers before he was attacked. Although he has covered foreign conflict zones and countries under authoritarian regimes, the complaint says Nieters had "never before been arrested and jailed simply for doing his job."
> 
> "Both suits bring counts against the offices of illegal seizure, excessive force and retaliation for speech protected under the U.S. and Iowa constitutions, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, libel, and assault and battery. They also say Police Chief Dana Wingert and the city failed to train and supervise the officers."
> 
> " Foote said taking part in the protests, [which followed the death of George Floyd](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/picture-gallery/news/2020/06/08/george-floyd-protests-updates-on-demonstrations-in-iowa-des-moines-police-black-lives-matter/3161760001/) at the hands of Minneapolis police in May, and her own experience being arrested have opened her eyes to injustice in a way they never were before. Her lawsuit, she said, is an effort to shine a light on police misconduct and open others' eyes, as well.

> Yeah, we can't be bothered to try to keep them out of our elections, but we're over there helping to poison his opponents...that'll show him.
