## Major medical groups call for employers to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for health care workers

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/health/vaccine-mandate-health-care-workers/index.html):

> As the number of Covid-19 cases surges in the United States, more than 50 health care groups - including the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association - issued a joint statement calling for all health care and long-term care employers to mandate employees be vaccinated against Covid-19. "Our health care organizations and societies advocate that all health care and long-term care employers require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the logical fulfillment of the ethical commitment of all health care workers to put patients as well as residents of long-term care facilities first and take all steps necessary to ensure their health and well-being," they wrote in the joint statement issued Monday. "Because of highly contagious variants, including the Delta variant, and significant numbers of unvaccinated people, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are once again rising throughout the United States. Vaccination is the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures," the statement added.

> Speaking as someone who works in a large hospital chain that hasn’t required vaccinations, I cannot upvote this enough.  I can’t wrap my head around not mandating it in healthcare.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-will-not-lift-travel-restrictions-citing-delta-variant-official-2021-07-26/):

> WASHINGTON, July 26 - The United States will not lift any existing travel restrictions "At this point" due to concerns over the highly transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant and the rising number of U.S. coronavirus cases, a White House official told Reuters. "Given where we are today with the Delta variant, the United States will maintain existing travel restrictions at this point," the official told Reuters, citing the spread of the Delta variant in the United States and abroad."Driven by the Delta variant, cases are rising here at home, particularly among those who are unvaccinated and appear likely continue to increase in the weeks ahead.". The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed on China in January 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19 and other countries have been added since then - most recently India in early May.Last week, the U.S. Homeland Security Department said U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least Aug. 21 - even as Canada said it would begin allowing in fully vaccinated American tourists starting Aug. 9.

## Russia blocks Kremlin critic Navalny's website

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210726-russia-blocks-kremlin-critic-navalny-s-website):

> Protesters hold a sign during a peaceful rally to speak up against political repressions, human rights violations and antidemocratic rule in Russia, during a demonstration in Geneva, Switzerland, Tuesday, June 15, 2021. The move comes just weeks ahead of a September parliamentary election and follows a court ruling in June which approved prosecutors' request to declare organisations linked to Navalny as extremist, effectively outlawing them. Navalny's team is promoting a so-called "Smart voting" strategy to back the ruling United Russia party's strongest opponents in every constituency in the September election.

`/u/DontCallMeTodd` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/orzbe6/russia_blocks_kremlin_critic_navalnys_website/):

> In reality, Putin is a little bitch. Too cowardly to fairly test himself against political foes.
