## Proud Boys leader trying to rebrand the group as explicitly antisemitic

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/proud-boys-leader-trying-to-rebrand-the-group-as-explicitly-antisemitic-648831):

> One of the leaders of the Proud Boys, the far-right group that President Donald Trump told to "Stand back and stand by" during a presidential debate, is trying to rebrand the organization as explicitly white supremacist and antisemitic. Kyle Chapman, the founder of a "Tactical defense arm" of the Proud Boys known for engaging in street violence, claimed in a message on the encrypted chat app Telegram that he has staged a "Coup" against the current leader of the Proud Boys - a Black man named Enrique Tarrio. At the first presidential debate in September, when asked if he denounced the group, Trump told the Proud Boys to "Stand back and stand by." Trump later said he didn't know about the group and told it to "Stand down." But the group adopted "Stand back and stand by" as a rallying cry, sparking fears that Trump's words would encourage far-right groups to foment unrest on Election Day.

## Post-election audits find no fraud in Arizona

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-trump-us-election-news-11-12-20/h_98a625dddebc622aa30eb510a0514e1f):

> Audits in Arizona's four largest counties, which comprised 86% of all votes for president in the state, turned up no evidence of the systematic voter fraud that President Trump has complained about. Earlier on Thursday, Trump tweeted, "From 200,000 votes to less than 10,000 votes. If we can audit the total votes cast, we will easily win Arizona also!" The numbers he cited were inaccurate - Biden's lead in Arizona hasn't dipped below 10,000. Under state law, bipartisan audit boards routinely conduct hand-count audits of early ballots and Election Day ballots in all of Arizona's 15 counties.

## Dr. Fauci says ‘help is on the way’ with vaccines, but doubts Covid can ever be eradicated

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/coronavirus-dr-fauci-says-he-doubts-whether-covid-can-be-eradicated.html):

> LONDON - White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on Thursday said a vaccine to bring an end to the pandemic now appears to be on the horizon, but warned it may not be enough to help eradicate the disease. Speaking at a webinar event hosted by think tank Chatham House, the U.S.'s leading expert on infectious disease dismissed the idea that people may become complacent following a breakthrough in the race to deliver a safe and effective vaccine. "Countries have been promising vaccines, at least the political leaders, and that's good but the public doesn't understand all about vaccines including that this disease may, even with vaccines, become endemic."

`/u/Morat20` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jsw69j/dr_fauci_says_help_is_on_the_way_with_vaccines/):

> It doesn't need to go away. With a vaccine, we can strangle it's ability to cause outbreaks. 
> 
> We haven't eradicated measles, but it's under control -- well, it mostly *was*, then those fucking anti-vax morons showed up.
> 
> I blame Facebook. Goddamn cesspool of self-extremising bullshit. That's when they're not deliberately feeding you more extremist shit to radicalize you and *keep you on facebook with the only people who agree with your dumb ass*.

> The Dalai Lama has appealed to world leaders to take urgent action against climate change, warning of ecological destruction affecting the lives of billions and ruining the planet, including his birth country, Tibet.

## COVID-19 is so bad in Wisconsin, DHS needed a whole new category

> I live in a rural community in northern Wisconsin where we kept my daughter home and she is doing virtual learning. The school district calls every time there is a positive case at school (student/teacher and which school). They calls have ramped up so much that they had to stop calling for every positive case and now call at 5pm every day and give daily positive case counts. Needless to say, I feel we made the right choice.

## 'We won': Indigenous group in Canada scoops up billion dollar seafood firm

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/12/canada-clearwater-seafoods-mikmaq-first-nation-fishing):

> For generations, Indigenous peoples in Canada have watched, often in frustration, as commercial industries profit from the land and waters their ancestors once harvested. This week excitement replaced irritation as a group of First Nations announced plans to scoop up one of the largest seafood companies in North America. Heralded as the "Single largest investment in the seafood industry by any Indigenous group in Canada", the landmark deal comes at a critical moment for Indigenous communities in the region, as tensions remain high over their treatied fishing rights.

`/u/Moonlapsed` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jswsby/we_won_indigenous_group_in_canada_scoops_up/):

> This is a huge win for both sides honestly.  
> 
> 
> Instead of hurr'ing and durr'ing about how to define a "moderate living" for indigenous in the current law, they straight up bought a company with a license and can bypass most of the social unrest.

> Now what will Uncle Joe do with the Lobster fishing south of the river?
