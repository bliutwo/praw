> Her mother wrote a book called Through the Storm that talks about all of the alcoholism and abuse Britney's father put the family through, and to think he is now in control of her entire life is mind blowing. Guardianship abuse is a very real thing that gets almost zero news coverage. His wife is estranged, Britney is estranged, Britney's sons have a restraining order against him for physically abusing one of them last year. It doesn't make any sense why this alcoholic abuser has been given full control of not only her money, but decisions like her food, medication and relationship arrangements. Earlier in the year, her son was on Instagram Live and when someone asked about his grandfather, he said "he's a piece of shit. He can go fucking die." She can't even hire an attorney to fight it because she has been deemed incompetent to hire legal counsel. It's disgusting.

> Officials in Danbury, Connecticut, say they will name their sewage plant after the comedian John Oliver, in retaliation for an expletive-filled rant about the city on his HBO show. "We are going to rename it the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant," the Republican mayor said. Noting Danbury's "Charming railway museum" and its "Historic Hearthstone Castle", he said: "Danbury, Connecticut can eat my whole ass."

> On the 21st anniversary of the Baltic Way, some 50,000 people are expected to form a human chain from Vilnius to the Belarusian border to express solidarity with protests in the neighbouring country. On August 23, 1989, over a million people formed a human chain spanning Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to demand an end to the Soviet occupation. On Sunday, the Freedom Way will stretch 32 kilometres from Cathedral Square in central Vilnius to Medininkai, a town close to the Belarusian border.

## University forces professor to change syllabus that threatened to dismiss students who argue against BLM, abortion or same-sex marriage

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/Typhun` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ifc5ts/university_forces_professor_to_change_syllabus/):

> I had to take a critical thinking/writing course in college. Our first homework assignment was to figure out what topics we'd be arguing for in all of our papers for the semester and submit those topics to the professor, as well as our political leanings for a paper and later debate. So we write papers in favor of our views. Then he surprised us in the second half of the semester. We had to write papers supporting the contrasting viewpoints.
> 
> For the final exam, it was a classroom debate and we had to again argue against our viewpoints. I came from a conservative household and because my parents identified as conservative, I too identified that way (though socially liberal).  I had to argue a liberal viewpoint in a classroom debate for my final exam, and our grades were based upon how well our team did. I didn't trust my team because a bunch were slackers/idiots, so I went in more prepared. And in preparing myself for the debate and responding to the conservative arguments the other team offered, I found myself reevaluating my political ideology. I may not have done that myself if I had not been presented the challenge by my professor.
> 
> College is for exposure to new and different ideas. That teacher should find a new profession because they aren't trying to help people grow or challenge those view points.

## Kellyanne Conway to leave the White House at the end of the month, citing the need to focus on her family

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house/2020/08/23/6c26e18a-e5a7-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html):

> Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Trump and one of his longest-serving aides, is leaving the White House at the end of the month. Conway outlasted many of her colleagues from the campaign and the White House to become one of Trump's longest-serving aides, proving herself to be a survivor in a workplace that has had historical levels of turnover. The Conways became an object of fascination as George Conway ramped up his criticism of the president in 2018 while Kellyanne Conway remained a top adviser to Trump.

> Guess her daughter's tweet about [seeking emancipation](https://twitter.com/claudiamconwayy/status/1297351852099502080) had an impact.
> 
> I think Kellyanne is a horrible human being, but it's good to see that she is putting her daughter first right now. Sad that it took such a [public cry](https://twitter.com/claudiamconwayy/status/1297352852021665792) from her daughter on twitter for her to do it though...
