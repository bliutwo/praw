> I hate it for everyone.
> 
> Vets who went over there and came back changed, some of whom had their friends literally die in their arms. The same vets who also missed many life events back home, and ones who would never come home.
> 
> The civilians in Afghanistan impacted by all of this, and the ones caught in the crossfire who paid for being in the wrong place at the wrong time with their life.
> 
> The interpreters who face harsh punishment if they cannot leave.
> 
> And the people of the United States, who could have benefited more from $2,400,000,000,000 spent domestically.
> 
> At the end of the day, it’s reprehensible that people damn well old enough to remember Vietnam let this go on as long as it did, just to line their pockets. We had to rip the band aid off sooner or later, but this entire debacle is the fault of each administration going back to George W. Bush.

## Moderna set to start human trials of experimental mRNA HIV vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/moderna-hiv-vaccine/):

> Moderna could start trials of its experimental mRNA HIV vaccine as early as 19 August, according to a new post from the firm on clinicaltrials. "Even as we have shown that our mRNA-based vaccine can prevent Covid-19, this has encouraged us to pursue more-ambitious development programs within our prophylactic vaccines modality. Today we are announcing three new vaccine programs addressing seasonal flu, HIV and the Nipah virus, some of which have eluded traditional vaccine efforts, and all of which we believe can be addressed with our mRNA technology." Now, the Moderna trial will explore how to deliver the eOD-GT8 60mer immunogen with Moderna's mRNA technology and investigate how to use mRNA to direct cells to make proteins that will elicit immune responses against HIV. The holy grail for HIV on the horizon?
