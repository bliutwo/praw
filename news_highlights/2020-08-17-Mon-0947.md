## Death Valley reaches 130 degrees, hottest temperature in U.S. in at least 107 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-valley-reaches-130-degrees-hottest-temperature-in-u-s-in-at-least-107-years-2020-08-16/):

> During the week the all-time record was set in 1913, while other sites were around 8 degrees above normal, the Death Valley readings were 18 degrees above normal. Because of these discrepancies, experts say the hottest temperature ever "Reliably" recorded on Earth is 129.2 degrees, from 2013 in Death Valley. Computer models project that heat index days above 100 degrees in Texas will triple from 40 days before the year 2000 to 130 days by the end of the 21st century.

## U.S. policy of expelling migrant children without an asylum interview challenged in class-action lawsuit

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawsuit-seeks-to-halt-u-s-policy-of-expelling-migrant-children-without-an-asylum-interview/):

> Advocacy groups on Friday mounted the first class-action court challenge against the Trump administration's unprecedented policy of expelling migrant children from the U.S. southern border without giving them an opportunity to seek humanitarian refuge. Friday's lawsuit is the first to ask the district court in Washington, D.C, to block the use of the public health order to expel minors and to certify all migrant children as class members in the case. The law, first enacted in the late 19th century and recodified during the 1940s, authorizes the surgeon general to bar the "Introduction of persons or property" posing the danger of introducing a communicable disease into the U.S. The groups argued that expelling unaccompanied migrant children violates a 2008 anti-trafficking statute that requires their prompt transfer to the refugee agency and protects them from expedited deportations, as well as laws that afford them access to humanitarian protections from deportation, like asylum.

## Google giving far-right users' data to law enforcement, documents reveal

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/17/google-giving-user-data-authorities-documents-reveal):

> Checking the documents against Google's platforms reveals that in some cases Google did not necessarily ban the users they reported to the authorities, and some still have accounts on YouTube, Gmail and other services. While many of the comments appear to threaten other users, law enforcement, or Google employees, and many of the users appear to share far right extremist ideologies, many of those users and their comments remain on Google's services. "Are they expecting law enforcement to do something, or is this just a way of covering themselves? Does Google see its responsibility as simply reporting this to law enforcement and moving on?" Hussein said.

`/u/dave7243` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ibdzom/google_giving_farright_users_data_to_law/):

> >On a now-deleted video on the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton by Canadian white nationalist, Stefan Molyneux (whose channel YouTube has now banned), the user wrote: “Hi guys, i need your help, i cant help but look at those shooters and think, that could be me. I watch Stefan, and black pilled and many others on the right. I think i should do the same thing they are doing.”
> 
> If this is the kind of things being relayed to they police, I'm ok with it. People saying that they want to or plan to kill people SHOULD be reported to the police. They political leanings are irrelevant, and those on the right should be just as concerned that people are grouping them together with these kinds of sentiments.

> Someone on NPR mentioned that the flu season might not be as bad as prior years because a lot of people are still staying home, wearing masks, and washing their hands like we're supposed to, so I guess that's some good news.
> 
> Although who knows, we can't even control Covid, and that's just a liberal hoax that'll be over by Easter...
