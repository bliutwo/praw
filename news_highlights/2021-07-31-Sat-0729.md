> All my coworkers are very conservative. Only about 1/5 of us got vaccinated before Delta hit.
> 
> This plague is in full effect now. They have parents in hospitals and I have a few returning teammates with long covid, who have to sit down every 30 minutes because they can’t breathe.
> 
> Last year, I always heard the rationalization “nobody I know on Facebook has gotten very sick”, but how foolish is it to wait till something effects your loved ones until you take it seriously? By definition, it’ll be too late then. It’s the exact same attitude our society fosters with conflating climate change and the weekly weather.
