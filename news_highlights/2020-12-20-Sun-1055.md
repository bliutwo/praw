## Chicago mayor says attempt to block video of raid on Anjanette Young's home 'a mistake'

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-mayor-says-attempt-block-video-raid-anjanette-young-s-n1251756):

> Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who ran for office on a platform of police reform and racial justice, said Friday that the city's attempt to prevent a local TV station from airing police video of a botched raid was "a mistake." Her announcement came as the city formally withdrew a motion to prevent the CBS affiliate in Chicago from airing the video of police raiding the wrong home and handcuffing resident, Anjanette Young, who was naked. The city also withdrew a motion for sanctions against Young's attorney, Keenan Saulter, who obtained the police body camera video of the botched raid through a federal court challenge.
