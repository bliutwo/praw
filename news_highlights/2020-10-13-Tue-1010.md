> Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, doubled down on his commitment to helping Americans combat the coronavirus pandemic. The country's top infectious disease expert said the Trump campaign should take down the political advertisement that featured him, saying he did not appreciate being "Put in a political context." Fauci reiterated to Smith that he did not consent to being featured in the Trump team's new ad. Smith asked Fauci for clarification when it came to science-based restrictions and shutting the country down. "We've got to convince Americans that public health measures do not mean shutting the country down," said Fauci.
