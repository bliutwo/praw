## Taylor Swift makes $13,000 donations to 2 moms on verge of eviction amid pandemic | "No one should have to feel the kind of stress that's been put on you," Swift wrote in a donation to a Michigan mother of four who has been out of work.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/taylor-swift-makes-13-000-donations-2-moms-verge-eviction-n1250589?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma):

> Taylor Swift made sizable donations to help two mothers pay their rent and other bills following a Washington Post story on unemployed Americans facing eviction amid the pandemic. The pop star, whose favorite number is 13, donated $13,000 each to GoFundMe campaigns to two mothers interviewed in the newspaper, Nikki Cornwell and Shelbie Selewski, who were scheduled for eviction hearings in January. "No one should have to feel the kind of stress that's been put on you," Swift wrote with her donation to Selewski.

`/u/teargasted` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ka0w3t/taylor_swift_makes_13000_donations_to_2_moms_on/):

> I really hate how the media spins this shit. Yes, Taylor Swift did a very good thing. The media needs to cover how this is fucked up public policy to begin with. We absolutely shouldn't be relying on private donations to prevent another massive homeless crisis during a PANDEMIC. If our government were functional, they would have already either waived or paid missed rent payments directly.

## Feds to investigate after a sheriff's deputy killed a Black man entering his own home in Columbus, Ohio

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/ATLCoyote` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k9ssdq/feds_to_investigate_after_a_sheriffs_deputy/):

> This  is another tragedy that sadly, looks highly suspicious. The victim was armed (lawful concealed carry  permit), but had just returned from Subway with a sandwich, he was not a  suspect in any criminal investigation and had no criminal record,  raising questions about why he was confronted in the first place. He was  shot and killed while entering his own home and found by his 5-year-old  brother and grandmother.
> 
> Naturally,  there is no body-cam footage or eyewitnesses, meaning the deputy can  tell whatever story he wants to avoid prosecution.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/12/honeybees-use-tools-dung-repels-giant-hornets/):

> In East Asia, honeybees must contend with never-ending attacks by a formidable foe: giant hornets. Understanding how the Vietnamese bee behavior repels hornet attacks could have applications for protecting honeybees in other countries, including the United States, Mattila says. Mattila and colleagues, who spent hundreds of hours observing bees at a Vietnamese apiary, found that honeybees began adding feces to their hive entrances after natural attacks by giant hornets.

## Rats besiege New York Chipotle, eating avocados and attacking staff

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/chipotle-rats-new-york-avocado):

> At first glance, it might sound like small potatoes compared to when the CDC had to warn against New York's cannibal rats during the pandemic. "It's pure chaos every time a rat appears," employee Melvin Paulino told the New York Post - speaking of the brazen behavior of the rats. The rats seem to have developed the same expensive taste for avocados as many New Yorkers - they liked them so much Chipotle eventually had to move the fruit to the freezer to keep the rats at bay.

`/u/habit_rat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k9xoo8/rats_besiege_new_york_chipotle_eating_avocados/):

> "I once saw a pack of wild dogs take over and successfully run a Wendy's!"
