## UK: Home of terminally ill medical cannabis patient who grew her own plants raided by police

Summary of [original article](https://leaderpost.com/cannabis-news/home-of-terminally-ill-medical-cannabis-patient-who-grew-her-own-plants-raided-by-police):

> A terminally ill medical cannabis patient in the U.K. has avoided jail after dozens of police raided her home and destroyed the plants she was growing for medicine. Lisa Middleton, 44, had five mature plants and a couple dozen seedlings planted when 10 police cars arrived at her home early on an April morning in 2018, reports Yorkshire Live. "What makes me really angry is the lack of time we have, the lack of empathy, of care," Hannah Deacon, mother of Alfie Dingley, the first patient in the U.K. to receive a permanent medical cannabis licence, said earlier this year.

> Police making sure this citizen lives out her final days in lots of pain. Well done cops! ðŸ™„
