## Portland prepares for 60th night of protests after police declare riot, use force the night prior

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/07/portland-prepares-for-60th-night-of-protests-after-police-declare-riot-use-force-the-night-prior.html):

> A crowd of about 1,000 gathered in downtown Portland late Sunday for the city's 60th night of consecutive protests against racism and police brutality after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd sparked a widespread movement two months ago. What started as a relatively calm night devolved as people in the crowd launched fireworks toward the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse and federal officers responded with gas and crowd-control munitions. Protesters toppled the fence in front of the courthouse earlier in the night after federal officers issued warnings about tampering with the fence.

> It’s a shame that all of this still goes on and instead of doing something about it, our elected politicians don’t do shit. We’re on day 60 for a reason. Do your jobs and acknowledge the problem.

## ProPublica posts NYPD records, bypassing judge's blockade

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/b58c024d68048781af36f2c631290779):

> NEW YORK - Days after a federal judge paused the public release of New York City police disciplinary records, a news website has published a database containing complaint information for thousands of officers. "The database gives the people of New York City a glimpse at how allegations involving police misconduct have been handled, and allows journalists and ordinary citizens alike to look more deeply at the records of particular officers." The organization said it requested officer misconduct complaints from the CCRB under the state's open records law and received them before the union's lawsuit was filed.

## Seattle police claimed protesters blocked way to dying man. In fact, miscommunication with Seattle Fire was problem.

Summary of [original article](https://www.kuow.org/stories/seattle-police-and-fire-confusion-slowed-response-to-chop-shooting-not-protesters):

> Rather, what slowed emergency responders from reaching Lorenzo Anderson was a miscommunication between Seattle Fire and Seattle Police. Dispatch calls show that police waited for fire staff to meet them at their location, while fire medics, per policy, waited for police elsewhere to clear the scene for them to move in. A spokesperson for Seattle Fire said when the "Scenes of violence" policy is in effect, Seattle Police responds to the scene and then notifies Seattle Fire when it is safe to respond in.

`/u/TheRealNeenja` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hyfdvw/seattle_police_claimed_protesters_blocked_way_to/):

> This article is written as if there was a general level of incompetence... But reading through the timeline it's very clear that both the EMTs and the Fire Department were 100% on the ball and quickly reacting to comply with every bit of instruction they received from SPD.
> 
> SPD were the only ones that kept mysteriously not showing up to appointed rendezvous points, and then changing to a new rendezvous point whenever questioned on it. 
> 
> Combined with the willful abandonment of the Capitol Hill zone in the first place against the orders of the police chief, I think this paints an alarming circumstantial case for intentional neglect.

## More federal officers deploying to Portland as protests gain momentum

Summary of [original article](https://www.opb.org/news/article/more-federal-officers-deploying-portland/):

> Bradley W. Parks/OPB. Several dozen additional out-of-town federal law enforcement officers are deploying to Portland as they look to make additional arrests in the coming days, while also shifting tactics from the use of tear gas, according to multiple federal law enforcement sources. Federal law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, and because they said the nature of the situation in Portland is a "Crisis" being watched and managed from the highest levels of the federal government. As of Tuesday there were 114 federal law enforcement officers in Portland "Protecting federal facilities" as part of an executive order President Trump signed in June, according to court documents.
