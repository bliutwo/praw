## The Museum of London Has Acquired That Giant 'Trump Baby' Balloon for Its Collection of Protest Art

Summary of [original article](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/1937805-1937805):

> Ahead of the inauguration of the US president-elect Joe Biden this week, the Museum of London has acquired a large balloon depicting an unflattering caricature of Donald Trump as a giant baby. The sneering inflatable Trump, who is depicted in a diaper and waving his cell phone around, was first flown over London's Parliament Square in 2018 to mark the then president's official visit to the UK. It has subsequently become a reoccurring emblem of dissent at anti-Trump protests around the US. The London museum first expressed interest in acquiring the balloon two years ago, and says it will conserve the object as part of its collection of protest ephemera, potentially displaying it in the museum's future new home in West Smithfield in "The coming years," according to an emailed statement. The team behind the so-called Trump Baby tells Artnet News that it donated the giant balloon to the museum, but it has kept a half-size version to continue to fly at other protests.

Summary of [original article](https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/FBI-moves-on-alleged-members-of-extremist-groups-15878582.php):

> WASHINGTON - A metal guitarist and the alleged leader of a Colorado paramilitary training group have been charged with allegedly taking part in the riot at the Capitol last week, as the FBI ratchets up its investigation into the role extremist groups played in storming the building. The Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and the Proud Boys, a male-chauvinist group with ties to white nationalism, have drawn particular attention from the FBI agents investigating the attack on Congress as they work to determine whether those groups organized or directed the violence. "All these extremist groups are being looked at in terms of their participation at the Capitol," Acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin said Friday.
