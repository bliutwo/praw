## Kyle Rittenhouse trial: MSNBC barred from court, producer followed jury bus

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-kenosha-pd-says-person-tried-to-photograph-jurors):

> KENOSHA, Wis. - The jury at Kyle Rittenhouse's murder trial deliberated for a third full day without reaching a verdict Thursday, while the judge banned MSNBC from the courthouse after a freelancer for the network was accused of following the jurors in their bus. Even as the jury weighed the evidence, two mistrial requests from the defense hung over the case, with the potential to upend the verdict if the panel were to convict Rittenhouse. After the jury departed, Rittenhouse attorney Mark Richards told the judge he feared that letting members take home instructions would lead to jurors looking things up in the dictionary or doing their own research.

> No matter your perspective on this trial, if this is true it is absolutely unacceptable to follow jury members home while deliberations are ongoing.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/18/zero-covid-experts-predict-rise-us-cases-winter):

> A steep rise in Covid-19 cases in Europe should serve as a warning that the US could also see significant increases in coronavirus cases this winter, particularly in the nation's colder regions, scientists say. "Reductions in cases and new infections and hospitalizations have stopped in the US and started to turn around." Already, more than 765,000 people in the US have died from Covid-19.IHME's worst-case scenario predicts hundreds of thousands more deaths, for more than 1m pandemic deaths by March 2022."Many countries in western Europe are even farther ahead of us in the sense that the numbers are going up quite quickly in the places like the Netherlands and Denmark, but also in Germany now and a number of other countries," said Murray.
