> I don't understand the people in this thread blaming her for taking 20 minutes to open the door, and accusing her of deleting evidence.       
>      
> This would be a good opportunity to tell everyone that clicking "delete" on your computer doesn't actually delete anything. It merely marks that space available for use. The data is still there, and can absolutely be recovered. Forensic computer analysis is a whole branch of forensic analysis.    
>     
> Spoofing or masking an IP address is elementary stuff, guys. If she didn't know how to hide an IP address, she surely didn't know how to truly delete data on her computer, and surely not in 20 minutes. Additionally, if her IP address was tracked down so easily, then she probably didn't care to hide anything in the first place.    
>      
> **And for those of you with hard-ons for the Constitution:** You are not required to open your door for a warrant. You can absolutely sit in your house and wait for them to break it down, and if it were me, that is what I would do. Why? Because it is my home, my property, my choice, and I don't have to open the door to police. Period. The 2nd Amendment grants you the right to own guns. The 4th grants you the right to refuse entry into your home. Your rights are your rights.         
>      
> Now you're thinking, well, if they break down the door, don't be mad when they point guns at you. False. The police should draw their guns when they believe there is a threat. Not only were there children present in the home, not only was the crime non-violent, but she willingly opened the door. There was no scenario where pointing their guns at these individuals wasn't going to draw criticism. Politically motivated warrants will get you politically charged blame. That's the name of the game.
