Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27Q33P?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=twitter):

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - Mental health and crisis workers in New York City will respond to emergency mental health calls instead of law enforcement under a pilot program announced on Tuesday, following months of protests around the country over police brutality. Currently, New York police officers and emergency medical technicians respond to nearly all 911 calls involving a mental health issue, regardless of whether there is a risk of violence. The city is modeling the trial after programs in other cities, including one in Eugene, Oregon, in which unarmed mental health professionals respond to mental health calls instead of the police.

> This all adds up to a lot of cops being dicks.

## The C.D.C. updates its findings: Mask-wearing protects you, not just those around you.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/world/covid-cdc-guidelines-masks.html):

> Breaking from its tentative recommendations on mask use thus far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday that using masks benefits wearers, which is a step beyond its previous declaration that said wearing masks would only protect those around them. The unequivocal statements are a departure from the agency's previous language, which suggested that "The latest science may convince" Americans to wear masks and that mask use could prevent an infected person from spreading the virus to others. The new document listed several studies that "Have confirmed the benefit of universal masking," as well as some observational studies that have given evidence of its usefulness, including an example of two masked hair stylists who had been experiencing symptoms but did not transmit the virus to any of their 67 masked clients who were later contacted.

`/u/The_Sign_of_Zeta` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jryf3d/the_cdc_updates_its_findings_maskwearing_protects/):

> I mean I thought that was known.  It wasn’t as effective as everyone wearing one, but the data has been there for a while to show that the amount of virus you are exposed to directly affects if you get the virus and how severe it is.

## In court moves, Britney Spears seeks freedom from father

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/britney-spears-seeks-freedom-from-father-685c547c55bebd617bd637e3fb55d64c):

> Tuesday afternoon, a Los Angeles judge will hear arguments on Spears' requests, the boldest of which would remove James Spears as co-conservator for what his daughter says is an unwillingness to share control of her more than $60 million in assets. James Spears first filed to have Wallet return as his co-conservator instead, but Wallet withdrew after Britney Spears objected. James Spears subsequently said he would work with the Bessemer Trust, but now Britney Spears is insisting that such an arrangement would be "Doomed to failure" and her father needs to be out entirely.

`/u/morecomplete` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jrq7zj/in_court_moves_britney_spears_seeks_freedom_from/):

> > Last year, Wallet stepped down, leaving James Spears entirely in charge. He soon temporarily stepped down as conservator of Spears’ person, citing health reasons, **but kept his role as conservator of her finances.**
> 
> So not healthy enough to control everything in her life, just her money. Got it.

## US-Mexico border: Bid to reunite migrant families finds 121 more separated children

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54891974):

> The hunt to reunite families separated under the Trump administration's "Zero tolerance" migration policy is looking for the parents of even more children, an email seen by NBC News says. The remaining children have now been released from federal institutions into the care of sponsors - usually relatives or family friends in the US. Dozens of the children are under the age of five. At the time, President Trump initially defended the practice, saying he "Didn't want" to take children from their parents, but "When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away".

`/u/charlieblue666` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jrrm43/usmexico_border_bid_to_reunite_migrant_families/):

> And still not a word of acknowledgement from this administration about what they've done to these kids and their families.  This is just evil and I'm ashamed that my country is responsible for it.

## Tom Metzger Dies at 82; Notorious KKK Boss, Supremacist Who Ran for Congress

Summary of [original article](https://timesofsandiego.com/life/2020/11/10/tom-metzger-dies-at-82-notorious-kkk-boss-supremacist-who-ran-for-congress/):

> Nick Martin, editor of The Informant, which covers hate and extremism in America, tweeted: "If David Duke is America's best-known white supremacist in the past 40 or so years, then Tom Metzger was arguably No. 2. His influence on organized racism in the US was large, and he even had sway with a number of young neo-Nazis in recent years." Metzger in 1980 won a three-man Democratic Party primary for Congress in San Diego's 43rd District, leading the party to disavow his candidacy and endorse his opponent, Republican Clair Burgener. Tammy Gillies, San Diego-based regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Times of San Diego: "A dark chapter of hate closes with the passing of Tom Metzger - a notorious figure who helped to poison the hearts and minds of others with his xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry. We can now relegate him to the dustbin of history and take a collective breath."
