## The wealthiest 10% of Americans own a record 89% of all U.S. stocks

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html):

> The wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high that highlights the stock market's role in increasing wealth inequality. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half - one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history - came from stocks. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled "The democratization" of stocks.

`/u/Myopic_Cat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/qamnvw/the_wealthiest_10_of_americans_own_a_record_89_of/):

> Well, that statistic isn't all that surprising considering that [the wealthiest 10% own 70% of the country's total wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States), and that the rich have a larger share of their wealth in investments (rather than e.g. real estate).

## Amazon's Jeff Bezos 'may have lied to Congress'

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58961836):

> On Monday, five members of the US House Judiciary Committee wrote to Amazon boss Andy Jassy, who succeeded Mr Bezos in July.They said "Credible reporting" by Reuters and recent articles in other news outlets "Directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives - including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos". Since 2019, the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating competition in digital markets, including how Amazon uses third party seller data from its platform, and whether the company unfairly favours its own products. The news agency alleged that, in India at least, Amazon had a secret policy of manipulating search results to favour Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods.

> Is lying to congress wrong?  Cause people do it all the time and pay no consequence.
