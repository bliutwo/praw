## Police Officer Who Resigned After Fatal Shootings Is Hired as Sheriff’s Deputy

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/us/wisconsin-deputy-sheriff-fatal-shootings.html):

> "While some have expressed concerns about Mr. Mensah's past uses of force, I assembled a team who exhaustively reviewed Mr. Mensah's previous work history," the Waukesha County sheriff, Eric Severson, said in the statement. Mr. Mensah, a Black officer who joined the Wauwatosa department in 2015, shot Mr. Cole, an armed Black teenager, in a mall parking lot on Feb. 2. In an interview with WISN 12, the local ABC News affiliate, Sheriff Severson said that he had not solicited an application from Mr. Mensah and that he had reviewed Mr. Mensah's record carefully.

> This is why they always resign when shit hits the fan. That way when the smoke clears they can get another job with a different department. I know of a cop who impregnated an underage girl, resigned and moved to a new jurisdiction, got in trouble with a couple other women/girls, resigned and took yet another job in another jurisdiction. 
> 
> If they quit, it's voluntary and doesn't go on record. They're free to remain officers until one time they go too far. It's frankly disgusting.

## Toyota slapped with $180 million fine for violating Clean Air Act — Prosecutors say Toyota failed to comply with the law for a decade

Summary of [original article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/toyota-slapped-with-180-million-fine-for-violating-clean-air-act/):

> Toyota has agreed to pay $180 million to settle claims that the company failed to comply with the US Clean Air Act for a decade. The DoJ says that Toyota conducted "Systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions." "Toyota's actions undermined EPA's self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants. Today, Toyota pays the price for its misconduct with a $180 million civil penalty and agreement to injunctive relief to ensure that its violations will not be repeated."

And then to come through and fucking nail the execution, earning all the credit and accolades due for saving the day.
