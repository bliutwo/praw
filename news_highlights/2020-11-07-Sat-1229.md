## Important Update: 2020 Election

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jo065n/important_update_2020_election/):

> We've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night! FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. We've got a crazy week ahead of us, but if we all work together, we can do our part to protect the 2020 election.

> A few facts for you all:
> 
> * Voter fraud is incredibly rare. The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of .0000007%.
> 
> * There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)
> 
> * Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail.

## Georgia poll worker in hiding after false claims online

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-georgia-media-social-media-elections-aa0f256ec21de96fd5a41da703c4b443):

> Richard Barron, the Fulton County elections director, said late Friday that the poll worker seen in the video was discarding paper instructions, not a ballot, which would have been much larger than the paper seen in the video. CLAIM: A video showing the ballot count in Fulton County, Georgia, shows fraud because a poll worker processing absentee ballots crumples one up. "It's been questioned whether the poll worker featured in the video was discarding one of those ballots. The answer is no, undeniably no," Barron told reporters at a Friday evening news conference at the Fulton County elections warehouse in Atlanta.

## Doctors fear more death as Dakotas experience virus 'sorrow'

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-virus-outbreak-sioux-falls-south-dakota-north-dakota-bbb7bf37db1fc9f87044a37338e3af91):

> SIOUX FALLS, S.D. - With coronavirus cases running rampant in the Dakotas and elected leaders refusing to forcefully intervene, the burden of pushing people to take the virus seriously has increasingly been put on the families of those killed. North Dakota reported 309 people died from COVID-19 in the last 30 days, more than all other periods combined. In South Dakota, Noem has cast doubt on whether wearing masks in public is effective, saying that she'll leave it up to the people to decide.
