> 
> >“I may yet have a few reasonably energetic and productive years remaining to me in which I may still make a truly substantive contribution to society. I believe that I have demonstrated that I deserve the chance to do so, and I appeal for your consideration and favorable action to allow me to begin a new life.”

> Damn. I can't imagine how this happens. And if these boys were left unsupervised by their parents, gained access to someone's gun, and are now being returned to their parents,  who is making sure that they are supervised? They don't belong in juvenile detention,  but clearly someone dropped the ball in keeping the gun, their sons, and this now deceased man all safe. I pray that DFACS is monitoring them and their parents.

The president saluted the Dodgers as "a lot more than a baseball club, they are a pillar of American culture." He also praised the team for using its stadium as a mass COVID-19 vaccination site. The Dodgers, who are in town for a four-game series with the Washington Nationals, said only members of the 2020 World Series team would attend, and Bauer didn't sign with the team until this year.
