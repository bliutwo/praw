## Man facing federal charges for threatening to kill Dr. Fauci, NIH Director Dr. Collins

Summary of [original article](https://wsiltv.com/2021/07/27/man-facing-federal-charges-for-threatening-to-kill-dr-fauci-nih-director-dr-collins/):

> A Maryland man is now facing federal charges after allegedly sending threatening emails to Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health. One of the emails threatened that Dr. Fauci and his family would be "Dragged into the street, beaten to death, and set on fire." On April 24, 2021 alone, seven threatening emails were sent from the encrypted account between 10:05 p.m. and 10:12 p.m. As detailed in the affidavit, also on April 24, 2021, just 30 minutes before the seven emails were sent, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins, received a total of four threatening emails from the same encrypted email address associated with Connally. According to the affidavit, Connally also used the mail.com account to communicate with another individual discussing Dr. Fauci and espousing views that Dr. Fauci was engaged in fraud regarding HIV and AIDS, which was also one of the topics of the first threatening email sent from the encrypted account to Dr. Fauci on December 28, 2020.

> Fauci has been head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for a long, long time. In fact, he is world renowned. Doesn't have to, of course, since he and his wife developed the treatments for HIV. He could retire easily. Thing is, he is very much a patriot and probably believes he is the right person at the right time to battle Covid. In fact, he is. With Fauci you know that you're going to get the no bullshit truth as he knows it at the time. To villify him is like killing the messenger. That's how stupid it is.

## China critic Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama violated stock disclosure law, sold Alibaba option

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/china-critic-sen-tommy-tuberville-of-alabama-violated-stock-act.html):

> Tuberville, a newly disclosed financial disclosure report reveals, failed as required by the STOCK Act to file disclosures of about 130 stock and stock options trades executed from January through May within a maximum 45-day window mandated by that law, which applies to members of Congress. Last year, federal prosecutors investigated stock sales, in advance of a coronavirus-fueled stock share price plunge, by and related to the Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. Sen. Jim Inhofe of R-Okla., Then-Sen Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga. and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Those probes ended without any charges being filed - but the investigations and details about the controversial trades were widely publicized at the time Tuberville was running for office. A Tuberville spokeswoman told CNBC that the former Auburn University coach had not even known about the individual stock and stock option trades first detailed Tuesday by Business Insider and that as a result also had not known they needed to be disclosed by the STOCK Act's deadline.

## Hobby Lobby’s $1.6 million Gilgamesh tablet has been forfeited to the U.S.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/hobby-lobbys-gilgamesh-tablet-has-been-forfeited-to-the-us-.html):

> A false provenance letter was used to sell the tablet several times before Hobby Lobby purchased the item from a London-based auction house in 2014. Hobby Lobby later agreed to the tablet's forfeiture based on its illegal importations to the U.S. in 2003 and 2014. "Forfeiture of the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet demonstrates the Department's continued commitment to eliminating smuggled cultural property from the U.S. art market," said Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney general, in a statement.

## Activision Blizzard employees to walk out over executive response to lawsuit

Summary of [original article](https://charlieintel.com/activision-blizzard-employees-to-walk-out-over-executive-response-to-lawsuit/117984/):

> The state of California filed the lawsuit on July 20, 2021 against Activision Blizzard for what they state is a work place environment that is sexist and discriminates against female employees on numerous occasions, further alleging sexual harassment incidents occurred at Blizzard.

Activision Blizzard statement also directly calls out California's lawsuit for bringing up the suicide of the female employee in the suit, stating its "Disgraceful," but didn't clarify the incident itself as alleged in the lawsuit.

`/u/LookHere_LOOK_LISTEN` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/osrygg/activision_blizzard_employees_to_walk_out_over/):

> Best time to do it too. Companies are so desperate to hire. 
> 
> The one thing that I vividly remember back in 2009, is that it wasn't the employers who were desperate about the employment situation during the recession. It was the people looking for jobs.
> 
> Employers loved every bit of it, because it gave them all the leverage.
> 
> Situation is completely flipped now. And it's funny.
