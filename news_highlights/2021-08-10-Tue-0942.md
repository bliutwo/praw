## Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for one week

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/tech/twitter-marjorie-taylor-greene/index.html):

> Twitter has suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for one week following another violation of the platform's rules, the company said Tuesday. Greene tweeted on Monday that the Food and Drug Administration "Should not approve the covid vaccines." She also claimed the vaccines were "Failing" and that they were ineffective at reducing the virus's spread. In response, Twitter labeled the tweet as misleading and prevented Greene from tweeting for one week. Twitter declined to say how many times Greene has violated the company's rules.

> Just deactivate her account indefinitely. She's not going to stop and each time you suspended it for a week she just screams and uses it to fundraise.

> Truth is a valid defense for a defamation case. So all Newsmax and OANN need to do is unequivocally prove the election was stolen from Donald Trump. I'm aware a pillow monger and an off-brand digital security company have been at this for months. So they just need to cough of the goods and the case can easily be dismissed.

> The wastewater in Houston is so full of covid matter that they can predict 2 weeks out that the curve is going to continue to grow exponentially.  The recent department of health broadcast stated very plainly that in a short time everyone will have had either covid or a vaccination, there will be very few that don't fit in either of those categories, or both.
