## Trump signs four executive orders after economic relief talks with Democrats collapsed

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/08/trump-executive-order-coronavirus/):

> President Trump on Saturday signed several executive orders that he said would provide economic relief to millions of Americans, moving forward after talks with Democrats faltered. One of the executive orders would aim to provide $400 in weekly unemployment aid for millions of Americans whose $600 in weekly benefits expired last month. Trump signed the orders during a press event in Bedminster, N.J. On Friday, Trump acknowledged that the executive orders could be controversial and prompt lawsuits.

`/u/ttuurrppiinn` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i66mfc/trump_signs_four_executive_orders_after_economic/):

> The legality of these orders is very dubious; I think they all have legal orders to stop them and eventually get struck down. However, I think Congress is now put in the position of looking like they're taking something away from the American people if they don't replicate these four measures in their own stimulus package ASAP.

## Thousands of bikers heading to South Dakota rally to be blocked at tribal land checkpoints

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/08/thousands-bikers-outh-dakota-rally-to-be-blocked-tribal-land-checkpoints):

> Thousands of bikers heading to South Dakota's 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally will not be allowed through Cheyenne River Sioux checkpoints, a spokesman for the Native American group said on Saturday. The clampdown comes as fears mount that mask-free bikers visiting Sturgis for the largest gathering of people since the start of the Covid-19 epidemic could spread the virus to tribal groups that are already experiencing a rise in cases. Sturgis mayor Mark Carstensen said throughout the pandemic, "The state of South Dakota has been the freedom state and the city of Sturgis has stayed true to that".

## A Supreme Court justice voted to let law grads forgo the bar exam. Among them: his daughter.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nola.com/news/courts/article_c265f7fe-d8df-11ea-9e9e-3769a9dcf83b.html):

> When Louisiana Supreme Court Justice John Weimer cast the clinching vote last month to give this year's crop of law school graduates a pass on the state bar exam, the relief was immediate for hundreds of grads - including Weimer's eldest daughter. "The July 22 Louisiana Supreme Court Announcement Regarding the 2020 Bar Examination addresses the factors which went into my decision about the bar examination," Weimer wrote. Geyh pointed instead to a Louisiana judicial canon that is specific to a judge's obligation to carry out administrative duties "Without bias or prejudice." He noted that law graduates - including Weimer's daughter - are under acute stress as they prepare for the bar exam.

> BYU student Chase Hiatt has filed a lawsuit against the university claiming the online education offered after March 13 was "Subpar" and not what he paid for.

BYU is not the only university to have a lawsuit brought against it over the unexpected transition to online classes.

## Joe Arpaio loses sheriffâ€™s race in 2nd failed comeback bid

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/7ee55d22b1ad5910bb42b64a78f714bf):

> In the Nov. 3 general election, Sheridan will face Democrat Paul Penzone, who unseated Arpaio four years ago. In the profiling case, both Arpaio and Sheridan were found in civil contempt of court for disobeying a 2011 court order to stop the sheriff's immigration patrols, leading to Arpaio's criminal contempt conviction in 2017. Sheridan, a 38-year veteran of the sheriff's office who retired after Arpaio was defeated in 2016, said he was unaware of the highly publicized court order and didn't run the unit that carried out the immigration patrols.

`/u/hellofemur` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i5xwon/joe_arpaio_loses_sheriffs_race_in_2nd_failed/):

> Well, yeah, he lost, but he lost in a squeaker 37%-36% to his former deputy chief, who is vowing to restore Arpaio's policies.   
> 
> So it's not like Republican voters in AZ have decided to stop being batshit crazy.
