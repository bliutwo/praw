> WASHINGTON - In early May 2018, after weeks of phone calls and private meetings, 11 of the president's most senior advisers were called to the White House Situation Room where they were asked, by a show-of-hands vote, to decide the fate of thousands of migrant parents and their children, according to two officials who were there. Those invited included Sessions, Nielsen, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and newly installed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to documents obtained by NBC News.Nielsen told those at the meeting that there were simply not enough resources at DHS, nor at the other agencies that would be involved, to be able to separate parents, prosecute them for crossing the border and return them to their children in a timely manner, according to the two officials who were present. According to an invitation list obtained by NBC News, those expected to be in attendance at the meeting included: Sessions, Nielsen, Miller, Pompeo, Azar, Under Secretary of Defense John Rood, then-White House chief of staff John Kelly, White House deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell, then-White House counsel Don McGahn, and Marc Short, who was then director of legislative affairs and is now chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.

## NAACP files lawsuit against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, alleging voter disenfranchisement

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/election-2020/naacp-files-lawsuit-against-postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-alleging-voter-disenfranchisement):

> The NAACP has filed a lawsuit against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, claiming that he is attempting to "Disenfranchise voters of color" amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Washington, D.C. District Court, asks the court to declare DeJoy's recent operational changes as "Invalid" and against the law as well prevent DeJoy from implementing further policy changes that were announced on July 10. "As the country faces an uphill battle against COVID-19 and systemic racism, we're witnessing a significant onslaught against our postal system at a time when prompt mail delivery matters more than ever, especially for voters of color," Derrick Johnson, the President and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement.

> What is their reason or justification for removing high speed sorters? If mailings are low then there must be an analysis to support that.  It does not save money to remove machines, it costs money.  Wait! Doesn't the post office get paid via postage stamps, when we return the ballot?

## Steve Bannon indicted in scheme to defraud donors to campaign pledging to build border wall

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-bannon-indicted-border-wall-fraud-donors/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=97691530):

> Washington - Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and money laundering Thursday, after federal prosecutors in New York announced that Bannon and three others were indicted for allegedly defrauding donors to a $25 million fundraising campaign to build a wall along the southern border. Mr. Trump distanced himself from Bannon on Thursday, telling reporters at the White House that "I haven't been dealing with him for a very long period of time." The president also said he disliked the private effort to fund construction of the border wall and believed "It was being done for showboating reasons." "Although We Build the Wall spent money on the construction of the border wall, hundreds of thousands of dollars were siphoned out of We Build the Wall for the personal use and benefit of Kolfage, Bannon, Badolato and Timothy Shea," federal prosecutors said.

## Two more San Antonio Postal Service machines set to be removed, even as Postmaster General vows no more changes before elections

Summary of [original article](https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Two-more-San-Antonio-Postal-Service-machines-set-15495702.php):

> The postmaster general ordered the removal of six mail sorting machines in San Antonio, two more than previously known to postal union leaders, who say cuts to the U.S. Postal Service are causing long delays in mail delivery. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, confirmed the removal of the machines Wednesday after touring the main San Antonio post office and speaking with Dennis Stasa, senior plant manager for the Postal Service's Rio Grande District. When asked whether the processing hub showed signs of disarray, such as backed-up mail, Castro said it was not a busy time of day and the operation "Looked orderly." But Carlos Barrios, clerk craft director at the plant, later said mail handlers were directed to remove large piles of mail before Castro's visit in an effort to deceive the congressman.

> “This mail has been sitting there for weeks and weeks out,” Barrios said. “So rather than show Castro when he comes in and he sees the cluster there, it’s best to not even have it there. So they moved it and they transported the majority of that to the north dock, where they were put on a trailer so they can be sent to Austin."

## Lyft will suspend service in California after ordered to classify drivers as employees

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/lyft-will-suspend-service-in-california-after-ordered-to-classify-drivers-as-employees.html?s=09):

> Uber had planned to continue operating its food delivery service in California even during the suspension period, an Uber executive told Eater last week. The injunction targets ride-hailing drivers, but scrutiny on food delivery services has already ramped up under AB5, with San Francisco's district attorney suing the app-based delivery service DoorDash for misclassifying workers. Still, a similar situation played out in Austin in 2016 when Uber and Lyft suspended service there over a new background check law they said would prolong their process of signing up drivers.

## US COVID-19 database reportedly returning to CDC control

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnet.com/health/us-covid-19-database-reportedly-returning-to-cdc-control/):

> The US Department of Health and Human Services will instruct hospitals to report key coronavirus statistics to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, reversing a Trump administration move from July that ordered hospitals to report data to a central database in Washington. The WSJ cites White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, who this week told hospital executives and government officials in Arkansas that the current framework for reporting new COVID-19 cases was "An interim system," and that data collection responsibilities would soon return to the CDC. "CDC is working with us right now to build a revolutionary new data system so it can be moved back to the CDC, and they can have that regular accountability with hospitals relevant to treatment and PPE," Birx reportedly said. Always consult a physician or other qualified health provider regarding any questions you may have about a medical condition or health objectives.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-teen-told-cut-his-locs-texas-school-wins-court-n1237095):

> A federal judge in Texas has blocked a school district from enforcing a dress code policy that prohibited a Black teenager from keeping his locs. Judge George C. Hanks Jr. of the U.S. District Court in Houston issued a preliminary injunction late Monday that will allow Kaden Bradford, 16, to start the school year with his locs and without being confined to in-school suspension. Prior to the court decision, the school district intended to confine Kaden to indefinite in-school suspension and exclude him from school activities, such as the band program, unless he cut his locs, Nelson said.
