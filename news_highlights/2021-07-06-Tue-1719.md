## Cleveland police officer who killed Tamir Rice sees latest appeal to get his job back denied by Ohio Supreme Court

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2021/07/cleveland-police-officer-who-killed-tamir-rice-sees-latest-appeal-to-get-his-job-back-denied-by-ohio-supreme-court.html):

> CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Ohio Supreme Court on Monday rejected the Cleveland police union's appeal of a lower court's ruling keeping in place the city's firing of Timothy Loehmann, the officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in November 2014.Four of the court's seven justices declined jurisdiction to review the 8th District Court of Appeals' March finding that the union failed to serve the attorneys for the city of Cleveland with court filings at it challenged an arbitrator's decision upholding Loehmann's firing. The city fired the then-rookie officer for lying on his job application to become a police officer. Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeff Follmer said the union is disappointed that none of the courts that rejected the appeal took up the merits of their argument that Loehmann's firing was too harsh a punishment.

## Spain says non-consensual sex is rape, toughens sexual violence laws

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-says-non-consensual-sex-is-rape-toughens-sexual-violence-laws-2021-07-06/):

> REUTERS/Susana Vera.MADRID, July 6 - The Spanish government approved a law on Tuesday to define all non-consensual sex as rape, part of a legislative overhaul that toughens penalties for sexual harassment and mandates more support systems for victims. It approved the bill five years after what became known as the 'wolf-pack' case, in which five men gang-raped an 18-year old woman at Pamplona's bull-running festival, causing public outrage and prompting calls to reform laws on sexual violence. Based around a "Yes means yes" model, which qualifies any non-consenting sex as rape, the law will bring Spain into line with 11 other European countries, including Sweden, Portugal and Britain, that use similar legal definitions.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/catholic-buildings-fundraising-residential-school-survivors-1.6090650):

> Catholic officials said in 2015 they could only fundraise a total of $3.9 million for residential school survivors, but efforts for Catholic cathedrals and other buildings across Canada reached nearly $300 million since November 2005, according to data gathered by CBC News. Following the discovery of more than 1,000 unmarked graves in Kamloops, B.C., the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada, Starr, survivors and others wanted the church to revive its efforts. In the landmark 2005 Indian Residential School Settlement agreement, one of the Catholic church's promises was to give "Best efforts" at fundraising $25 million for survivors.

> Honestly, if you support the Catholic Church, at this point, you are embracing the horrible atrocities they commit on a regular basis.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html):

> In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that "Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs."

The agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs.

> The thing I love the most about this is that someone took the time to spell out JEDI in a board meeting somewhere and people went along with it. Like, fuck yeah, Jedi's in the military. Who's going to fuck with that?
