## Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition material could spread like 'wildfire,' threaten fair trial, lawyers say

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-ghislaine-maxwell/ghislaine-maxwells-deposition-material-could-spread-like-wildfire-threaten-fair-trial-lawyers-say-idUSKBN25H023):

> NEW YORK - Ghislaine Maxwell's chance of a fair trial on criminal charges she aided Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls could be destroyed by substantial negative publicity if a deposition she gave four years ago were publicly released, her lawyers said. "If the unsealing order goes into effect, it will forever let the cat out of the bag," the lawyers said, warning that "Intimate, sensitive, and personal information" about Maxwell might "Spread like wildfire across the Internet." Lawyers for Maxwell disagree, saying her constitutional rights to remain silent and get a fair trial by an impartial jury outweigh any presumption of public access.
