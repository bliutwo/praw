> Why did no one from the animal rescue ever ask about how their foster dogs and cats were doing? No one was suspicious of her continuing to foster and adopt animal after animal? I don’t understand how this woman wasn’t caught earlier. 100 animals?? 
> 
> Did she never have company over? 100 of anything is a lot. But 100 dead animals? Probably pretty hard to miss, I’m assuming there was a smell too.

> We don’t know about this specific situation yet but it’s common for abusive and narcissistic people to wait until you’re trapped in a car with them and then UNLOAD on you. Just screaming as loud as they possibly can right next to your head. My mom did it to me several times.
> 
> I never jumped out of a car, but I won’t lie, I pictured myself doing it many times just because I couldn’t take the shrieking harpy next to me anymore.
> 
> Just for people picturing a teenager jumping out because her mom was scolding her about homework or something. It could have been a snap “I can’t take this bitch any more” action.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/07/rudy-giulianis-dc-law-license-is-suspended-.html):

> WASHINGTON - The District of Columbia's highest court on Wednesday suspended Rudy Giuliani from practicing law in Washington, pending a disciplinary proceeding in New York. Giuliani's license to practice law in New York was suspended June 25 in a ruling that cited his "False and misleading statements" about the election loss of former President Donald Trump. Giuliani's false statements about voting in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania - all states that Biden won - were cited in the scathing, 33-page suspension order issued by a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the First Judicial Department of New York state Supreme Court on June 25.
