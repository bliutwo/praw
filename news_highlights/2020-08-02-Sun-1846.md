> It's remarkable how often people who engage in illicit activities will post about it on social media. Sure, they often know better, but can't resist the strong temptation of telling others. Not a new thing, but the medium is different. Instead of bragging at a bar, they do it on-line now. Heck, some even go further and live-stream.
