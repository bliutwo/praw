## Decorated Afghan pilot who protected US airmen in hiding after Pentagon reverses approval to come to US.

Summary of [original article](https://www.stripes.com/decorated-afghan-pilot-who-protected-us-airmen-in-hiding-after-pentagon-reverses-approval-to-come-to-us-1.651338):

> In early October, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service and the Defense Department approved Maj. Mohammed Naiem Asadi's request to seek refuge in America, along with his wife and 4-year-old daughter, because they were in "Imminent danger of being killed by the Taliban," approval documents and emails shared with Stars and Stripes show. Asadi protected an American pilot who crashed his A-29 Super Tucano attack turboprop in northern Afghanistan this summer, said a letter of commendation signed by Air Force Capt. Robert V. Yost. Asadi applied to come to the U.S. under Significant Public Benefit Parole, a temporary status for noncitizens in need of protection.

> So he was told he could come to the usa and then it was withdrawn. 
> 
> Part of the reasoning is that he could be considered a deserter from the afghan military. Us officials didn't want to be seen as being a part of facilitating that. 
> 
> But he is under usa protection in afganistan and in hiding. It seems ridiculous he couldn't just come to the usa then because the usa sort of helped him deserve the afghan military anyway.

ST. LOUIS - A St. Louis couple facing felony charges for waving guns at racial injustice protesters who marched near their home allege in a lawsuit that a news photographer trespassed to capture an image of the confrontation. The McCloskeys allege that Greenblatt, UPI, and Redbubble are all profiting from "t-shirts, masks, and other items, and licensing use of photographs bearing Plaintiffs' likenesses, without obtaining Plaintiffs' consent."

> You'd think a couple of lawyers would be more respectful of copyright violations.

> LOS ANGELES - Alex Trebek, the beloved host of "Jeopardy!," has died after his open and public battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

"Jeopardy!" will air episodes hosted by Trebek through Christmas Day 2020.

> I highly recommend reading Trebek's memoir, which he wrote in quarantine and released this July
> 
> 
> He was so happy to have his two adult children at home with him throughout quarantine to spend the rest of his days with. He was also sure to say that while he'll be missed, no one could say he was "gone too soon". He was grateful for his long life, beautiful family and extremely successful career. He was ready to go and only clung on towards the end out of duty towards his wife

> Yep, I’ll be perfectly content if that’s how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love, my soul mate, and our two wonderful children nearby. I’ll sit there for a while and then maybe the four of us will go for a walk, each day trying to walk a little farther than the last. We’ll take things one step at a time, one day at a time. In fact, I think I’ll go sit in the swing for a bit right now. The weather is beautiful—the sun is shining into a mild, mild looking sky, and there’s not a cloud in sight.
