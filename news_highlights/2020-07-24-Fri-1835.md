> >Fauci called the politicization of the coronavirus, "a reflection of the divisiveness in our society at the political level."
> 
> This eloquently sums it up.
> 
> Edit: By leveraging all the blame to one side you are further politicizing the issue. While fundamentally you are right, the way to approach this is to make the blanket statement of stop politicizing. This levels the playing field. If you were already at that level then great! And if not then now you are and we can talk eye to eye.
> 
> The thing that makes Dr Fauci's statement eloquent is that all of this subtext is there. Those of you railing against the Right, even justifiably, are just adding to the division.

> ROMULUS, MI - A Delta Airlines flight departing from Detroit Metro Airport Thursday had to return to the gate after a pair of customers refused to wear a mask during the flight.

> As a Delta employee, we have been told that we can now blacklist any passengers who refused to wear masks.
> 
> I just want to add on that for any medical reason that you can’t wear masks onboard, we would advise you to get to the airport 2 hours earlier to get preflight consultation by STAT-md to receive medical clearance to fly without masks. It’s always about your safety 1st guys!

## No students in class until January? Yes, one N.J. union leader says in urging big delay.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/education/2020/07/no-students-in-class-until-january-yes-one-nj-union-leader-says-in-urging-big-delay.html):

> The local teachers' union president in Paterson says Gov. Phil Murphy should hold off on reopening school buildings until January, and possibly longer, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Opening schools in September will result in recurring shutdowns when students and staffers inevitably test positive for the coronavirus, McEntee said in arguing that all school districts, not just Paterson, should delay restarting classes. Murphy's spokesperson, Alyana Alfaro, did not directly address McEntee's request for a major delay in opening schools, but said the governor and the state education department "Have been in regular and near-daily communication with school administrators, unions, and parents as our state looks ahead to the 2020-2021 school year."

> It’s sure looking like no in person schooling for 2020-2021. The hard part is, the youngest students, let’s say K-2 or 3, how do you do online schooling for them? A lot of teachers I talk to think the youngest ones are going to need more guidance and support directly. I couldn’t imagine being a parent and plopping my kid down in front of a device for kindergarten, and then having to intervene to help them over and over because they haven’t a clue what to do.

## U.S. insurers explore officer coverage as police reform debate rages

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-police-insurance-focus/u-s-insurers-explore-officer-coverage-as-police-reform-debate-rages-idUSKCN24P1A8?il=0):

> U.S. insurers and brokers are starting to craft professional liability coverage for police officers, spurred on by signs that policymakers in some cities and states want to use a financial stick to curb police misconduct. Insurers could build on the handful of policies that already exist for police officers who become embroiled in police work while off duty, said Anne Marie Towle, an executive at broker Hylant Group Inc in Ohio, adding she believes the idea will become more mainstream. The bill faces stiff opposition from powerful police unions who say it would be costly for already-underpaid officers and make recruitment more difficult, but it underscores that the broader concept is starting to gain ground amid the raging debate on police reform.

`/u/Chubbyblerd` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hx0qb3/us_insurers_explore_officer_coverage_as_police/):

> Chicago has spent almost three quarters of a billion dollars dealing with police  misconduct. I could see how municipalities would embrace pushing some of that liability on individual officers.
