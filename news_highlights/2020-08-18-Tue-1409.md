> It's been about 5 months since schools closed down.  In that period, we've had a lot of arguing in this country about whether to reopen schools or not, all based on these high and mighty conceptual questions about liberty, public health, federalism, etc.  But it seems like nobody ever did the actual work of figuring out how to reopen schools safely, or teach kids from home if we need to.
> 
> And now, I worry, schools will mostly reopen for a few weeks and then close down again until 2021.

## Hiker survives being stranded for 14 days in Santa Fe National Forest

Summary of [original article](https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/hiker-survives-being-stranded-for-14-days-in-santa-fe-national-forest/):

> NEW MEXICO - If a father and his two kids had not heard a cry for help, and didn't give up when rescuers did, a hiker stranded in the Santa Fe National Forest for 14 days may have never made it out of the wilderness. Utsey said they had already hiked ten miles but his kids went up the slope with him because they wanted to help find the stranded hiker. Firefighters say the man was an experienced hiker; he is recovering at a Santa Fe hospital.

> So basically, if I'm understanding right:
> 
> * Man hikes with two kids, hears cry for help
> 
> * Scrambles down a steep hillside (with two children) to find stranded hiker
> 
> * Gives him food and water (hiker can't walk), hikes back to trailhead to call 911
> 
> * Rescuers arrive, man gives them GPS coordinates and go home
> 
> * Rescuers can't find man, give up searching
> 
> * Man sees this on TV at home that night, goes back out the next day, finds the man again
> 
> * Calls 911, this time personally leads rescuers to stranded hiker

## N.J. will sue U.S. Postal Service to protect vote-by-mail, attorney general says

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/business/2020/08/nj-will-sue-us-postal-service-to-protect-vote-by-mail-attorney-general-says.html):

> New Jersey will sue the U.S. Postal Service, the state attorney general announced Tuesday, over concerns President Donald Trump's administration is purposely crippling the agency ahead of a nationwide surge in mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic. Union officials who represent New Jersey postal workers have reported delivery delays and dramatic changes to operations, including reductions in overtime and mail machines being taken offline, and the postal service recently warned the state it couldn't guarantee all mail-in ballots would be delivered in time to be counted. "While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud," researchers at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University recently wrote.
