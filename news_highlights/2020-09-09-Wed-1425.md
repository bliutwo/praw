## Uighurs accuse China of mass detention, torture in landmark complaint

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uighurs-accuse-china-mass-detention-torture-landmark-complaint-n1239493):

> The broader allegations filed with the court, widely known as the ICC, are that the Chinese government enforced birth control and sterilization programs among the Uighur population, carried out mass surveillance and massacres inside Xinjiang, and coerced some individuals into becoming informants on Uighurs living overseas. While outside visitors, including journalists from media groups such as NBC News, have occasionally been permitted to enter Xinjiang under highly monitored conditions, there is a growing body of evidence - testimonies from nongovernmental organizations, congressional findings and multiple, credible news reports - that China has engaged in a massive program of detention, surveillance and social re-engineering efforts involving the Uighurs and other minorities. While countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have recently hardened their stance against Beijing more broadly, and moved to sanction China specifically for its treatment of the Uighur population, the process of legally holding the officials allegedly responsible to account had appeared insurmountable, given neither China nor the U.S. acknowledges the authority of the ICC.But the attorneys behind this recent effort are relying on a legal precedent created by the court last year, after a similar complaint involving members of the Rohingya Muslim minority who had fled oppression in their native country, Myanmar.

> As always, genocide denial will not be tolerated. Report any denial, justification, etc. of the genocide of Uyghurs in China. It is extraordinarily well-documented.

> I live on the Minnesota Iowa border and even most rural Minnesota folks that I live around wear a mask and adhere to the Guidelines. But I drove 20 miles down to the Hy-vee In Esterville, Iowa and all the workers had masks around their necks and maybe 1 or 2 older customers had masks on and that's it.

> I feel like retailers have already been doing this for years, now they’re just openly admitting it. Aside from a handful of doorbusters I’ve noticed most Black Friday “discounts” seemed to carry through to Christmas.

## Coronavirus Tests Are Supposed to Be Free. The Surprise Bills Come Anyway.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-test-fees.html):

> One mother in California was surprised that her daughter's coronavirus test was fully covered but that a $49 "After hours" fee was not - the clinic said it provided tests only in the evening, so as to not infect other patients. The rules around the other tests are less clear: The law states that insurers must cover services related to obtaining a coronavirus test but doesn't identify what type of care makes the cut. Patients at a drive-through coronavirus testing site in Texas, for example, were unknowingly tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

> If he's racist and deliberately damages people's property, what business does he have in being a police officer? We need fewer assholes in our police forces, not more. Which part of zero tolerance means "come back after 30 days"? They _should_ be held to a higher standard, not a lower one.
