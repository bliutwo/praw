> Ugh. I don’t mean to put human emotions on this but... ugh.

## Target joins Walmart in staying closed for Thanksgiving this year

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/target-joins-walmart-in-staying-closed-for-thanksgiving-this-year.html):

> Instead, Target is encouraging shoppers to start their holiday shopping even earlier, in October. Adding to the uncertainty, Amazon has delayed its annual Prime Day shopping event, which is normally in July, to "Later than usual" this year. The delayed timing of Amazon's Prime Day will likely put additional pressure on retailers to start their deals even earlier, in a bid to compete.

## Man accused of running over Sikh man charged with hate crime

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/man-accused-running-over-sikh-man-charged-hate-crime-n1234803):

> A man accused of running over the Sikh owner of a suburban Denver liquor store after reportedly telling him and his wife to "Go back to your country" is now facing a hate crime charge in addition to 16 other charges, including attempted murder. Prosecutors said the hate crime charge was filed against Eric Breemen on Tuesday nearly three months after the alleged assault in the parking lot of the Lakewood store Lakhwant Singh owns with his wife, The charges came after an investigation prosecutors say was delayed by the severity of Singh's injuries, his 65-day stay in the hospital and coronavirus pandemic restrictions. According to the Sikh Coalition, a civil rights organization that fights discrimination against Sikhs and represents Singh, Breemen began picking up items in an agitated manner after entering Two Angels Liquors before harassing Singh and his wife, telling them to "Go back to your country," and damaging numerous items in the store.

`/u/Mist_Rising` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hywcpa/man_accused_of_running_over_sikh_man_charged_with/):

> Sikhs have to be the most incorrectly targeted group. Nobody attacks a sihk for being a sihk, they do it for being Muslim. Its like attacking a Hindu for being a Catholic, doesn't make sense. All because Shia Muslims wear turbans, and sihks wear turbans.
