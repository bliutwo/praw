> I don't know about you guys but I encourage that we raise awareness to things like this. I strongly believe that events like this can set a healthy precedent as long as we remain vigilant. The more people that see stuff like this, the higher chances of an officer or someone involved with their PD seeing this and learn from it.

## B.C. boy permanently brain damaged after eating lettuce contaminated with E. coli

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/marketplace-lettuce-contamination-1.5952161):

> The vast majority of the romaine eaten in North America comes from lettuce grown in areas of California such as the Salinas Valley, or Yuma, Ariz. Many of those romaine lettuce fields have cattle nearby. One head of E. coli-contaminated lettuce can be cut, processed, mixed with other lettuce, and then cross-contaminate many different packages of bagged salads. "The E. coli outbreaks linked to romaine lettuce and other leafy greens blew up in the last decade and a half because we wanted bagged salads," he said.

> This is one of the saddest things I’ve ever read. Your perfectly happy and healthy two year old losing the ability to walk or talk for the rest of their lives from eating lettuce. Ugh.

## SF poop-testing startup, once compared to Theranos, charged in $60M fraud scheme

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/ubiome-richman-apte-sec-filing-charges-fraud-16042042.php):

> Zachary Schulz Apte and Jessica Sunshine Richman, co-founders of defunct microbiome testing company uBiome, are accused of bilking their investors and health insurance providers, federal prosecutors said. In May, the FBI raided their San Francisco offices and uBiome suspended all testing and put the pair on administrative leave. The couple "Painted a false picture of uBiome as a rapidly growing company with a strong track record of reliable revenue through health insurance reimbursements for its tests. UBiome's purported success in generating revenue was a sham," the SEC wrote in a complaint.

## North Korea’s ‘only openly gay defector’ finds love

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56323825):

> Jang Yeong-jin's remarkable story as North Korea's only openly gay defector was covered by the international media after he published his autobiography. Jang began to realise he had only one option left - to leave North Korea altogether. Then in the spring of 1998, 13 months after he first arrived in South Korea, Jang opened a magazine to read the write-up of an interview he had given about his defection across the DMZ. He turned the page to discover an article about gay men coming out, with a scene from an American film showing two men kissing in bed.

> My god, this guy has gone through hospitalisation due to his sexuality, crawled through a minefield, cheated out of $84k, hospitalised again due to stress and eventually became homeless *and he still got up and rebuilt his life!*
> 
> What an inspiration!

## Russian pleads guilty to Tesla ransomware plot

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56469475):

> Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov is accused of offering an employee $1m to place ransomware in the computer network of the company's battery plant in Nevada. "The swift response of the company and the FBI prevented a major exfiltration of the victim company's data and stopped the extortion scheme at its inception," Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas McQuaid said in a statement. After the employee told Tesla about the plan, the company contacted the FBI who instructed the employee to record their conversations with Mr Kruichokov.

`/u/ImpecableCoward` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/m9wl57/russian_pleads_guilty_to_tesla_ransomware_plot/):

> Why would prosecutors make a deal and only give him 10 months if they already had all the proof necessary, including recording?
