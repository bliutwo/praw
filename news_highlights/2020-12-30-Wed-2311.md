Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/black-man-wrongfully-detained-maskless-police-officer-tests/story?id=74967778):

> "You're going to do this in public, make me walk outside in front of my family?" Mackey told the sergeant, who proceeded to grab onto Mackey's arm and lead him through the crowded food court and out the front door, where they were met by other police officers, who were also not wearing masks. After getting on his radio, the sergeant told Mackey that he was indeed the wrong man but briefly kept Mackey in handcuffs while saying "Give me one minute" to explain. Mackey demanded the handcuffs be removed immediately and the sergeant complied, telling Mackey that he matched the description of a credit card fraud suspect with dreadlocks and dressed all in black.

> Fire the officer. Shouldn't even be a question at this point. If the government wants to start de-escalating tensions between communities and the police, they need to work extra hard to get rid of the especially aggregious cops.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hunter-charged-homicide-death-pennsylvania-teen-shot-while-watching-sunset-n1252560):

> A hunter was charged with homicide in the death of an 18-year-old boy who was shot and killed in his car while watching the sunset at a Pennsylvania state park. Weintraub did not explain the details of Heller's deal but said that Heller has agreed to plead guilty to all the charges against him at his formal arraignment in April. Investigators narrowed suspects down to Heller based on vehicles seen entering and leaving the park at the time of Kutt's death, and Heller was in fact that hunter seen by Kutt's girlfriend, Weintraub said.

> He’s remorseful in the fact he got caught.
