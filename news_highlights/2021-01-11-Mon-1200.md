> The sane Republicans should get behind this hard. If they can impeach him then he can't run for president again. That would remove a lot of his post presidential hold over the party. I still believe there are a majority of republicans that went along with the craziness to keep power and this is their chance to be done with Trump before he drags the whole party down with him.

In the image, Rocky Mount Police Sgt. T.J. Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker stand before a statue of John Stark, a Revolutionary War officer from New Hampshire.

> 
> This man gave explicit support for the rioters and doubled down after being called out. Not even a pitiful fake 'I condemn all violence' statement. How many red flags was this guy throwing before the riots I wonder?

Summary of [original article](https://www.stripes.com/news/veterans/national-veterans-groups-plan-to-purge-members-found-guilty-in-capitol-attack-1.658114):

> WASHINGTON - Multiple veterans and service members are being investigated for their roles in the mob takeover of the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday, and at least two national veterans organizations want to ensure they're not on their membership lists. Disabled American Veterans, which has 1 million members nationwide, condemned the riots Saturday and announced its intent to remove any members found guilty in the attack. "[W]e are saddened that any veteran would desecrate our nation's capital and will take immediate action to initiate the removal of any DAV member found guilty of committing illegal acts against our nation," said Butch Whitehead, national commander of DAV. "Such behavior is a disgrace to our national values and must not be tolerated."

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fbi-visited-extremists-ahead-of-capitol-riots-urged-them-not-to-travel-to-dc-source):

> WASHINGTON D.C. - The FBI visited extremists prior to the pro-Trump rally and the deadly Capitol riot last week and urged them not to travel to Washington, D.C., a source familiar with the situation told Fox News. Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, sending Congress into recess and the Capitol building into lockdown as members attempted to certify the results of the presidential election in favor of President-elect Joe Biden. Washington police said the riot at the Capitol resulted in five deaths - including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot inside the building - and at least 70 arrests.

## Backup Was Denied - Former Capitol Police Chief Sund Says

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/backup-was-denied-former-capitol-police-chief-says/):

> WASHINGTON - Two days before Congress was set to formalize President-elect Joe Biden's victory, Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund was growing worried about the size of the pro-Trump crowds expected to stream into the District of Columbia in protest. In his first interview since pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week, Sund, who has since resigned, said his supervisors were reluctant to take formal steps to put the Guard on call even as police intelligence suggested that the crowd President Donald Trump had invited to Washington to protest his defeat probably would be much larger than earlier demonstrations. Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger suggested that Sund informally seek his Guard contacts, asking them to "Lean forward" and be on alert in case Capitol Police needed their help.

Two days later, on Wednesday afternoon, his forces in  the midst of crisis, Sund said he pleaded for help five more times as a  scene far more dire than he had ever imagined unfolded on the historic  Capitol grounds.

> This is exactly as bad as it seems.
