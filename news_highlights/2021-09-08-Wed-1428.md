## Texas Workers Are Dying In The Summer Heat, And Companies Aren’t Being Held Accountable

Summary of [original article](https://www.kut.org/texas/2021-09-08/texas-workers-are-dying-in-the-summer-heat-and-companies-arent-being-held-accountable):

> He is one of 53 workers who have succumbed to the brutal Texas heat since 2010, according to an investigation by Columbia Journalism Investigations, National Public Radio and The Texas Newsroom, a collaboration among Texas public radio stations and NPR. An analysis of federal data on worker heat deaths shows the state's tally has nearly doubled in the last 10 years compared to the previous decade; experts say the number of deaths reflected in the data almost certainly is an undercount. OSHA cited Hellas for two violations in connection with Simmons's death and proposed a fine of $14,782 - about $3,000 more than the average for a worker heat death in Texas. Under a settlement agreement, Republic Services promised to train workers on first aid, hire a consultant to evaluate the company's heat-safety protocols and periodically observe workers on routes to make sure updated policies were being followed.

## Virginia takes down Robert E Lee statue from state capital Richmond

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/08/robert-e-lee-statue-confederate-general-richmond-virginia):

> A towering bronze depiction of General Robert E Lee - one of the largest Confederate statues in the US - has been removed from its pedestal in Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy. The 21ft statue of Lee on a horse had topped a huge granite base twice as tall as that in a prominent residential boulevard named Monument Avenue for more than 130 years. After years of resistance and a long court battle, Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, ordered the statue taken down last summer, citing the pain felt across the country over the death of Floyd.
