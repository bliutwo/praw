## Georgia high court rejects latest Trump election appeal

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-georgia-elections-electoral-college-3e59015ec63cfd38920380248ae7caad):

> ATLANTA - President Donald Trump has lost his latest legal challenge seeking to overturn Georgia's election results, with the state Supreme Court's rejection late Saturday of a case from Trump's campaign and Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Shafer. On Friday the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit backed by Trump seeking to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's election victory, a move that ended a desperate attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation's highest court. Last week, Raffensberger again recertified the state's election results after a recount requested by Trump confirmed once again that Biden won the state, and the governor then recertified the state's 16 presidential electors.
