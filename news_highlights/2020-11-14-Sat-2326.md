## Federal judge rules acting DHS head Chad Wolf unlawfully appointed, invalidates DACA suspension

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-judge-rules-acting-dhs-head-chad-wolf-unlawfully-appointed-n1247848):

> A federal judge in New York City on Saturday said Chad Wolf has not been acting lawfully as the chief of Homeland Security and that, as such, his suspension of protections for a class of migrants brought to the United States illegally as children is invalid. He concluded, "Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the HSA when he issued the Wolf Memorandum" that suspended DACA.Karen Tumlin, a lawyer in the case and director of the Los Angeles-based Justice Action Center, said the ruling means, "The effort in the Wolf memo to gut the DACA program is overturned." Although President Donald Trump formally nominated Wolf for the job in summer, Wolf has yet to get a full vote in the Senate, keeping his role as "Acting." Garaufis cited the Government Accountability Office, which wrote in a report to Congress in August that Wolf was the beneficiary of an "Invalid order of succession."

> This is the third judge to rule that Chad Wolf was appointed unlawfully. The reason why his appointment was unlawful is a comedy of fuckups. Here's a brief summary of it all.
> 
> 1. In April 2019, Kirstjen Nielsen decides to step down. They want to have CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan take over. In order to do that, Nielsen has the DHS General Counsel, John Mitnick, draft a memo that will amend the DHS Order of Succession to make CBP Commissioner to be next in line. He writes a memo saying "Sign this and it will do what you asked." She signs it, then she resigns and Kevin McAleenan becomes Acting Secretary. Mitnick is later fired and replaced with Chad Mizelle, a 33-year-old baby-faced lawyer with little experience who's a close ally of Stephen Miller.
> 
> 2. Months later, someone at DHS looks at the memo that General Counsel Mitnick wrote and realizes there's a problem. It turns out he fucked up (or he didn't notice a fuckup). What Nielsen signed was a memo changing the Order of Succession *in case of natural disaster or other emergency,* and *not* the Order of Succession in case of resignation—which is what she did. They do not make this error public. But importantly, the error means that Kevin McAleenan was probably not lawfully Acting Secretary.
> 
> 3. In November 2019, Kevin McAleenan is done as Acting Secretary. This time, the DHS General Counsel writes a new memo that explicitly changes the Order of Succession in case of resignation, to allow Chad Wolf, the newly-Senate-Confirmed head of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans, to take over. Wolf is Kirstjen Nielsen's former Chief of Staff and was reportedly chosen because even Stephen Miller knew putting Ken Cuccinelli in control would not have been legal or acceptable. BUT—since Kevin McAleenan was not lawfully the Acting Secretary, he didn't have authority to amend the DHS Order of Succession to make Chad Wolf the Acting Secretary.
> 
> 3. After Wolf takes over, the April 2019 memo fuckup is discovered by a member of Congress and made public. It quickly makes its way into lawsuits, and over the past two months, three separate courts have ruled that he was appointed unlawfully and struck down policies he signed off on.

> "He misses his mom since he was a mama's boy," his grandmother, Rozie Salinas, told NBC News on Saturday. "I mean, what do I tell him?
