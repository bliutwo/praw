> “The family is only the second confirmed wolf pack in California in the past 100 years, and was first identified in 2017. Wolves have been hunted since white settlers moved into western states but endangered species laws and conservation efforts have helped a slow recovery.
> 
> “The Trump administration, however, has proposed stripping protections from wolves across the US. While California state law protects the wolves, neighbouring states such as Oregon do not have such safeguards.”

## Target joins Walmart in staying closed for Thanksgiving this year

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/target-joins-walmart-in-staying-closed-for-thanksgiving-this-year.html):

> Instead, Target is encouraging shoppers to start their holiday shopping even earlier, in October. Adding to the uncertainty, Amazon has delayed its annual Prime Day shopping event, which is normally in July, to "Later than usual" this year. The delayed timing of Amazon's Prime Day will likely put additional pressure on retailers to start their deals even earlier, in a bid to compete.

## Man accused of running over Sikh man charged with hate crime

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/man-accused-running-over-sikh-man-charged-hate-crime-n1234803):

> A man accused of running over the Sikh owner of a suburban Denver liquor store after reportedly telling him and his wife to "Go back to your country" is now facing a hate crime charge in addition to 16 other charges, including attempted murder. Prosecutors said the hate crime charge was filed against Eric Breemen on Tuesday nearly three months after the alleged assault in the parking lot of the Lakewood store Lakhwant Singh owns with his wife, The charges came after an investigation prosecutors say was delayed by the severity of Singh's injuries, his 65-day stay in the hospital and coronavirus pandemic restrictions. According to the Sikh Coalition, a civil rights organization that fights discrimination against Sikhs and represents Singh, Breemen began picking up items in an agitated manner after entering Two Angels Liquors before harassing Singh and his wife, telling them to "Go back to your country," and damaging numerous items in the store.

`/u/Mist_Rising` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hywcpa/man_accused_of_running_over_sikh_man_charged_with/):

> Sikhs have to be the most incorrectly targeted group. Nobody attacks a sihk for being a sihk, they do it for being Muslim. Its like attacking a Hindu for being a Catholic, doesn't make sense. All because Shia Muslims wear turbans, and sihks wear turbans.

## Tennessee Attorney General finds mask mandates constitutional

Summary of [original article](https://www.thecentersquare.com/tennessee/tennessee-attorney-general-finds-mask-mandates-constitutional/article_29a54356-ce82-11ea-bc59-6b0c4e45f62a.html):

> Tennessee's Attorney General has issued an opinion that mandates requiring citizens to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is constitutionally defensible. The opinion addresses whether mask mandates infringe on constitutional right to liberty and freedom of speech, and whether local governments have authority to issue such mandates. On infringement of constitutional rights, Slatery opined that mandating facial coverings do not "Impermissibly infringe on a person's constitutional right to liberty or freedom of speech." Citing legal challenges to Tennessee's seat belt law and motorcycle helmet laws, in which courts found that such laws do not violate constitutional prohibitions against taking liberty without due process, Slatery found that similar challenges against mask mandates would likely not be successful.

`/u/disequilibrium0` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hyv9kk/tennessee_attorney_general_finds_mask_mandates/):

> From the opinion: "Even though some may be unconvinced that wearing face coverings is an effective way to thwart the spread of COVID-19, courts may not second-guess governmental officials when the measures they enact in response to a public health emergency are not arbitrary or unreasonable."
