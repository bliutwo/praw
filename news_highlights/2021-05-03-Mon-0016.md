> Dozens of babies with spina bifida have been spared from paralysis after having surgery while still in the womb. The intricate surgery, which can take a team of up to 30 doctors to carry out, has been carried out on 32 babies in the womb since January 2020, NHS England has said. Helena Purcell's unborn baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and was operated on when she was 23 weeks pregnant.

> Glad to see the tech has progressed. I was born with it and was extremely lucky to have a corrective surgery (after birth) that prevented any future problems. From what I understand, something like 10-15% of spina bifida occulta patients were successfully treated with corrective surgery at that time in the early 90s.

## Missouri Legislature Expels Rep. Rick Roeber Over Child Abuse Allegations

Summary of [original article](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2021-04-21/missouri-legislature-expels-rep-rick-roeber-over-child-abuse-allegations):

> Months after child abuse allegations first surfaced against state Rep. Rick Roeber - then a candidate for the Lee's Summit district - the Missouri House of Representatives voted Wednesday to expel the Republican. In a somber discussion on the House floor, lawmakers said they found the allegations credible and criticized prosecutors for not bringing charges against Roeber when the abuse was reported decades ago. The abuse allegations were first reported by the Kansas City Star's editorial board in late September when Roeber was running for the seat held by his late wife, Rebecca Roeber.
