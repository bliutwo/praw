> "The grand jury didn’t agree certain actions were justified, nor did it decide the indictment should be the only charges in the Breonna Taylor case. The grand jury was not given the opportunity to deliberate on those charges"
> 
> That does not corroborate the AG’s statements.

## Lawyers say they can't find the parents of 545 migrant children separated by Trump administration

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1244066?__twitter_impression=true&s=09):

> Oct. 20, 2020, 6:22 PM EDT. WASHINGTON - Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children, and that approximately two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing from the ACLU on Tuesday. Unlike the 2,800 families separated under zero tolerance in 2018, most of whom remained in custody when zero tolerance was ended by executive order, many of the more than 1,000 parents separated from their children under the pilot program had already been deported before a federal judge in California ordered they be found. A separate court order directed that the Trump administration reunite families separated under zero tolerance in 2018.DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

## Officials find human remains during a test excavation in the search for possible graves from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newson6.com/story/5f8f3c9d9deb8e0bea6e6588/officials-find-human-remains-during-test-excavation-):

> Officials said they have encountered human remains during a test excavation in the search for possible graves from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This is the first time remains have been found in this search, and archaeologists said it's still too soon to know if the remains are connected to the massacre. More than a year after the Oklahoma Archeological Survey started its work at Oaklawn Cemetery in the search for race massacre victims, the team found human remains.

`/u/EeezyMac` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jex0mf/officials_find_human_remains_during_a_test/):

> Prior to a couple of years ago, I had never even heard of the Tulsa Massacre. It needs to be taught in schools all across America. We have to acknowledge our faults and terrible deeds if we want to move forward as a society, but of course the government doesn't want us to know all their dirty secrets.

## Tribes make new move to shut down Dakota Access Pipeline

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/dakota-access-pipeline-native-americans-courts-18291eae6f58715ba30b3bb77f05a5c7):

> BISMARCK, N.D. - Native American tribes opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline once again have asked a federal judge to stop the flow of oil while the legal battle over the line's future plays out. "The Tribes are irreparably harmed by the ongoing operation of the pipeline, through the exposure to catastrophic risk, through the ongoing trauma of the government's refusal to comply with the law, and through undermining the Tribes' sovereign governmental role to protect their members and respond to potential disasters," attorneys Jan Hasselman and Nicole Ducheneaux wrote in a Friday filing. Tribes are asking Boasberg to issue an injunction to shut down the pipeline while the legal fight plays out.

`/u/popecorkyxxiv` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jerk8u/tribes_make_new_move_to_shut_down_dakota_access/):

> It's the US so whichever side of the argument is worth the most money will win.
