## US consumer prices surge in June by the most since 2008

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/business-prices-consumer-prices-7c0dceffdbd50a8b1b888af5d3b922ed):

> Excluding volatile oil and gas prices, so-called core inflation rose 4.5% in the past year, the largest increase since November 1991.The pickup in inflation, which has coincided with the economy's rapid recovery from the pandemic recession, has heightened concerns that the Federal Reserve might feel compelled to begin withdrawing its low-interest rate policies earlier than expected. Investors have largely accepted the Fed's belief that higher inflation will be short-lived, with bond yields signaling that inflation concerns on Wall Street are fading. Bond investors now expect inflation to average 2.4% over the next five years, down from 2.7% in mid-May.Americans' longer-term views on inflation have also leveled off.

`/u/IntermittentDrops` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ojfs75/us_consumer_prices_surge_in_june_by_the_most/):

> Jan | 0.3%
> Feb | 0.4%
> Mar | 0.6%
> Apr | 0.8%
> May | 0.6%
> June | 0.9%
> 
> The sum is a **3.6%** increase and we are halfway through the year. The average monthly increase has been **0.6%**.
> 
> To keep inflation to only 3% this year we would need to *deflate* by 0.1% per month.
> 
> To keep inflation to only 4% this year we would need to slow to 0.067% per month.
> 
> **Continuing at a 0.6% pace, we would hit 7.2% inflation for the year.**

## American west stuck in cycle of ‘heat, drought and fire’, experts warn

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/12/wildfires-california-oregon-drought-heat-fire-cycle):

> As fires propagate throughout the US west on the heels of record heatwaves, experts are warning that the region is caught in a vicious feedback cycle of extreme heat, drought and fire, all amplified by the climate crisis. The Beckwourth Complex grew so fast and with such intensity that it whipped up a rare fire tornado - a swirling vortex of smoke and fire. "The fire behavior we are seeing on the Bootleg fire is among the most extreme you can find and firefighters are seeing conditions they have never seen before," Al Lawson, an incident commander for the Bootleg fire, said in a statement.

> See what you guys need is what we in the deep south call "humid as fuck".  You can't have a forest fire when the air itself is fucking water.

> Brad Schmidt - vice president for the Midwest region for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers which represents the workers - told The Wichita Eagle that the union was striking for better pay, better working conditions, and less mandatory overtime.
