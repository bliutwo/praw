## Suicide claimed more Japanese lives in October than 10 months of COVID

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japan-suicide-coronavirus-more-japanese-suicides-in-october-than-total-covid-deaths/):

> Tokyo - Far more Japanese people are dying of suicide, likely exacerbated by the economic and social repercussions of the pandemic, than of the COVID-19 disease itself. October self-inflicted deaths were up 600 year on year, with female suicides, about a third of the total, surging over 80%. Women, who have primary responsibility for childcare, have borne the brunt of pandemic-induced job losses and insecurity. Deteriorating mental health in Japan - which reports suicide data far more quickly than most countries - could prove to be a worrying harbinger of the pandemic's insidious impact elsewhere.

> This isn't a new thing and I'm glad they are tackling the issue. It's too bad it took a global pandemic to do it, but I hope they'll figure out a methodology that will lower the number

## Federal judge rules acting DHS head Chad Wolf unlawfully appointed, invalidates DACA suspension

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-judge-rules-acting-dhs-head-chad-wolf-unlawfully-appointed-n1247848):

> A federal judge in New York City on Saturday said Chad Wolf has not been acting lawfully as the chief of Homeland Security and that, as such, his suspension of protections for a class of migrants brought to the United States illegally as children is invalid. He concluded, "Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the HSA when he issued the Wolf Memorandum" that suspended DACA.Karen Tumlin, a lawyer in the case and director of the Los Angeles-based Justice Action Center, said the ruling means, "The effort in the Wolf memo to gut the DACA program is overturned." Although President Donald Trump formally nominated Wolf for the job in summer, Wolf has yet to get a full vote in the Senate, keeping his role as "Acting." Garaufis cited the Government Accountability Office, which wrote in a report to Congress in August that Wolf was the beneficiary of an "Invalid order of succession."

## BBC Investigation: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54874120):

> Checking Michigan state public records, cross-referencing voter postal codes, we were able to find precise dates of birth for those who had voted - and as we had anticipated, they failed to match the dates of birth on the death records. Local election officials told us that one of the votes had been counted but there was no record of the son having voted. So if you compare millions of voters in Michigan with a database of deaths across the United States you're bound to find cross-over, particularly if the voter database doesn't include the day of the month on which a person is born.

Summary of [original article](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2020/11/13/aclu-iowa-unions-file-covid-19-complaint-against-iowa-osha/6278068002/):

> The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and other groups filed a federal complaint against the state's Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Friday, saying regulators failed to protect workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. "This obviously undermines trust in Iowa OSHA that it's willing to be accountable for its own actions and its inactions," ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said Friday. In addition to the ACLU, organizations that signed the complaint include the Iowa Federation of Labor, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, the Indiana-Illinois-Iowa Foundation for Fair Contracting, the Iowa Immigrants' Rights Program, the Iowa State Building and Construction Trades Council, and Iowa Justice for Our Neighbors.

> The Iowa government was more interested in covering up covid and trying to pretend everything is fine than actually trying to stop it.
