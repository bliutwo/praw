> These politicians are part of the problem,  and I'm tired of people giving some of them a pass just for having a D next to their name.  
> Here in LA,  we had the infamous incident of our governor being caught dining maskless indoors after weeks of scolding tweets ordering us peasants to follow the rules.  Next,  a city supervisor declared outdoor dining so dangerous that it justified laying off thousands of workers without pay or aid.... and then went to celebrate her vote with dinner out.  
> 
> We already have a problem with people not taking these measures seriously. How the fuck do they expect people to make the huge sacrifices they're asking of us,  when they are themselves unwilling?
> 
> They want us to sacrifice our livelihoods, our children's education, our future,  our wellbeing, and even our HOMES. They can't be bothered to sacrifice their 300 dollar truffle pasta.  Fuck these boners. Vote them ALL out.

The U.S. labor regulator found Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave and terminated them for accessing documents related to how the company polices internal forums, according to the complaint. Google has until Dec. 16 to formally respond to the NLRB. The case, which could lead to reinstatement of fired workers and changes in company policies, is scheduled to be tried in front of an administrative law judge on April 12.
