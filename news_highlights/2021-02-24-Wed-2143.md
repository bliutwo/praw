## U.S. Supreme Court weighs scope of police power to enter homes without a warrant

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-police-idUSKBN2AO2NZ):

> 4 Min Read.WASHINGTON - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared reluctant to give police unlimited power to enter a home without a warrant when pursuing a suspect for a minor crime in a case involving a California driver tailed by an officer after honking his horn while listening to music. Lange then asked the Supreme Court to rule that police officers cannot evade the warrant requirement when chasing someone to their home when the underlying conduct constitutes a misdemeanor offense. A broad ruling in favor of police could further expand their powers by widening their ability to enter homes without a warrant after pursuing people suspected of misdemeanor offenses, not just felonies.

## 3 million Texans boil water amid 'plumbing catastrophe,' food shortages after devastating storm: "The water itself, it’s really coming out all yellow," said one San Antonio mom.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/8-million-texans-boiling-water-after-wintry-blast-n1258648):

> SAN ANTONIO - The number of Texans who were boiling their water to make it safe to drink plunged to 3 million Wednesday from 8 million the day before as platoons of plumbers and engineers worked around the clock to repair the countless homes and businesses damaged by a cruel winter storm. Still, the commission reported that considerable progress had been made since Saturday, when 1,445 public water systems reported service disruptions due to the cold, affecting 14.4 million Texans across 190 counties. "Nearly half of the residents in one of the largest states in the U.S. are experiencing a plumbing catastrophe due to burst pipes from freezing temperatures and significant power outages," said George Greene IV of Water Mission, a South Carolina-based Christian engineering organization that normally works in developing countries on safe water and sanitation community development projects, and responds to disasters where emergency safe water access is needed.

> >In tweets after the Capitol insurrection, Greene falsely suggested that those who had broken into the Capitol were not Republicans and instead falsely implied so-called "Antifa" dressed as Trump supporters were to blame.
> In fact, Anthony Aguero, a conservative livestreamer, activist and associate of Greene, said on video following the January 6 assault on the Capitol that he had been among those who entered and attacked those who falsely claimed it was done by "Antifa.""**We were all there. It was not Antifa and it was not BLM. It was Trump supporters that did that yesterday**. I'm the first to admit it, being one myself," said Aguero in a video posted on January 7.
> "I walked amongst all those people," he added, later defending entering the Capitol.
> 
> imagine melting your brain for years on right-wing propaganda, state gops are asking if youre ready to die for trump, culminating in storming the capitol to overthrow democracy at your idols request, only to have your friends who egged you on tell the public it was actually gay commie antifas that did it.

## Virginia prison staffer says she was fired on suspicion of smuggling after body scan detected tampon

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbc12.com/2021/02/24/virginia-prison-staffer-says-she-was-fired-suspicion-smuggling-after-body-scan-detected-tampon/):

> A dental hygienist who says she was fired by the Virginia Department of Corrections after a body scanner detected she was wearing a tampon can proceed with a sex discrimination lawsuit against the state, a federal judge ruled this week. The employee, Joyce Flores, alleged she was interrogated for hours at Augusta Correctional Center on suspicion she was smuggling contraband. The Virginia Mercury is a new, nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization covering Virginia government and policy.

`/u/witqueen` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lrctgr/virginia_prison_staffer_says_she_was_fired_on/):

> So they already knew this was an issue. The Virginia Department of Corrections drew a nationwide backlash in 2018 after it instituted a policy barring women from visiting prisons while wearing a tampon, citing the inability of new body-scanning technology used for screening visitors to differentiate feminine hygiene products from drugs and other contraband.
