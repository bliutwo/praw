> If the [FEDS are charging the Proud Boys](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/proud-boys-capitol-riot-terrorism-crimes/) and Oathkeepers with terrorism charges, and they can link Stone and Jones to them, then they are probably in serious trouble under current terrorism laws.   And Trump could very well be too.  Stand back and stand by!!!

## Federal judges call for increased security after threats jump 400% and one judge's son is killed

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/federal-judge-threats-attack-60-minutes-2021-02-21/?__twitter_impression=true):

> In the last five years, threats of federal judges have jumped 400% to more than 4,000 last year - many of them death threats, sometimes ending in violence. Last year, there were 4,200 threats against federal judges. Perhaps no judge in the country has felt the heat of online threats more than senior U.S. District Judge James Robart.

> > The shooter was Roy Den Hollander, a 72-year-old lawyer. He harbored deep hatred for women... The FBI discovered he had killed another lawyer a week before. Then he went hunting for Judge Salas.

> A terrible tragedy...

> > Esther Salas: He knew where obviously where I lived. He knew my routes to work. He knew the church we attended. He had Daniel's school. He knew baseball games. Just a complete work up on me and my family.
> > 
> > Esther Salas in YouTube video: We may not be able to stop something like this from happening again, but we can make it hard for those who target us to track us down.
> 
> This is a lesson for everyone, and well known in the domestic violence sector for decades: the right to remain anonymous and unknown, is any given person's first, best line of defense and personal safety.
> 
> Generally, in common law jurisdictions like the US, "public figures", such as celebrities, politicians, and civil servants (including judges) and other 'state actors' have the lowest right and expectation of such privacy. This judge's advocacy for such a basic and fundamental security measures, born of her personal tragedy, is a good idea - but it must be even more strictly held for the private members of the general public.

## USA now vaccinating more people against COVID-19 in one day than Canada has in total

Summary of [original article](https://www.cp24.com/news/usa-now-vaccinating-more-people-against-covid-19-in-one-day-than-canada-has-in-total-1.5317891):

> A recent ramping up of the United States's vaccine rollout has it vastly outpacing its northern neighbour, and some Canadians are wondering why distribution here is lagging so far behind. The Americans have many factors in their favour when speeding up vaccine distribution, experts say, including a much more expansive supply than Canada's that's bolstered by production from U.S.-based Moderna. Canada has not yet reached the pharmacy stage of its vaccine rollout, but Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert with the University of Toronto, expects that to happen once we have enough supply to branch out.

## Millions of Tenants Behind on Rent, Small Landlords Struggling, Eviction Moratoriums Expiring Soon: Inside the Next Housing Crisis

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5940505/housing-crisis-2021/):

> On social media, the looming eviction crisis is often rendered in Dickensian caricature: greedy fat-cat landlords pushing vulnerable tenants into the street amid the worst health crisis in a century, while activists demand that the government "Cancel rent" entirely. Some landlords may be put off by the bureaucratic hurdles of applying for aid-a reality that may drive mom-and-pop landlords out of the rental market, leading to a long-term decrease in affordable rental housing in communities where it was already scarce. "We like to say that if we're raising the next generation of public-housing applicants, we failed," says Stephen Norman, the executive director of the King County housing authority, which developed the project.

`/u/CerddwrRhyddid` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/loxw3w/millions_of_tenants_behind_on_rent_small/):

> This is just going to end up with a lot more money going to anyone richer than anyone else.
> 
> Small landlords are going to have to sell, to larger companies.
> 
> Meanwhile, anyone in low rent tenancy gets shafted.
> 
> If this is handled anywhere near to how COVID or Texas was, a lot of people are going to be totally fucked.

## U.S. reaches 500,000 deaths from the coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-reaches-500-000-deaths-coronavirus-n1257992):

> The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus topped 500,000 on Sunday,according to an NBC News tally - a milestone that underscores the grave threat the virus still poses nationwide even as more Americans get vaccinated. More than 28,206,600 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., according to the NBC News tally. "We are still at about 100,000 cases a day. We are still at around 1,500 to 3,500 deaths per day. The cases are more than two-and-a-half-fold times what we saw over the summer," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.

`/u/alabasterheart` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lpf450/us_reaches_500000_deaths_from_the_coronavirus/):

> It's hard to comprehend just how much half a million lives lost is, but I think [this visualization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/500000-covid-deaths-visualized/) does a pretty good job. It's more than the number of people living in Kansas City, the number of people killed in any war in US history besides the Civil War, and over 10 times the number of people who died from traffic accidents last year.
