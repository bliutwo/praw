## Amazon had sales income of €44bn in Europe in 2020 but paid no corporation tax

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/04/amazon-sales-income-europe-corporation-tax-luxembourg):

> Fresh questions have been raised over Amazon's tax planning after its latest corporate filings in Luxembourg revealed that the company collected record sales income of €44bn in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy. The Luxembourg unit - which handles sales for the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden - employs just 5,262 staff meaning that the income per employ amounts to €8.4m.Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned against tax avoidance, said: "It seems that Amazon's relentless campaign of appalling tax avoidance continues."Amazon's revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle, yet it continues to shift its profits to tax havens like Luxembourg to avoid paying its fair share of tax. It said the group paid just $3.4bn in tax on its income so far this decade, despite achieving revenues of $961bn and profits of $26.8bn.The Fair Tax Foundation said this meant Amazon's effective tax rate was 12.7% over the decade when the headline tax rate in the US had been 35% for most of that period.

> I am not a big fan of Amazon but let’s be honest here. These countries created these loopholes in their tax code so that large foreign corporations like Amazon open up shop in their countries. Now instead of bitching and whining how about you fix your tax codes and close such loopholes?

> Protecting innocent people is “taking sides” now I see. Absolutely appalling.
