> This is the only homicide crime they have that fits these facts.

> Other states have Reckless Homicide or Criminally Negligent homicide but not MN. They kind of clumsily lump this behavior into a couple of manslaughter statutes that they further breakdown into intentional and unintentional killings.

> Max penalty of 10 years. That often gets you probation if you have no previous record, in most states. Will need a MN attorney to tell us if that's how it typically works there.

## Prosecutors: No charges for officer in Capitol riot shooting

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/cef4da2291ce3c98b0d232220bd288e6):

> Authorities had considered for months whether criminal charges were appropriate for the Capitol Police officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego. Prosecutors said Babbitt was part of the mob that was trying to get into the House as Capitol Police officers were evacuating members of Congress from the chamber. "Specifically, the investigation revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber," prosecutors said.

`/u/TheCSM` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/mqvo29/prosecutors_no_charges_for_officer_in_capitol/):

> Every VIP security team has an evacuation and lockdown plans. The lockdown plans involve establishing a defendable hard point and do not cross lines. If attackers cross those lines attempting entry to that is when they will be shot.
> Ashley Babbit crossed the line. She got shot. This is cut dry and absolutely simple and could not understand seeing it any other way.

## Former Buffalo officer who stopped fellow cop's chokehold on suspect will get pension after winning lawsuit

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-buffalo-officer-who-stopped-a-fellow-cops-chokehold-on-a-suspect-will-receive-pension-after-winning-lawsuit/):

> A former Buffalo Police officer who said she was fired for intervening when a White officer attempted to choke a Black suspect will receive her pension after winning a lawsuit on Tuesday. Horne gained national attention in 2006 when she said she stopped officer Greg Kwiatkowski's chokehold on Neal Mack. In 2011, a judge found that Horne's lawyer made eight statements that were considered defamatory and false, including the claim that Horne "Saved the life of a suspect who was already in handcuffs and was being choked out by officer Greg Kwiatkowski."
