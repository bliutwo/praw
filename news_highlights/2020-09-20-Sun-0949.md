## Detroit Driver Arrested After Successfully Jumping Over Drawbridge

Summary of [original article](https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/video-detroit-driver-arrested-after-successfully-jumping-over-drawbridge/):

> A foolhardy motorist in Detroit is in hot water with the law after he channeled his inner action hero and jumped over a drawbridge in his car. The driver had a rather ill-conceived alternative approach and opted to floor it towards the growing opening. "Over he went, blew out all four of his tires," Locke said, "And then he crashed into the other gate." While successfully completing such a jump may be cause for celebration in the movies, in this instance it led to the man being arrested since, with his car badly damaged, he was unable to flee the scene.

`/u/YourMomsDone69` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/iw5cd8/detroit_driver_arrested_after_successfully/):

> > Drawbridge operator Andre Locke, who watched the wild scene unfold, recalled that “I looked, I said, ‘no, he ain’t’.....Over he went, blew out all four of his tires, and then he crashed into the other gate.” 
> 
> Yeah, this looked *waaaay* cooler in my head. Thanks for bringing everyone back down to reality, Andre.
