> Inside, along with electronic and other important items and documents, was what looked like a simple teddy bear. "At hospice her voice was different. Much softer. Not the mom I grew up with. That bear is the last memory I have of her speaking in her normal voice," Soriano told CBC. Soriano searched everywhere for the bear, accompanied by CBC news crews. This week, two men found the bear and returned it to Soriano at the CBC studios.

> Best part of the article: *”This week, two men found the bear and returned it to Soriano at the CBC studios. They said they took the stuffed animal from the man who took the bag.”*
> 
> I’m picturing two tough looking gangsters suddenly seeing the bear peeking out of a stash bag and smacking the thief upside his head. “You idiot, you don’t just steal a woman’s bear! Jeezus now we godda return this!”

## 4 Alabama corrections officers indicted, accused of excessive force, obstruction

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/4-alabama-corrections-officers-indicted-accused-excessive-force-obstruction-n1235155):

> Four Alabama corrections officers were indicted Tuesday on charges that they beat a prisoner on the ground or filed false reports about it, federal prosecutors said. Thomas and Sgt. Orlanda Walker are also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly filing false reports claiming that once the prisoner was on the ground "All force ceased," the Justice Department said in a statement. The federal grand jury indictments were returned less than a week after the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division released the results of an investigation that "Found reasonable cause to believe that there is a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners in Alabama's prisons for men."

## Seattle Mayor Says U.S. Agents Have Demobilized and Left the City

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5873036/seattle-mayor-federal-agents-demobilized/):

> SEATTLE - Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said Tuesday she had received confirmation that U.S. agents had left the area after being sent to Seattle last week to protect federal buildings amid lingering unrest over the police killing of George Floyd. The agents arrived Thursday after businesses in Seattle were vandalized in the downtown area and in the nearby Capitol Hill neighborhood. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty on Monday asked Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf for a meeting to discuss a cease-fire and their desire for the removal of the extra federal agents.

## Video Shows Protester Being Pulled Into Unmarked Van By NYPD

Summary of [original article](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/07/29/video-shows-protester-being-pulled-into-unmarked-van-by-nypd):

> A video showing a protester being taken by NYPD officers into an unmarked van went viral on social media on Tuesday. The protester is seen being taken into an unmarked van by plainclothes Warrant Squad officers in Kips Bay while other uniformed officers keep other protesters away. Though the NYPD confirmed that the procedure is something used by Warrant Squad officers, the video drew comparisons to a tactic used by federal agents in Portland to arrest protesters there.

`/u/aniaran` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hzrr0c/video_shows_protester_being_pulled_into_unmarked/):

> To all of you having trouble understanding why this is concerning:
> 
> 1. This level of violence is far in excess for the crime alleged.  They supposedly have a warrant for this person's arrest, so go to their home and arrest them there.  Or just walk up to them on the street without throwing them bodily into a van.  She's not wanted for a violent crime, she's wanted for defacement.  That doesn't warrant treatment like this.
> 2. How do they know they got the right person?  Did they check her ID?  Did they have an opportunity to do so?  What are they operating off of?  Are they relying on facial recognition which has a **lot** of problems and has been shown to consistently fuck up?
> 3. When did we reach the point that what is essentially vandalism actually warrants an *arrest,* let alone one like this?  Fucking ticket her or issue a court summons.  If you think you've got the right person and have reliable evidence simply send a certified letter or send an officer to her door to issue the citation.
> 
> Running up on someone on the street and bodily chucking them into the back of a van by going from 0 to 60 immediately is fucking troubling.  Nothing I've seen of the alleged crimes would justify this type of scenario and the fact that people are trying to justify it is weird to me.  If she was running coke or had just held someone at gunpoint sure, but damaging police cameras?
> 
> Also I have no sympathy for the officers.  When you act like that and make those around you fearful of your aggression you have it coming.  There were a lot better ways to handle this and they directly created this hostility themselves.  Convey that you're a threat and the enemy and you'll be treated as such.

## Federal Tactical Teams to Withdraw From Portland

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/protests-portland-federal-withdrawal.html):

> An agreement between federal and state officials calls for the Oregon State Police to provide security for the exterior of the courthouse, while the usual team of federal officers that protects the courthouse year-round will continue to provide security for the interior of the courthouse. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that while the department has agreed with the Oregon governor on a withdrawal plan, the department will proceed with the withdrawal of security personnel in Portland only if federal officials are confident that federal properties will no longer be under attack. The arrival of federal forces to protect the courthouse after weeks of raucous demonstrations outside protesting the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis infuriated local officials who did not ask for the federal deployment.
