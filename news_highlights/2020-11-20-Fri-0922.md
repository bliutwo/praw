## Protesters sue Chicago Police over 'brutal, violent' tactics

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/protesters-sue-chicago-police-brutal-violent-tactics-74300602):

> According to the lawsuit, police beat the protesters with batons, often striking them in the head; tackled and beat protesters while on the ground; used chemical agents against protesters; and trapped protesters in enclosed areas. The attorneys say the mistreatment of the protesters is part of a history of police brutality and abuse that dates back well over a century, including race riots in 1919 and the violent confrontations during protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. "CPD's response to the summer 2020 protests is consistent with the CPD's longstanding policies and practices of using abusive tactics and excessive force against protesters." the lawsuit says.

> My state's hospitals are starting to ration care because they are swamped with cases. They are going to be moving patents out of the ICU who are not improving or if someone younger is admitted.
> 
> And there are cases now of people trying to get into hospitals under false pretenses because they want to film the "hoax" because they are convinced the patients are fake and there's no crisis.

> Meanwhile, Mike Pence said the media was crying wolf on Covid.

> “We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 
> 
> “We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”
> 
> Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”

> Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”
> 
> The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising. The hospital is already at capacity.”

## Apple accuses Facebook of 'disregard for user privacy'

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/20/apple-accuses-facebook-of-disregard-for-user-privacy?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other):

> Apple has criticised Facebook for trying to "Collect as much data as possible" from users, saying it will push ahead with its planned launch of a new privacy feature despite objections from the advertising industry. "Not only do they allow the grouping of users into smaller segments, they use detailed data about online browsing activity to target ads."Facebook executives have made clear their intent is to collect as much data as possible across both first and third party products to develop and monetise detailed profiles of their users, and this disregard for user privacy continues to expand to include more of their products,. In a privacy case filed on Monday, the consumer rights activist Max Schrems argued that the tracking capabilities violate privacy regulations - and would continue to do so even after Apple's planned changes were implemented.

## Mexico's Senate approves sweeping cannabis legalization bill

Summary of [original article](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mexico-cannabis-vote/mexicos-senate-approves-sweeping-cannabis-legalization-bill-idUKKBN27Z3BG):

> 1 Min Read.MEXICO CITY - Mexico's Senate approved a sweeping cannabis legalization bill in a lopsided 82 to 18 vote on Thursday, paving the way for the creation of the world's largest legal marijuana market if the initiative passes the next hurdle in the lower house of Congress. Lawmakers are rushing to secure approval before the end of the current congressional session in mid-December. If given the green light, the law would allow the recreational, scientific, medical and industrial uses of cannabis, a major shift in the country where drug cartel violence in recent years has claimed over 100,000 lives.
