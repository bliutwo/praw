## Minnesota State Sen. Jerry Relph dies from COVID-19 complications

Summary of [original article](https://abcn.ws/2J9umRq):

> "I'm heartbroken to share that my husband, Jerry Relph, has passed away and entered his heavenly home. Jerry was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather. He was a Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam, an attorney, small businessman, and dedicated public servant in the Minnesota Senate," Pegi Broker-Relph wrote. "Jerry dedicated his life to service and representing Senate District 14 was one of the highest honors he had.I can't count the number of times he would come home at night and tell me about helping solve a constituent's problem, or a story he heard from someone in a parade or at a public event, or even just someone he met during a 'day on the hill' event. He loved serving the people of St. Cloud in the Senate, and he cherished every minute of it. Jerry loved diving into the issues, finding compromise, and working together to solve problems and I have no doubt he would have continued solving problems outside the legislature," she added. Majority Leader Paul Gazelka wrote on Twitter: "Senator Jerry Relph was a true friend and colleague loved by so many. For four years, he rolled up his sleeves and tackled tough issues for our state. Senator Relph will always be remembered as a dedicated public servant. He was already thinking of ways to have an impact on his community after narrowly losing his re-election. We are deeply saddened by his passing and offer our prayers and support to the Relph family."

> They had his DNA from crime scenes but he was not in any criminal database so there was nothing to compare it too. So they got to him through DNA of his family members -   I wonder if any of his relatives used a genetic service like “23 and me” and that’s how their genetic material entered some database that was then mined.

> Edit: 23andMe not 21andMe. I blame a temporary laziness of neurons on this blunder.

## ‘I want to hit this kid’: Newly unearthed body cam footage shines light on Boston police during racial justice protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/12/18/boston-police-body-cam-footage-video-racial-justice-protests):

> Newly unearthed body camera footage captured by Boston police during the demonstrations protesting racial injustice and police brutality in May shows officers using force against nonviolent protesters, pepper-spraying crowds, and, in one instance, speaking about hitting protesters with a car. "The inexcusable actions of officers in these disturbing videos make painfully clear why our communities are standing up, speaking out and demanding decisive action to combat the public health crisis that is police brutality in our nation. We can and must advance bold and systemic policy change at all levels of government to bring an end to the toxic culture of police impunity that has fueled these abuses and begin to legislate true justice and healing for our communities." "Contrary to the claims by police unions and other opponents of meaningful reform, Massachusetts is not immune to police misconduct and police violence-including against Black and brown people. These disturbing videos show exactly why strong police reform is needed in Massachusetts now. Just steps from the State House, a police officer admittedly drove his vehicle into peaceful protestors and, after realizing he had been caught on tape bragging about it, falsely alleged that it was because demonstrators acted violently. Local police repeatedly and with apparent relish battered demonstrators, including with batons and pepper spray. It's time for systemic change and an end to policing as usual."

> Jeez, it's not like there is some kinda massive movement to hold cops accountable or anything.
