> The below is based on my limited experience practicing criminal defense and my limited knowledge of sentencing guidelines, so take it with a grain of salt.
> 
> TL;DR: My guess is Chauvin will spend about 20 years in prison total on federal and state charges combined.
> 
> Even finding an upward departure from the range is appropriate, the maximum sentence the judge is permitted to order under MN law is 30 years. MN law only allows the judge to sentence Chauvin to double the upper limit of the guideline. The upper limit of the guideline is 15 years, so Chauvin can be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years. Chauvin is required to serve at least 2/3s of whatever sentence is given.
> 
> In this case, the judge will quite possibly depart from the guidelines, entering a sentence of more than 15 years, but I'd wager he won't sentence Chauvin to more than 20 years. So, my guess is that Chauvin will be sentenced to 15-20 years on this state charge, and he'll end up in state prison for 10 to 13.7 years.
> 
> Sentences on federal charges can be run concurrently, but the presumption is that they won't be run concurrently. Chauvin faces federal charges for two incidents, and those sentences would not run concurrently. Federal guidelines are much more complex than state guidelines, but suffice it to say Chauvin is looking at at least ten years in federal prison on the federal charges of which he is required to serve 85%.
> 
> So I'd guess total time behind bars between federal and state charges will be somewhere around 20 years.
> 
> **Edited to add an answer to someone's very good question below:**
> 
> The max state sentence is 30 years because the judge is limited by a combination of the sentencing guidelines and what's generally referred to in MN as the Evans rule, based on a 1981 Minnesota Supreme Court decision. (Here's the case, State v. Evans, [https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914914dadd7b04934585d32](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914914dadd7b04934585d32), and here are the guidelines: [https://mn.gov/sentencing-guidelines/guidelines/](https://mn.gov/sentencing-guidelines/guidelines/), click "Standard Grid.)
> 
> What Evans essentially says is that the maximum sentence a judge can give for a a crime is a sentence double the presumptive sentence. The presumptive sentence for unintentional murder 2 by someone with no prior criminal record is 128-180 months under the guidelines. So under Evans, the maximum sentence is 180 x 2 = 360 months, or 30 years.
> 
> In addition, Chauvin will only be sentenced on the murder 2 charge and not the murder 3 or man 2 charge he was also convicted of because MN law only permits one sentence per incident. There was one murder here, so Chauvin is sentenced once for that murder.

## Brett Favre owes Mississippi $600,000 in speaking fees for events he never attended, officials say

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brett-favre-owes-mississippi-600-000-speaking-fees-events-he-n1267066):

> JACKSON, Miss. - Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre has yet to pay back $600,000 he received from the state of Mississippi for multiple speaking events where he never showed up, authorities said Tuesday. The audit claimed Favre Enterprises was paid $500,000 in December 2017 and $600,000 in June 2018, and Favre was supposed to have made speeches for at least three events. Several people, including the former head of the state's welfare agency, top officials at the Mississippi Community Education Center and ex-wrestler Brett DiBiase, were indicted in state court and are awaiting trial in the aftermath of the audit.

> This gets more disgusting the more you read.  Start off with the state with one of the worst education systems in the nation.  They get $94 million for their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.  Instead of using it for needy families, they carve out crony contracts including $1.1 million to Favre for speaking gigs.  Farve then just pockets it and doesn't show for the engagements.

> Everyone here sucks.

## Chemical giants hid dangers of ‘forever chemicals’ in food packaging

> Chemical giants DuPont and Daikin knew the dangers of a PFAS compound widely used in food packaging since 2010, but hid them from the public and the Food and Drug Administration, company studies obtained by the Guardian reveal. DuPont hides alarming new dataIndustry reports and communications among the FDA and PFAS producers between 2008 and 2020 show how a sequence of inadequate chemical safety analyses, hidden studies and lax oversight created a scenario in which Americans continue to be exposed to the dangerous compound in food packaging. The agency's own scientists were in a rush to get it out of the marketplace so it's really hard to understand why the FDA agreed to a five-year phase-out A 2019 communication between the FDA and the PFAS manufacturer Asahi showed urgency on the part of the agency to get the chemical removed from the market, but in July 2020 it announced that four major producers of the compound had agreed to have all food packaging with 6:2 FTOH off the shelves by 2025.In its announcement, the FDA wrote that the extended timeline "Balances uncertainty about the potential for public health risks with minimizing potential market disruptions to food packaging supply chains during the Covid-19 public health emergency".

> Hale called **LaPierre's decision to file for bankruptcy without notifying the NRA's board** and others "troubling" in his decision.
> 
> It's been downright hilarious watching LaPierre turn the NRA into his own little piggy bank, and also to see how spineless their board and members are, and how utterly gullible their donors are. I don't personally know any 2A people who donate to NRA, but I'd love to talk to someone who does and get hear their logic for supporting an openly and obviously corrupt organization that operates purely to bilk gun owners.

> Similar to Marsh, Eric Brown, a maintenance worker at the Tyson in Hope, said he has not feared going to work during the pandemic because Tyson management installed dividers, and enforced use of masks and face shields in the workplace. Tyson's reported 2,866 sick workers were four times greater than the next-most-prevalent company, George's Inc., which reported 704 sick workers. Despite worker concerns and thousands of illnesses, few workers in Arkansas complained to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency that oversees workplace safety.
