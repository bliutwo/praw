## US Ice officers 'used torture to make Africans sign own deportation orders'

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/22/us-ice-officers-allegedly-used-torture-to-make-africans-sign-own-deportation-orders):

> US immigration officers allegedly tortured Cameroonian asylum seekers to force them to sign their own deportation orders, in what lawyers and activists describe as a brutal scramble to fly African migrants out of the country in the run-up to the elections. Victims, family members, lawyers and human rights activists have described a range of coercive measures used by Ice on Cameroonian detainees at the Adams county correctional centre in Mississippi to make them sign their own deportation orders. Two Cameroonians were taken off the 13 October deportation flight at the last moment after the intervention of human rights advocates through the office for civil rights and civil liberties in the Department of Homeland Security, but they have been told by Ice agents it will not save them from deportation.

> So, when exactly is the American government going to take their head out of their ass and let the man back in? He wants to go back. The things he uncovered were unconstitutional. He uncovered criminal acts and paid for it with his future. I still remember people insulting him on reddit because they considered him a traitor. That guy is more patriotic than every single one of these dipshits laughing about him. C'mon, take the guy back who made sure your democracy stays a democracy (yeah, the last sentence was a joke I know)

> 
> Interesting. I'm curious the judge's reasoning on this.
> 
> I hope they weren't just trying to leave prosecutors with only the harder to prove crimes, but if that was the case I'd think they'd also have dropped the manslaughter charge.
> 
> Very irresponsible headline though, not making it clear significant charges weren't dropped.

> The president doesn't want to talk about it, the senate is holding up stimulus, this is the third spike (first time experts are saying could be worse than the last). How is it that no one seems to care? We could see 250,000 deaths from now till January and people are so lax about it.

Surveillance video shows several men follow Grogan out to the street and body camera footage shows them yelling at the arresting officers.
