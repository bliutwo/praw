> The shitty thing about this is that it’s going to be the taxpayer’s money that will be paying for their healthcare since they’re a *public official* while everyone else have to pay their own or die.

## No voting system deleted or lost votes in U.S. election: security groups

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber/no-voting-system-deleted-or-lost-votes-in-u-s-election-security-groups-idUSKBN27T038):

> 2 Min Read.WASHINGTON - Election security officials have no evidence that ballots were deleted or lost by voting systems in this month's U.S. election, two security groups said in a statement released on Thursday by the lead U.S. cybersecurity agency. "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," the groups said about the Nov. 3 election won by Joe Biden, a Democrat. The groups, the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council, said the election was the most secure in U.S. history.

> You know what, even when it’s officially concluded that little to no voter fraud took place, he’s still going to keep saying he won. Biden could be in office for a year and Trump will still be tweeting he was scammed.
> 
> EDIT: And I’ll save you all the trouble of commenting “Just like Hillary” or some relative whataboutism- since it’s all conveniently being spammed at the exact same time:
> 
> Hillary Clinton wasn’t a sitting president that has incessantly been bitching and moaning on Twitter about everything since 2016 and riling up a coalition of unhinged right wingers. Listen, I’ll admit that she lost straight up (she conceded by the way) - and for legitimate reasons too, in my opinion. But Trump’s delusions about the results combined with the fact that he’s *supposed to be the fucking President*, or at least act like it, is a whole other ballgame and, honestly, it’s disgraceful to all of us living in this country. What’s disheartening is that this has been telegraphed as his playcall since August and people are really still eating it up.

> Wait.... you get two years in prison for threatening to burn down a church? But nothing, not even Facebook suspension, for threatening and calling for the action to chop off our lead infectious disease expert? I’m so confused.
