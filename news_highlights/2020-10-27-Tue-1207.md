## Millions poised to lose unemployment benefits in 'enormous cliff' at year's end

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/unemployment-benefits-will-end-for-millions-without-more-stimulus.html):

> A federal program paying benefits to gig workers and others is poised to lapse after December, as is one paying extra relief to workers who've exhausted their standard state benefit. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, for example, offers federal benefits to groups like the self-employed, gig workers and others who were previously ineligible for unemployment insurance from their state. Many people who exhaust their state's allotment of unemployment insurance would be eligible to continue getting benefits after the end of the year via state Extended Benefits programs.

> And Moscow Mitch just adjourned the senate until Nov 9th, because they clearly don't care.

## R. Kelly was beaten in jail while 'no one raised a finger,' attorneys say

> I do not feel bad for Kelly, but this is not the kind of justice system I would advocate for. Prisoners' basic safety should be protected, and the system should be reformative, not punitive. To the extent that some offenders can or will not be reformed, keeping them separate from the general public should be enough.

## 'Sleeping giant' Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/27/sleeping-giant-arctic-methane-deposits-starting-to-release-scientists-find?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other):

> Scientists have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean - known as the "Sleeping giants of the carbon cycle" - have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast, the Guardian can reveal. The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases - known as hydrates. The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits in the ocean.

`/u/UT_Teapot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jj3pgg/sleeping_giant_arctic_methane_deposits_starting/):

> Hi everybody, I've been paying close attention to this story for some years now so I want to provide more context since the article is leaving out some key details. 
> 
> 1. This is not the clathrate gun firing.
> 
> 2. This is not that 50 gigatons of Methane that some claimed would be released.
> 
> 3. Most of the methane is dissolving in the water due to the depth of the deposits. 
> 
> 4. There's more and more evidence that this release is due to a geological event that started some 8,000 years ago and not to do with global warming, and the contribution these specific gas deposits will have on global warming will be minimal to negligible. Hydrates are being found to be far more stable in above freezing temperatures than previously thought. 
> 
> 5. The results of this study have not been released. [In fact this same team reported the exact same thing around October of last year and no updates were provided after.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/us/arctic-methane-gas-flare-trnd/index.html) So we're essentially seeing the same story released twice with no new information. 
> 
> 6. Semiletov has said that these emissions will pale in comparison to the ones that humanity will emit.
> 
> 7. A new study from a few days ago with observational evidence backs up the hypothesis that dormant carbon in the Arctic will not lead to a massive GHG release leading to runaway warming as some have claimed without evidence to back it up. To add to this, this is partially due to the fact that during the last interglacial period global temps were 1-2 degrees higher than today, with a ice-free Arctic summer.

> Shameless plug, if you want to hear good news on action against climate change that isn't a protest or proposal come over to /r/climateactionplan. There's good news happening every day in the fight against climate change. In fact right now we're [holding a fundraiser](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/iooiav/rclimeactionplan_and_climeworks_are_collaborating/) to bring 5,000 subscribers to Climeworks, a company that captures and permanently stores CO2 into the ground. I myself am a subscriber to Climeworks to permanently offset my emissions. Their plan over the next 5 years is to build a facility that captures 500,000 tons of CO2, then to go world wide. 
> 
> 
> **TL;DR** I wouldn't actually worry about this as there's more evidence that this is caused by natural forces rather than global warming. Even if this is shallow deposits becoming destabilized it's effect on global warming is more long term than immediate. Also this was reported in October 2019 by the same team and both times they haven't published their results just yet.

## Family sues Texas county for wrongful death of Black man during 'Live PD' production

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-sues-texas-county-wrongful-death-black-man-during-live-n1244813):

> The family of a Black man who died after a car chase with deputies accompanied by a reality television camera crew filed a lawsuit against Williamson County, Texas, where a sheriff is already facing tampering charges in the case. The family of Javier Ambler filed suit on Sunday under the state's Wrongful Death Act, alleging that sheriff's deputies engaged in a reckless chase of Ambler in order to make entertaining television for "Live PD," the lawsuit said. "Sheriff Chody's permissive chase policy, and his policy of allowing Live PD to film policing activities as 'entertainment,' encouraged Johnson to chase Ambler for this trivial offense," the lawsuit said.

> Just a reminder to anyone living in Wilco that you can help vote out sheriff Chody.
