> I got approached at a gas station by someone with a petition to revoke our governor’s emergency powers.  They were from a “bipartisan” volunteer org, but played dumb when I started asking questions about who was sponsoring this initiative and what they were after (because they “represented the voters”).  Yeah.  Fuck outta here.

## Maine postal workers reassemble high-speed sorting machine

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/73734f7c725609742316313361da6f3f):

> SCARBOROUGH, Maine - U.S. Postal Service workers have reassembled one of the two high-speed letter sorting machines that were ordered dismantled over the summer in Maine. WMTW-TV reports the machine that can sort more than 20,000 letters an hour went back into operation on Thursday. The American Postal Workers Union pushed management to restore the machine to help deliver election-related mail promptly.

> Discarded for scrap metal. They discarded a purpose built mail sorting machine that costs god knows how much for fucking scrap. Not even spare parts!

## Tennessee mayor Lonnie Norman dies of Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-mayor-lonnie-norman-dies-covid-19-n1242958):

> The mayor of a small town in Tennessee died Monday of Covid-19, officials said. Manchester Mayor Lonnie Norman was hospitalized earlier this month before passing away "After a valiant fight against COVID-19," the city said in a Facebook post Monday. In August, Norman was elected to his third term as mayor of Manchester, a town with a population of nearly 10,000 people, according to WPLN.He was the city's first Black mayor when he served in 1991, WPLN reported.

`/u/Geass10` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/j9tb9d/tennessee_mayor_lonnie_norman_dies_of_covid19/):

> My condolences to the family. I live near the area, and I heard mostly good things about the guy.
> 
> Local cases like this people on this site should look at with a smaller scope, the mayor's of these small towns are not like the politicians you see on TV. The place I work at on the board has both Republicans and Democrats working together.

## Solar power provided 100 per cent of demand in South Australia for the first time today.

Summary of [original article](https://reneweconomy.com.au/solar-meets-100-per-cent-of-south-australia-demand-for-first-time-78279/):

> The combination of rooftop and utility scale solar met 100 per cent of demand in South Australia for the first time on Sunday, reaching a milestone that will surely be repeated many times over - and for longer periods - in the future. The new record came just weeks after solar set a previous milestone of 94 per cent of state demand and rooftop solar output reached 900MW for the first time. The continued surged in rooftop solar installations means that South Australia is also likely to reach a new milestone of having rooftop solar along meet 100 per cent of its demand needs.

`/u/theshoeshiner84` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/j9oa31/solar_power_provided_100_per_cent_of_demand_in/):

> This is talking about *instantaneous* demand, which it met for 2 hours. The headline sort of makes it seem as if it provided all the power necessary for the entire day, which it didn't. We're still a long way from that, if ever, using solar alone, due to battery technology.
> 
> Edit: That wasn't meant to diminish the accomplishment, just clarify the headline, which I initially thought implied the use of some revolutionary energy storage tech, but really is more a policy/implementation success story.
> 
> Edit: Although I was referring to chemical energy batteries, lots of people have brought up that energy storage can also be accomplished through many other means, e.g. hydro and inertial storage systems. Those are probably part of the solution too. Though it seems (from a layman's perspective) that their value is more a function of resources and not technology, whereas as electric batteries seem to get better with more R&D. Either way, storage is still a hurdle for all solar power, and I'm guessing (correct me if I'm wrong) that we'd have to go through many iterations before we were comfortable enough pulling the plug on nuclear.
> 
> Edit: Also don't take that to mean I'm anti-nuclear. If we continue to improve our implementation or perhaps make the jump to fusion, then there's no reason nuclear can't continue to be part of our energy sources.
> 
> Edit: Damn, I don't deserve a medal, but read the interesting discussions in the thread for far more info than I could possibly provide!
