## Man tests positive for Covid for 305 days straight in 'world's longest case'

Summary of [original article](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-tests-positive-covid-305-20890007):

> A 72-year-old man who tested positive for coronavirus for 305 days straight is thought to be the world's longest ever Covid patient. Dave Smith, from Bristol, said he was ready to die and give up on life, before recently celebrating the news he was Covid negative with a bottle of champagne. The combination of antibodies, by pharmaceutical firm Regeneron, has since been shown to save the lives of some of the sickest Covid-19 patients in a clinical trial, but the treatment regime is yet to be approved for use in the UK. Mr Smith no longer tests positive some 305 days after first infection, academics have told conference officials.

## Leonard Crow Dog, Spiritual Leader at Wounded Knee, Dies at 78 | He served time in prison after the 1973 occupation on the Pine Ridge reservation and dedicated his life to preserving the traditions of the Sicangu Lakota

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/us/leonard-crow-dog-dead.html?=):

> Leonard Crow Dog was born on Aug. 18, 1942, to Henry and Mary Gertrude Crow Dog on the Rosebud Sioux reservation in South Dakota, home to the people also known as the Sicangu Lakota. As a leader of the Native American Church, which combines tribal and Christian elements, Chief Crow Dog oversaw traditional peyote rituals. Chief Crow Dog remained active in later life, traveling to the Standing Rock Reservation to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Native American lands and becoming involved in a project to preserve the Pe' Sla sacred lands in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

`/u/Illustrious_Welder94` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/o6rd6t/leonard_crow_dog_spiritual_leader_at_wounded_knee/):

> > The first clash between Native Americans and the United States government at Wounded Knee was in 1890, when federal forces killed hundreds of unarmed Lakota people. In February 1973, hundreds of Native American activists returned to the site, on the Pine Ridge Reservation, bearing a list of grievances and demanding that broken treaties be honored.
> Chief Crow Dog was among them. He tended to injured protesters and negotiated with federal forces throughout the occupation, which lasted 71 days. He also held a traditional ghost dance ceremony at Wounded Knee to honor those who had died in the massacre nearly a century before.
> Though the Native American occupiers eventually surrendered, the confrontation brought about a new understanding of the mistreatment of tribes by the federal government.
> 
> > In the fall of 1972, A.I.M. delegates, Chief Crow Dog among them, sent to Washington a 20-point proposal called the Trail of Broken Treaties. The government responded that fulfilling all the demands, including land restoration and the creation of a new office of federal Indian relations and community reconstruction, would be “impracticable.”
> Chief Crow Dog called it “the greatest gathering of Indians in the nation’s capital.”
> The occupation at Wounded Knee the following February grew out of the movement’s frustration with the government’s response to its demands, one of which was that it help remove the chief of the Pine Ridge Reservation, Richard Wilson. Chief Wilson “ran the tribe like a dictator and won elections by fraud,” Chief Crow Dog said.
> He was one of the seven principal defendants in the Wounded Knee trials, alongside Russell Means, a founder of the movement, and Carter Camp, one of its leaders. Chief Crow Dog was convicted of charges related to the occupation and of unconnected assault charges involving an altercation. He ended up serving about two years in prison, released in 1977 after his sentence was reduced thanks to a lobbying campaign by his lawyers and supporters, according to Edward J. Rielly’s “Legends of American Indian Resistance” (2011).

> This is so fucked. She asked for comments to be made public, here are some selections from what she said:
> 
> "The control he had to hurt his own daughter he loved it. I worked seven days a week ... it was like sex trafficking. I didn't have a credit card, cash or my passport."
> 
> "I'm traumatized. I'm not happy, I can't sleep. I'm so angry, it's insane,"
> 
> "I have never said it openly I didn't think anything of it. I thought people would make fun of me, she's lying, she's got everything, she's Britney Spears. It's been long time since I've owned my money. It's my wish for this to end," 
> 
> "For the past f***ing 13 years, I'm been so good and so pretty and I do everything," she said. "I can't allow my ignorant father to do that to me ... I don't even drink alcohol. I should drink alcohol given what they've put my heart through."
> 
> "I want to be able to get married and have a baby. I was told I can't get married. I have an IUD inside me but this so-called team won't let me go to the doctor to remove it because they don't want me to have anymore children. This conservatorship is doing me way more harm then good."
> 
> "I'd like to be able to share my story with the world," she said. "I want to be able to be heard. By making me keep this in for so long, it's not good for my heart. It concerns me I'm not allowed to be able to heard. I have the right to use my voice. My attorney says I can't let the public know what they did to me ... I shouldn't be able to be in a conservatorship. The laws need to change. Ma'am, I've worked since I was 17 years old. I can't go somewhere unless I meet someone every week in an office. I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive, but ma'am there are a thousand conservatorships that are abusive as well. I want to end the conservatorship.”
> 
> Spears ended her remarks by saying, "I deserve to have a two to three year break. I feel open and I'm OK to talk to you about this. I feel ganged up on, bullied, left out and alone. I'm tired of feeling alone. I deserve to have the same rights, having a child or any of those things."

## UK to ban Junk food TV adverts before 9pm

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57593599):

> Food companies have said outlawing any form of junk food advertising - worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year - would be disproportionate. Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: "These plans are a bold and very positive step forward in protecting children from being inundated with junk food advertising. "Introducing a 9pm TV watershed for junk food adverts and also further restrictions for online advertising is one important part in building a more healthy environment where the healthy option is the easy option."
