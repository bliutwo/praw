> Well, she's been denying everything, trying to get the charges dropped and demanding release on bail after being denied multiple times, so this comes as no surprise.

## Treasure hunter finds $46,000 hidden in cashbox beneath floorboards of Massachusetts family’s home after decades of rumor

Summary of [original article](https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2021/04/treasure-hunter-finds-46000-hidden-in-cashbox-beneath-floorboards-of-massachusetts-familys-home-after-decades-of-rumor.html):

> That's exactly what he did for one woman in Western Massachusetts who called him about trying to locate a cashbox potentially missing beneath the floorboards of the attic in her family home. The treasure hunt in Western Massachusetts was the product of decades of rumor about hidden loot in the 1950s home, which was owned by the woman's aunt and uncle. After decades of failed attempts to find the treasure, Wille said, the family grew tired of trying to figure out if a metal detector would work indoors and even hired a construction contractor to find the treasure underneath the floorboards.

At the hospital's oxygen supplier, Inox in Uttar Pradesh state about an hour from the capital, a line of a dozen trucks from cities across north India waited to fill up.

> Everyone saying this is a bad idea, go read the article. The mental health teams are not called to respond to violent situations. This team in Eugene, OR responded to 24,000 calls last year, mostly to deal with homeless people. So not only does it remove potentially violent escalations altogether, it also reduces the amount of resources wasted by PDs on non-threatening calls. Also, these aren't people being forced into this position, they're people that know how to deal with and de-escalate those with mental illnesses, which I would rather have instead of police who obviously aren't taught these tactics.

## Man sues Apple for terminating Apple ID with $24K worth of content

> The complaint, filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, goes after an Apple services clause that states a user with a terminated Apple ID cannot access media content that they've purchased. The complaint claims that users with Apple devices will find their products "Substantially diminished in value" if their Apple IDs are terminated, since they won't be able to access Apple services or purchased content. It does claim that Apple shut down the Apple ID "Without notice, explanation, policy or process."

> yea i hope the guy wins. there should be a process when apple wants to terminate the account and a ways to appeal it. for many people, many parts of their lives like list of contacts, schedules, photos, entertainment media, livelihood, etc. are tied to one account. no company must be able to willy-nilly cuts you without due process.
