> The 2 companies with seemingly valid vaccines can only make ~2 billion doses through 2021 which vaccinates 1 billion people. 
> 
> 
> How do they figure 100% of production for next year is going for this use? The distribution of the vaccine just doesn't add up with experts numbers.

I have been anointed with the blood of my savior Jesus Christ". And she was dead fucking serious.

## City issues warning letter to Toronto carpenter building shelters for unhoused people.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/city-legal-action-toronto-carpenter-toronto-tiny-shelters-unhoused-people-1.5811589):

> The City of Toronto has sent a warning letter to a Toronto carpenter who is building tiny mobile shelters for unhoused people ahead of winter and it says it could take legal action if the structures remain on city property. "The City of Toronto therefore demands that you immediately cease the production, distribution, supply and installation of such shelters for the purposes of placement and use on city property. Should you fail to do so, the city may, among other remedies, hold you responsible for the costs of removal of such structures." "Therefore, be advised that should the unlawful installation of these structures on city property continue, the city reserves its right to take legal action and/or employ any and all enforcement tools available to it under the relevant statutes and bylaws including, but not limited to, removal of the structures from city properties without further notice."

> "Any new shelters he builds will be placed on private property and there are churches already willing to house them on their grounds." From the article. The man's a saint in my opinion.

## More than 1 million people passed through US airports Friday, despite Covid warnings

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/21/business/us-air-travel-thanksgiving/index.html):

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/Darkframemaster43` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jywwjr/more_than_1_million_people_passed_through_us/):

> According to the official government statistics, [normally a little less than ~3 million people](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/by_the_numbers/) travel by air on average per day in the US to add some context to this number.
> 
> Last year, [about 26+ million](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2019/12/05/tsa-screened-record-breaking-number-thanksgiving-holiday-travelers) traveled by air over the Thanksgiving holiday period.
> 
> So while 1 million people traveling by air is still a significant number, it is thankfully much lower than it could be.
> 
> EDIT: Thank you to those who pointed out the typo in the Star Tribune article, I updated this post with a number given by the TSA because the other number people cited to point out the typo was just a projected number, not the actual amount of people who traveled.

> As a healthcare worker for the last 24 years, I feel like I need to put it out there that if people don’t start being responsible and flattening the curve, we are going to over-run our healthcare systems. Not only will we not have enough beds and ICU’s to treat Covid patients, but we will also run out of Human Resources. Nurses will get sick, doctors will get sick, respiratory therapists will get sick. Some of them will die. And they did not sign up for that. People are acting irresponsibly and not wearing masks and socially distancing because “freedom”. and their actions are directly affecting healthcare workers. Well, there is a point where we won’t have enough healthcare workers. ventilators, PPE or medical supplies to handle the number of Covid patients + regular patients. And now the fringe right is talking about a trucker strike. Great. So you want to stop delivering supplies to our country because you aren’t happy with the election? Really? While healthcare workers risk their lives? They could be striking because they are working inhumane hours to care for our sick, but they don’t because they have ethics yet you want to strike and deprive them of the supplies they need? You want to “own the libs” at the expense of those in need? Well, if they do that then they deserve the worst retribution that we can give them. I have to walk into Covid filled hospitals every day regardless of my political beliefs and still work to the best of my ability because people need care. And I will keep doing that because people need care. Just like I did in 2016.
