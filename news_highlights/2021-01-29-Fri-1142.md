## Former Boy Scouts Chaplain Is Sentenced to 40 Years in Prison for Sexual Abuse

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/boy-scouts-chaplain-sexual-assault.html):

> Jan. 28, 2021.A former chaplain for the Boy Scouts in Rhode Island was sentenced on Thursday to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest to charges that he sexually assaulted six young men, the authorities said - the latest reckoning for a national scouting movement beleaguered by sex-abuse claims. The ex-chaplain, James Glawson, 76, of Exeter, R.I., volunteered for the Boy Scouts from 1980 to 2018 and served as an assistant Catholic chaplain at the scouting camp in Hopkinton, R.I., according to the Rhode Island State Police. In a statement on Thursday night, the Boy Scouts of America said it had permanently barred Mr. Glawson in 2019."This individual's behavior is reprehensible and runs counter to everything for which the Boy Scouts of America stands," the Boy Scouts said.
