## Unsold U.S. hotel rooms near 1 billion as lodging crisis deepens

Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/unsold-u-s-hotel-rooms-near-1-billion-as-lodging-crisis-deepens/):

> As spiking COVID-19 cases further derail travel, the U.S. hotel industry is closing in on a bleak marker: one billion empty rooms for the year. Based on current occupancy rates, the industry will pass 1 billion unsold rooms around Christmas, deepening a crisis for owners that may worsen before a coronavirus vaccine can fuel a recovery. The occupancy rate for America's 5.3 million hotel rooms was 66% in 2019, just short of the record high; even so, more than 650 million room nights went unsold.

`/u/Splatterh0use` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ke6eb3/unsold_us_hotel_rooms_near_1_billion_as_lodging/):

> This has been in the air for quite some time. This pandemic was the final blow but before that, a shift in lodging led by Airbnb and alike have made their impact. On a personal note, I find the majority of hotels overpriced for the quality they advertise and offer.

## More people are getting COVID-19 twice, suggesting immunity wanes quickly in some

Summary of [original article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/more-people-are-getting-covid-19-twice-suggesting-immunity-wanes-quickly-some):

> The Hong Kong patient's second infection was milder than the first, which is what immunologists would expect, because the first infection typically generates some immunity. No proof exists of mutations that would make the virus more pathogenic or that might help the virus evade immunity. A recent preprint published by Chinese researchers suggested patients whose first COVID-19 infection is very severe may have ineffective antibodies, which might make them more prone to severe reinfections.

`/u/redditisntreallyfe` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/kea1ud/more_people_are_getting_covid19_twice_suggesting/):

> I donated plasma after getting covid because they are paying bank right now for that sweet sweet antibody. Donated twice and my levels dropped low enough that they no longer considered me part of the covid program anymore. That’s just 3 weeks! (2 week quarantine after negative diagnosis per their policy plus 2 donations in 1 week)

## Nestle illegally fires worker for reporting racist comment

Summary of [original article](https://www.hrdive.com/news/nlrb-nestle-illegally-fired-worker-for-reporting-racist-comment/592121/):

> The NLRB judge found Nestlé violated the Act not only when it suspended and discharged the employee because of the employee's protected concerted activity, but also when it "Coercively" instructed employees not to disclose aspects of its investigation and interrogated employees about their protected activity. The NLRB judge held the rep's comment did not contain a time limitation and "Was worded so broadly that it prohibited from talking to any employee about any disciplinary issue." Therefore, the comment violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, the judge said. NLRB has found similarly in other cases, including a 2018 decision involving an employer's questioning of an employee who appeared in a flyer.

`/u/CollegeSuperSenior` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/kdstuu/nestle_illegally_fires_worker_for_reporting/):

> I reported that my supervisor was making us work off the clock, I had solid proof and then I was laid off shortly after.  Thanks South Dakota.
