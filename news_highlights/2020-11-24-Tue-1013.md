> "On such matters they would never protest; they are incapable of moving outside of their own little world of interests."

"A free people is a people that remembers, is able to own its history rather than deny it, and learns its best lessons," he said.

## The world’s largest maker of latex gloves to close more than half its factories after over 2500 employees test positive for COVID

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55053846):

> There have been concerns about the working conditions of the low-paid migrant workers it relies upon. In September migrant workers told the Los Angeles Times about difficult working conditions at Top Glove factories, describing 72-hour work weeks, cramped living conditions and low wages. "These workers are vulnerable because they live and work in congested shared quarters and do work that does not make it possible to practice strict social distancing," she told the BBC. "During these times employers have a huge responsibility towards them but we are hearing of cases where they are not providing workers with sufficient food or even withholding their wages," she added.

Beginning in September, Mrs. Meda taught nursing students at Collin College as well as high school students earning dual-credit. Collin College District President Neil Matkin released a statement to NBC 5 on Meda's passing, stating: "On behalf of our Board of Trustees, students, faculty and staff, we extend our deepest condolences to the Meda family. Professor Meda's family shared that she was honored to serve as an instructor at Collin College, and we are sincerely grateful for her service to our students."

> So the lesson from things like this is that qualified front-line health care providers should just quit, or not rejoin the workforce.
> 
> I don't know if anyone is collecting data on this, but anecdotally, some are quitting. Many are being stressed to their breaking points, or to the point of making errors under stress.
> 
> Meanwhile the number of infections is rising nearly exponentially.
> 
> This is a really, really bad recipe for our near future.

## ‘We’re drowning’: COVID cases flood hospitals in America’s heartland

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-hospitals/were-drowning-covid-cases-flood-hospitals-in-americas-heartland-idUSKBN2841K3):

> Miller, Kearny's chief medical officer - who doubles as the county health officer - called around to larger hospitals in search of an ICU bed. According to Reuters' interviews with more than a dozen medical care providers and public health officials in the nation's heartland, many hospitals are severely lacking in beds, equipment and - most critically - clinical staff, including specialists and nurses. Mary Helland, a chief nursing officer with CommonSpirit Health in North Dakota, said she has put in requests for traveling nurses for the 11 critical access hospitals she oversees in North Dakota and Minnesota.

`/u/ShackToPortland` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k0533z/were_drowning_covid_cases_flood_hospitals_in/):

> We need to stop with this “heartland” BS. It’s part of the whole false narrative that the “real America” is in the Midwest. From the Electoral College to the media, we are obsessed with a minority of Americans who have somehow been deemed to be the “true” Americans. Do we really think a bunch of white racists who can’t handle wearing a mask and think Covid is a hoax represent the heart of the country? Really?
