> This is the same police chief who says he still hasn't seen the video of his officer shooting someone.  He's seems to take pride in being professionally ignorant.

## Ben Shapiro loses free speech lawsuit against UMN over venue change

Summary of [original article](https://www.mndaily.com/article/2020/08/ben-shapiro-loses-free-speech-lawsuit-against-umn-over-venue-change):

> A judge determined Friday that University of Minnesota officials were driven by safety concerns in conservative speaker Ben Shapiro's freedom of speech lawsuit, according to the Pioneer Press. Shapiro and the groups that sponsored his campus visit - Young America's Foundation and Students for a Conservative Voice - filed a lawsuit in July 2018, alleging that the University held the event on a smaller venue on the St. Paul campus instead of a larger venue on the Minneapolis campus due to political bias. "As a result of the forced relocation to the [North Star] Ballroom, many students were prevented from attending and participating in the speaking event, and Shapiro was forced to speak to less than half the number of students that desired to attend," read the lawsuit.

> A big loss for Ben, for sure.  Going to be hard for him to go home and look his full-length, cardboard cutout of AOC in the eye.

## Officer charged in George Floyd's death argues drug overdose killed him, not knee on neck

Summary of [original article](https://abcn.ws/31EptpR):

> A defense attorney for the fired Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in connection with the death of George Floyd is asking a judge to drop all charges, arguing the 46-year-old man's death was allegedly from a drug overdose and not caused by the officer planting his knee in the back of Floyd's neck. "Put simply, Mr. Floyd could not breathe because he had ingested a lethal dose of fentanyl and, possibly, a speedball. Combined with sickle cell trait, his pre-existing heart conditions, Mr. Floyd's use of fentanyl and methamphetamine most likely killed him," Nelson argued. "Despite Mr. Floyd's pleas that he could not breathe and was going to die, as well as the pleas of eyewitnesses to get off Mr. Floyd and help him, Defendant and his co-defendants continued to restrain Mr. Floyd."

`/u/SleepyOnGrace` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ijjgac/officer_charged_in_george_floyds_death_argues/):

> The defense is going to argue the following--please note I'm just laying out their angle for reasonable doubt, not endorsing it, cause I'm *not*. I think there's one really weak spot in it I'll get to later but anyway:
> 
> The argument will go like this, and will involve the *much*  longer bodycam video which came out later (1) Floyd had a ridiculously high amount of fent in his system as revealed by the toxicology report, (2) one symptom of fent overdose is fluid in the lungs and Floyd did have massive fluid build up in  his lungs according to the autopsies,(3)  he was shouting "I can't breathe" before a single hand was laid upon him, (4) the attempt by the cops to call an EMT for Floyd demonstrates they were concerned with is well-being, which means they did not show active malice towards Floyd which is what you need for Murder 2,  (5) Floyd was in a state of "excited delerium" where he could've been dangerous to others or himself (6) that the MPD specifically trains officers to use a neck immobolization tactic when dealing with a suspect in this state, and (7) that the knee could at worst only cut off one of his arteries--which leaves the artery on the other side of the neck free to pass blood to the brain.
> 
> The biggest hole in this defense is that "excited delerium" is not recognized by the medical profession as a thing--but the case is not a slam dunk especially as it's Murder 2 and in particular it's not a slam dunk for the other two cops besides Chauvin.
> 
> Remember, all the defense has to show is reasonable doubt as to whether or not they killed Floyd with active malice.

## Suit by protester kicked by officer heading to federal court

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/71ee79a32ee99bb02059783dc630f810):

> ERIE, Pa. - A lawsuit filed by a protester seen on video being kicked by a police officer during civil unrest in the northwestern Pennsylvania city of Erie is likely on its way to federal court rather than county court, attorneys said. The Erie Times-News reports that Erie attorneys said in a petition filed last week that the case belongs in federal court since it alleges violation of protester Hannah Silbaugh's constitutional rights regarding unreasonable seizure, substantive due process and excessive force. Silbaugh filed an internal affairs complaint alleging that the officer assaulted her by kicking her.

> I hadn't seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbheRWZq0DQ), but it's pretty shitty. Obviously everyone's being required to move, but she's just sitting there holding her head like "*Hey, don't hurt me I'm no threat - just scared.*" and rather than remove her from the area he's like, "*nah*" \**punt*\* -- there was no excuse for it.
> 
> I think the officers that do this know they're the problem, and I think they like that.

## Kenosha police arrest volunteers who provide food to protesters

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kenosha-police-arrest-volunteers-who-provide-food-protesters-n1238799):

> Nine people arrested by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, for allegedly being outside agitators were in town city to distribute food to protesters, a director of the nonprofit kitchen said Saturday. Jennifer Scheurle, who serves on the board of directors for Riot Kitchen, based in Seattle, said Kenosha police were mistaken when they arrested the volunteers Wednesday for investigation of disorderly conduct. The driver of the minivan "Attempted to drive away," Kenosha police said, and when officers caught up with it, they "Forced entry." In video posted to social media and shared by Scheurle, police are seen breaking a minivan window after one officer shouts, "Get the [expletive] out."

> They can arrest people handing out food but let a murderer walk right past them with his hands raised in the air carrying an AR15. It goes to show you the police priorities and Trump's priorities are totally ass backwards.

## Progressive community leaders call for Portland mayor, police chief to resign following deadly shooting

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/progressive-community-leaders-call-for-portland-mayor-to-resign-following-deadly-shooting.html):

> A group of leaders representing various progressive organizations from across the Portland area have called for the resignations of Mayor Ted Wheeler and Police Chief Chuck Lovell in the wake of Saturday's fatal shooting. The demand for Wheeler to resign was also echoed in a joint letter from the Oregon chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Oregon Justice Resource Center, the Portland Democratic Socialists of America NextUp Action Fund, Portland's Resistance and Popular Mobilization PDX."What took place last night was inevitable given Mayor Wheeler's repeated failure," the letter said. Portland police on Saturday diverted vehicles participating in a pro-Trump caravan toward Interstate 5 near the Hawthorne Bridge while keeping counter demonstrators off the road. Some cars and trucks began zooming past the police barricade after some time, heading into downtown Portland.
