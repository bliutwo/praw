## Michigan man jailed for nearly 4 decades exonerated after witness admits to lying

Summary of [original article](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/12/14/jackson-michigan-walter-forbes-exonerated-4-decades-prison/3841099001/):

> The damage the gunshot did to Forbes' body may have taken a few months to heal, but what happened next led to him spending nearly four decades in prison, leaving deep lifelong wounds on him and his family. Forbes, 63, became a free man on Nov. 20, more than 37 years following his conviction, after the prosecution's star witness admitted to fabricating her story and evidence surfaced that the fire may have been part of an insurance fraud scheme orchestrated by the Maple Street building owner, leading to a retrial, according to documents filed in Jackson County Circuit Court. Forbes said upon his release, his thoughts were directed toward the prisoners of Kinross Correctional Facility, the last of about a dozen facilities he was imprisoned at and where as of Dec. 4 there were over 1,000 active positive coronavirus cases, according to Michigan Department of Corrections data.

> 40 years in prison because a building owner torched his place, and killed one of his tenants. "exonerated" never did it mean so little.

> Shortly after 9 a.m., the new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was administered in Queens, the first known inoculation since the vaccine was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration late last week. According to Gen. Gustave F. Perna, the chief operating officer of the federal effort to develop a vaccine, 145 sites were set to receive the vaccine on Monday, 425 on Tuesday and 66 on Wednesday. The grim notice, on the same day as the vaccine's much-anticipated rollout in the United States, was a somber reminder of the coronavirus's resurgence in New York, where tens of thousands more people are expected to be infected until the vaccine is widely available next year.

## U.S. Supreme Court rejects bid to revive Kansas voting restriction

Summary of [original article](https://news.trust.org/item/20201214135636-p6542/):

> WASHINGTON, Dec 14 - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by Kansas to revive a restrictive Republican-backed law that required documentation of citizenship for voter registration - a measure struck down by lower courts for disenfranchising qualified voters. The Supreme Court in 2008 upheld laws that require people to show a photo identification card when voting. The court rejected the Kansas appeal three days after acting in a major voting case, with the justices on Friday rebuffing a lawsuit filed by Texas and backed by Trump seeking to throw out voting results in four states - a likely fatal blow to his quest to undo his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden.

> >In 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson found that the law "disproportionately impacted duly qualified registration applicants, while only nominally preventing non-citizen voter registration."
> 
> Kris Kobach put together a program that looked at voter registrations in different states.  If two states had registrations where people had the same first name, same last name, and same date of birth, it would determine that those were the same person and Republicans would use it as an excuse to strike both people from voter rolls.

## The number of people with the virus who died in the U.S. passes 300,000.

> 
> In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration launched a $200-million pandemic early-warning program called PREDICT, which trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories to stop and prevent pandemics. This initiative identified 1,200 different viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, [including more than 160](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus) novel coronaviruses. 
> 
> The labs they worked with included the Wuhan lab that identified Covid19.
> 
> This is the initiative that [put a stop to viruses](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-trump-pandemic-program-viruses-detection
> ) before they became pandemics. They warned airports and health agencies. They initiated contact tracing and identification. They were the ones who stopped pandemics hundreds of times in the past 10 years, and were doing it right up until September. 
> 
> In September, the Trump administration ended this $200-million pandemic early-warning program.
> 
> This program is what would have shut down air traffic the moment the first case was discovered in [November in China](https://www.livescience.com/first-case-coronavirus-found.html). Per protocol, these are the people who would have initiated travel advisories, alerted Customs and Border Protection, and traced every person with the virus who was coming to America. This would have cost some money, but it was doable.
> 
> By [December 13th](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-12-01-20-intl/h_5e4e8b4b5f8f0b44c5286c5f05b483bb), the first infections started coming to America.

> I am in weekly meetings with Federal Protective Services. Their most popular deployment is Mardi Gras, where dozens of agents all volunteer to go down to protect the event. FPS explained that during Mardi Gras, people were coming into the hospitals with flu-like symptoms, being tested and found negative for flu, and [were released into the public where they kept partying](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_dedfb5e4-7c2a-11ea-901f-6720fa25be5a.html). 
> 
> The PREDICT program would have put all of the hospitals in America on high alert. Instead, hospitals were releasing people into the public without any warning.
> 
> It took four months of Trump calling it [a hoax](https://doggett.house.gov/media-center/blog-posts/timeline-trump-s-coronavirus-responses) before any public response was made.
> 
> Trump is DIRECTLY responsible for the spread of coronavirus. If he had not shut down the PREDICT program, this would not have happened. I mean, it *could* be a coincidence that we had no pandemics in the past 10 years, then the very month Trump shut down the program, a pandemic started spreading, but you'd have to be a Trump supporter to believe that.

## Russian FSB hit squad poisoned Alexei Navalny, report says

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/russian-fsb-hit-squad-poisoned-alexei-navalny-report-says):

> An undercover hit squad working for Russia's FSB spy agency poisoned the opposition activist Alexei Navalny in August, after shadowing him on multiple previous trips, the investigative website Bellingcat has claimed. Eight members of the Navalny hit squad were based at the institute, Bellingcat said, citing mobile phone tower data. The Navalny hit squad used burner phones, Bellingcat reported, but sometimes alongside regular phones, which were trackable.
