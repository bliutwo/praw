> Listening to a live briefing from "Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin and FBI" a few minutes ago - they said to expect the investigations to not be finished in days, weeks, or even months. And that we will have "hundreds" of criminal cases.
> 
> They aim to open cases as quickly as possible, which is why you see so many "light" criminal charges (misdemeanors, etc) being brought, and after those charges are brought they have the ability to indict them on more significant charges later... we're seeing that happen already. But they're actively looking at significant felony charges tied to sedition and conspiracy.
> 
> Also said "I think there are a lot of misconceptions about what happened inside the capitol and its going to come into laser focus over the next weeks and days".
