## Underage girl forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, US court document claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/31/underage-girl-forced-to-have-sex-with-prince-andrew-us-court-document-jeffrey-epstein):

> The sex offender Jeffrey Epstein allegedly tried to gather incriminating material against Prince Andrew by forcing an underage girl to have sex with him, according to newly released court documents. A friend of Prince Andrew said: "The US federal appeals court said in 2019 these allegations should be treated with 'extreme caution'. Allegations are not the same as facts, which is the essential premise on which justice works. Let's see if these allegations stand up, because precious few about the duke do - where's the proof?". Similar allegations about Prince Andrew having sex with an underage girl were ordered to be struck from court records in 2015 in the civil case.

> This was Epstein's game; produce as much blackmail material on as many powerful people as possible. That was one of the ways he obsessively protected himself and got leverage over people. I wouldn't be shocked if at some point there had been photo evidence.   
> 
> 
> It seems like everyone thinks Andrew is guilty, I wonder when it will become bad enough for something to be done.
