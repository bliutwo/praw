> When other states banned dog racing, there were tidal waves of former racing greyhounds needing homes. As far as I know there are no publicly available records that show the number of dogs that owners put down - instead of holding on to them and making arrangements with greyhound rescues. I suspect it's a lot.
> 
> Former racing greyhounds make great pets. I have fostered a bunch of them. They are pretty unique. Their bodies have been bred for one purpose (racing) so they have very light bones. deep chests and long tails, which can act as a kind of rudder at high speeds. Behaviorally, these are adult dogs, who - save for exercise a couple of times per day, and occasional races  - have always lived in crates. So it takes time for them to adjust to 'normal' home life'.
> 
> Typical challenges for them when they are re-homed include stairs (most have never seen them), smooth floors, etc. Also, having probably only ever seen other greyhounds, they often do not seem to recognize other breeds as dogs. Unsurprisingly, they tend to have off the chart prey drive, which doesn't usually go away. After a month or two, they adjust, and earn their nickname of '40 mile per hour couch potatoes'.

> I lived in a neighborhood where 'the folks" prided themselves on having boat loads of loud fireworks, the closer to actual dynamite the better. 
> 
> Well one year they went all out. Loud, Louder, and Even Louder was the theme. Until an elderly year old woman came out of her apartment hysterical.. begging for them to stop. You see the fireworks triggered an episode - her husband fought in WWII and was now in a full mental relapse/breakdown because he thought the neighborhood was being bombed by the Germans. 
> 
> They stopped - finally realizing their actions have an impact beyond their own wants/needs.

>  “CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday the forgiveness and expungement of about 500,000 criminal cannabis cases."
> 
> “Pritzker said he issued pardons for 9,210 low-level cannabis convictions, while Illinois State Police have wiped clean more than 492,000 non-felony cannabis-related arrest records.”
> 
> “The actions by Pritzker and state police is mandated by the Illinois law that legalized the licensed sale of marijuana starting in 2020. The intent of the law is to reduce the impact of the war on drugs on minorities, who were disproportionately arrested and locked up for cannabis crimes”
> 
> “We will never be able to fully remedy the depth of that damage,” Pritzker said. “But we can govern with the courage to admit the mistakes of our past and the decency to set a better path forward.
> __________________________________________________________________
> 
> "State Sen. Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Maywood, applauded the expungement and pardons, but said it was only a small step forward."
> 
> “As we near the end of the first year of Illinois’ new legal cannabis industry, I am heartened by the progress we have made towards undoing the harms dealt by the failed war on drugs,” Toi Hutchinson, senior advisor to the governor for cannabis control, said in a statement"
> 
> "Hutchinson added that none of the other 11 states that have legalized recreational cannabis have taken the step Illinois has taken, by removing low-level and non-violent cannabis-related arrest records."
> 
> “Dismantling decades’ worth of criminal justice atrocities will take years. That’s evidenced by how this country handles cannabis,” Lightford said. “We must never stop chipping away at that painful history. I’m proud of these critical first steps.”

## Adobe Flash Player is finally laid to rest

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55497353):

> In April 2010, Apple's Steve Jobs wrote a blistering open letter headlined Thoughts On Flash, in which he laid out why Apple would not let Flash run on iPhones and iPads. Big brands such as Facebook, Netflix and YouTube were already streaming videos to smartphones without Flash and in November 2011 Adobe ended development of Flash for mobile devices. Since Adobe will prevent Flash Player from displaying content from 12 January, there are concerns that years of animations, games and interactive websites will be lost.

`/u/fxds67` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ko6bhh/adobe_flash_player_is_finally_laid_to_rest/):

> Thank you, Jonathan Gay.  For all of its problems, Flash addressed a very real need nearly twenty years before open standards got around to really replacing it, and it fundamentally allowed the web to usefully move forward.  Gay deserves more credit than he's received as one of the giants who made the Internet into the cultural force it has become.
> 
> Also, I'm still kicking myself for just sitting there in my dorm room playing Dark Castle and never walking across the street to knock on the door of his dorm room to say thank you.  So again, if by some strange chance Jonathan Gay ever reads this, thank you.

## Danny Masterson harassment suit must go through Scientology mediation, judge rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/danny-masterson-harassment-suit-must-go-through-scientology-mediation-judge-n1252635):

> LOS ANGELES - The stalking and intimidation cases brought by four women who have accused TV actor Danny Masterson of rape must now go through mediation within the Church of Scientology, a Los Angeles judge ruled Wednesday. In early November, that hearing was set for Jan 6.On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Steven Kleifield ruled that the harassment complaint from Chrissie Carnell Bixler, her husband, musician Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marie Bobette Riales and two Jane Does must be settled by the Church in "Religious arbitration," since an arbitration agreement already exists among the parties that compels disputes to be handled by the Church of Scientology. Jane Doe #1 also alleged harassment by property damage, threats of violence, assaults and sexual harassment as retribution for reporting her alleged rape to police.
