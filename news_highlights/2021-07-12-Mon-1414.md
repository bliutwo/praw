That got put up before we opened, and I didn't think anybody was going to notice it, because we did just one sign and then it went pretty crazy on Facebook. I got a call from my upper management and they told me I needed to take it down."

## Jamaica plans to seek reparations from Britain over slavery

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/jamaica-plans-seek-reparations-britain-over-slavery-2021-07-12/?taid=60ec6a8dbcdfda0001965879&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter&utm_source=reddit.com):

> Keir Gravil via REUTERS.KINGSTON, July 12 - Jamaica plans to ask Britain for compensation for the Atlantic slave trade in the former British colony, a senior government official said, under a petition that could seek billions of pounds in reparations. An estimated 600,000 Africans were shipped to toil in Jamaica, according to the National Library of Jamaica. Britain prohibited trade in slaves in its empire in 1807 but did not formally abolish the practice of slavery until 1834.To compensate slave owners, the British government took out a 20 million pound loan - a very large sum at the time - and only finished paying off the ensuing interest payments in 2015.The reparations petition is based on a private motion by Jamaican lawmaker Mike Henry, who said it was worth some 7.6 billion pounds, a sum he estimated is roughly equivalent in today's terms to what Britain paid to the slaveholders.

> Fun fact about Caribbean reparations: Haiti was forced to pay reparations to France for lost property (slaves that broke free in 1804). They had to pay these reparations until 1947.

## The Army is investigating a married officer accused of faking deployments and awards amid affairs with several women

Summary of [original article](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-officer-affairs-women/):

> Richard Kane Mansir, a civil affairs officer based at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, has had "Serious, long-term relationships" with at least six other women over the last five years, while still married to his wife of 18 years, according to a Daily Beast report. Sharon Mulligan, a spokesperson for the Center for Initial Military Training at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, told Army Times that the Army "Is aware of and investigating the allegations against Lt. Col. Mansir." The Daily Beast reported that Mansir has also been suspended amid the investigation. Curnutt, Mansir's wife, and the woman who was engaged to Mansir in 2017 began working together to untangle all of Mansir's lies, according to the Daily Beast report, finding that he was apparently having serious relationships with at least four other women over the last five years and that he "Had a habit of dating Army subordinates and widows of men who died in combat-women who'd be too embarrassed to say anything about it, or whose careers would be ruined if they did."
