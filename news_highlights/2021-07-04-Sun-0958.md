## Nurse who received first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine will have her scrubs and vaccine card displayed in Smithsonian

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smithsonian-nurse-covid-19-vaccine-scrubs/):

> President Biden announced on Friday that Lindsay, who was the first person in the nation to receive an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, will have her hospital scrubs, vaccination card and the badge she wore on the day she received her first dose displayed at the COVID-19 exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum of American History. "Over the past, and I don't believe this, 30 years - she doesn't look 30 years old - she's pursued her dream of becoming a nurse to allow her to do what she wanted to do most, give back to her new country," Mr. Biden said on Friday. As of Friday, more than 327 million vaccine doses have been administered, according to Johns Hopkins, but just 17 states have fully vaccinated more than half of their population.

## Hate symbols graffitied on Martin Luther King Jr. statue in Central Long Beach

Summary of [original article](https://lbpost.com/news/hate-symbols-graffitied-on-martin-luther-king-jr-statue-in-central-long-beach):

> Symbols resembling a swastika and SS bolts that were worn by some Nazi troops during World War II were graffitied onto a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. in Central Long Beach Friday afternoon. Authorities were notified about the hate-motivated symbols on the front of the statue in Martin Luther King Jr. Park on Friday at about 3:18 p.m. "The incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime and there are currently no suspects nor suspect information available," Richard Mejia, an LBPD spokesman, said in an email. Pastor Gregory Sanders, who grew up two streets away from the park and remembered when it was originally named 19th Street Park, said he's never seen this level of hate graffitied onto the statue of King.
