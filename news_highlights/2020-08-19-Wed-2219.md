> Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday that he had authorized the city to disconnect utility service at a Hollywood Hills house after it hosted several large parties in "Flagrant violation" of COVID-19 public health orders. The announcement comes two weeks after Garcetti first warned that properties hosting "Un-permitted large gatherings" could have their water and power service shut off as a consequence. According to the mayor's office, the Hollywood Hills house hosted a large gathering on Aug. 8, three days after the threat of utility shutoffs was first announced.

## QAnon groups hit by Facebook crack down

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-hit-facebook-crack-down-n1237330):

> Facebook on Wednesday banned about 900 pages and groups and 1,500 ads tied to the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, part of a sweeping action that also restricted the reach of over 10,000 Instagram pages and almost 2,000 Facebook groups pushing the baseless conspiracy theory that has spawned real-world violence. Facebook also took down thousands of accounts, pages and groups as part of what they called a "Policy expansion," seeking to limit violent rhetoric tied to QAnon, political militias and protest groups like antifa. Facebook will now downrank QAnon, militia and anarchist protest groups on users' News Feeds and in Facebook and Instagram's search engines.

> It's very hard to wrap my brain around some of shit these people believe. They should be committed to a mental hospital. And yet some of them are going being elected to positions in government. You should be disqualified from public service if you believe in something as dangerous as this.
