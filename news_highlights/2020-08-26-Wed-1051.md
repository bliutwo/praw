Asbury Park Police Officer Stephen Martinsen, 31, and former SLEO-2 Thomas Dowling, 27, both of Asbury Park, pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal mischief and as part of their plea deals they must forfeit any future public employment in the state, according to a statement from Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher J. Gramiccioni. Mignoli, 70, had filed an administrative complaint against both officers several days before the incidents.

## REPORT: Shots fired in Kenosha during protests [VIDEO]

Summary of [original article](https://wtmj.com/news/2020/08/26/report-shots-fired-during-in-kenosha-during-protests-video/):

> KENOSHA - For the third night in-a-row, protests in Kenosha are becoming violent. According to TMJ4's Tony Atkins, shots were fired near 60th and Sheridan.

`/u/baconatorX` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/igt27d/report_shots_fired_in_kenosha_during_protests/):

> EDIT: I believe I have the sequence backwards. It seems to make more sense that the head shot is the first shoot, then the gunman runs away being chased by the group. Members of the group can be heard saying "why did you shoot that guy" just before chasing the gunman and the gunman tripping and the other shooting event occuring. 
> 
> So far this is the best sequence of videos I have seen. NSFW. I don't know why the guy is running in the initial video.

> 
> Edit 3, Adding more footage to the top level comment. This is the aftermath of the man shot in the arm. He's very lucky to have a tourniquet on. https://streamable.com/808vln
> 
> I would like to point out that there are clearly multiple different guns going off throughout these videos so I'd say it's going to take quite awhile to figure out exactly what went down aside from the very clear shooting shown on video.
> 
> Edit: I'm going add a video which contains interviews with the alleged shooter before the shooting event. I will add it to a lower reply comment in case the mods want to remove it for some reason. This guy looks like a kid.
> 
> Edit: here's a clip with more footage before and after shown from the same camera that "edit 2" angle two has. It includes footage of the shooter running towards police. https://mobile.twitter.com/Kreap_Official/status/1298509888822288384
> 
> Edit: AndyNGO sparks a lot of anger but he's quoting an Instagram post. He's showing the guy who had his arm shot with a pistol in hand. It's hard for me to imagine the arm guy was able to draw his gun after getting shot and it's hard for me to imagine him going in for a melee fight vs a rifle when his pistol was an option. Very odd situation. I can't say I saw anything in his hand during the altercation in other footage.  https://mobile.twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1298529196549869568
> 
> Edit: here's high res pictures of the shooting incident including the arm guy, it appears the arm guy pulled his pistol after what appears to be a fake surrender. When watching on full speed video it's a very fast sequence of events and it could very likely be just an impulse reaction throwing his hands up due to gunshot noise rather than a surrender. https://imgur.com/a/ewE87IQ
> 
> Edit: here's earlier footage of various confrontations between some of the folks that got shot and some "militia" I didn't see the alleged shooter tm here though. https://mobile.twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1298474730966659072
