## The National Rifle Association cannot use bankruptcy to reorganize in gun-friendly Texas, a federal judge in Dallas ruled on Tuesday, handing a defeat to the influential firearms rights group that is facing an effort to dissolve it in New York state

Summary of [original article](https://news.trust.org/item/20210511181533-nqv5i/):

> May 11 - The National Rifle Association cannot use bankruptcy to reorganize in gun-friendly Texas, a federal judge in Dallas ruled on Tuesday, handing a defeat to the influential firearms rights group that is facing an effort to dissolve it in New York state. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale's decision, following a trial over the legitimacy of the NRA's January bankruptcy filing, means the group will remain incorporated in New York. "The question the court is faced with is whether the existential threat facing the NRA is the type of threat that the Bankruptcy Code is meant to protect against," Hale wrote.

> LaPierre put the NRA through bankruptcy apparently without the board's approval or even knowledge.  Which seems like, from a corporate governance perspective, a big fucking deal.  I can't imagine that, in a rational organization, any CEO that committed an action that big and that would affect that many shareholders would be allowed to stay on for more than a minute after that bankruptcy filing was submitted.

## U.S. official says Covid booster shots will also be free to the public

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/us-official-says-covid-booster-shots-will-also-be-free-to-the-public-.html):

> Covid-19 booster shots will be free to the public if they are needed to control the ongoing pandemic, White House Covid-19 Response Team Chief Science Officer David Kessler told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday. If booster shots are deemed necessary by federal health officials, seniors and people with underlying conditions would likely be the first to have access to them, as they did during the first round of vaccines. The Moderna booster shot already shows promising results against the B.1.

> I hope they made it affordable this time. I remember in grad school how I was so excited to have "affordable" healthcare as an unemployed student with multiple preexisting conditions, only to find out the rates were still fucked. My only option was $266/mo. with a $3,000 yearly deductible. A single doctor visit plus bloodwork (which I need frequently) was $200. An MRI (which I need yearly) was $599. All after insurance applied. Until the government forces lower rates the Act won't be as effective as it should be.
> 
> I've since moved to Japan where the health insurance rate is a fixed percentage of income with no deductibles. A doctor's visit with bloodwork runs $40 and an MRI $60. My most expensive procedures, colonoscopy and CT scan, weren't much higher than $100. *That* is affordable healthcare.

## Jeff Bezos buys $500m superyacht so big it comes with a â€˜support yachtâ€™

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/jeff-bezos-amazon-superyacht-pandemic-b1845278.html):

> While the details of the vessel have largely been kept under wrap, the 417-foot superyacht is so massive that it has a yacht of its own, along with a helipad, reported Bloomberg. Amazon's stocks gained 75 per cent last year as consumers turned towards its services for shopping during the pandemic, reported CNN. Bezos isn't the only billionaire to have gained fortune during the pandemic. Aino Grapin, chief executive officer of superyacht interiors studio Winch Design, told the outlet that the yacht allows the explorer to cruise for 9,000 nautical miles without the need to refuel it.

## Alabama police officer convicted of murder still gets paid

Summary of [original article](https://www.wbrz.com/news/alabama-officer-convicted-of-murder-still-gets-paid):

> HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - An Alabama police officer convicted of murder for shooting a suicidal man who was holding a gun to his own head has been taken off duty but will continue to be paid, the city of Huntsville said. Officer William Darby, who was initially placed on desk duty following the killing of Jeffrey Parker in 2018, can't continue working as an officer because of the conviction and went on leave Monday, city spokeswoman Lucy DeButy told news outlets. While Mayor Tommy Battle, a Republican, and Police Chief Mark McMurray have disagreed publicly with the jurors' decision, Alabama Democratic Party executive director Wade Perry criticized the city's move to keep paying Darby.
