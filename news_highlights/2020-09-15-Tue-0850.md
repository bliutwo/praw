## Ice detainees faced medical neglect and hysterectomies, whistleblower alleges

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/14/ice-detainees-hysterectomies-medical-neglect-irwin-georgia):

> Immigrants in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Georgia are being subjected to horrific conditions and treatment, including "Jarring medical neglect" and a high rate of hysterectomies among women, according to a whistleblower complaint filed by several legal advocacy groups on behalf of a nurse who works there. According to the new complaint, Wooten reported an alarmingly high rate of hysterectomies - a surgery in which part or all of the uterus is removed - being performed on Spanish-speaking immigrants, many of whom did not appear to understand why they had undergone the procedure. Project South, one of the human rights groups that filed the complaint, had previously filed a report in 2017 regarding Irwin's poor treatment of detainees, including unsanitary conditions, inedible food and refusing medical care to detainees.

## Spiking U.S. gun sales deluge FBI's background check system, cause delays

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-fbi/spiking-u-s-gun-sales-deluge-fbis-background-check-system-cause-delays-idUSKBN26622A):

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - A surge in people buying guns since the coronavirus pandemic began has flooded the FBI's background check system, causing a spike in the number of delayed checks and allowing gun sales to proceed without them, FBI data disclosed on Tuesday showed. If an FBI background check takes longer than three business days, a gun dealer can sell the firearm to a buyer, under current regulations. When asked in April about the spike in background checks caused by increased gun sales, the FBI said its system was "Operational and will continue to process requests."

From tackling pollution to protecting coral reefs, the international community did not fully achieve any of the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets agreed in Japan in 2010 to slow the loss of the natural world. Now the UN has reported that the world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems.
