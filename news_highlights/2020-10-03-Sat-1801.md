## Patriots' Cam Newton heading to COVID-19 reserve list after reportedly testing positive, will not face Chiefs

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/patriots-cam-newton-heading-to-covid-19-reserve-list-after-reportedly-testing-positive-will-not-face-chiefs/):

> On Saturday morning, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that New England Patriots quarterback Cam Newton tested positive for the coronavirus, and will miss Sunday's matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs. "Late last night, we received notice that a Patriots player tested positive for COVID-19. The player immediately entered self-quarantine. Several additional players, coaches and staff who have been in close contact with the player received point of care tests this morning and all were negative for COVID-19.". As CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones notes, if a player tests positive and shows not symptoms, he cannot return unless and until 10 days have passed since the initial positive test or five days have passed since the initial positive test and two consecutive negative PCR virus tests are registered separated by 24 hours.

> The NHL and NBA have done it right. No positive cases after the bubble was formed. It's actually very impressive. Its shocking how bad the other leagues have done.

## Andrew Yang takes lead in California data privacy measure

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-data-privacy-san-francisco-campaigns-andrew-yang-724d9f173c37669257cbe7f0037aeed3):

> SAN FRANCISCO - The Fitbits on our wrists collect our health and fitness data; Apple promises privacy but lots of iPhone apps can still share our personal information; and who really knows what they're agreeing to when a website asks, "Do You Accept All Cookies?" Most people just click "OK" and hope for the best, says former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang."The amount of data we're giving up is unprecedented in human history," says Yang, who lives in New York but is helping lead the campaign for a data privacy initiative on California's Nov. 3 ballot. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 would expand the rights Californians were given to their personal data in a groundbreaking law approved two years ago, which took effect in January. Proposition 24 would also create the California Privacy Protection Agency, with an annual budget of $10 million, to enforce the law and fine companies for violations.

`/u/skeebidybop` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/j4oae3/andrew_yang_takes_lead_in_california_data_privacy/):

> To my surprise the ACLU is opposed to this law/
> 
> > The ACLU of Northern California is also opposed, saying some updates would actually hurt consumers.
> 
> >”Overall, it is a step backward for privacy in California,” said Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. He argues Proposition 24 would make it easier for businesses to charge customers higher prices — or “pay for privacy” — if they refuse the collection of their data, or downgrade service for those who don’t pay the fee, which could hurt low-income communities and those who can’t pay to protect themselves.
> 
> >”That’s not how privacy should work. It should not be a luxury that only rich people can afford,” he said.
> 
> Anyone knowledgeable want to chime in on this?
> 
> Edit - I’m also curious to hear more about how this compares to the GDPR

## Emmett-Caldwell football game canceled at halftime after activist Ammon Bundy refuses to wear mask

Summary of [original article](https://scorebooklive.com/idaho/2020/10/02/emmett-caldwell-football-game-canceled-at-halftime-after-ammon-bundy-refuses-to-wear-mask/):

> An Idaho high school football game between Emmett and Caldwell was canceled at halftime on Friday night after an incident with Ammon Bundy. Bundy, an anti-government agitator who led the 2016 armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Center, refused to wear a mask upon entering the game at Caldwell High School. In a video of the incident posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, Emmett coaches walked over at halftime after being made aware of the situation and tried to reason with Bundy.

`/u/Account_3_0` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/j4l9kk/emmettcaldwell_football_game_canceled_at_halftime/):

> > When he again refused, **after please**  from Emmett coaches, Caldwell administrators canceled the game at half with Emmett leading 35-0.
> 
> 
> Someone doesn’t know that pleas is the plural of plea.  
> 
> 
> > When the school’s principal asked police to arrest Bundy, officers refused, telling the station he “wasn’t out of control and didn’t appear to be a threat to anybody.”
> 
> Fuck that. It’s trespassing no matter how polite he may be.
