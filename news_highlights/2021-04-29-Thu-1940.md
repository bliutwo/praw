## Alabama governor signs bill to remove anti-gay language from sex education curriculum

Summary of [original article](https://www.metroweekly.com/2021/04/alabama-governor-signs-bill-to-remove-anti-gay-language-from-sex-education-curriculum/):

> Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has signed a bill into law reforming Alabama's sex education standards and removing anti-LGBTQ language from the curriculum that previously required teachers to condemn homosexuality and portray it in a negative light. Hall told the Alabama Media Group in March that she downplayed the removal of the condemnation of homosexuality and focused arguments in favor of the bill on making the sex ed curriculum age-appropriate and scientifically accurate, fearing that the Republican majority might derail the bill if it focused to much on its LGBTQ aspects. "Since 1992, state law. has required that when sex education is taught in Alabama schools the instruction include language targeting 'the homosexual lifestyle' as illegal and immoral. This language is not only legally inaccurate, it encouraged further stigmatization and isolation of LGBTQ students," the SPLC said in a statement.

> > [The bill] removes a requirement that teachers must emphasize to their students, using precise language, that “homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state”
> 
> It is so wrong that teachers were *required* to teach that homosexuality is not an acceptable lifestyle before this bill was passed, but good on Alabama for doing the right thing and striking this terrible, asinine requirement.
