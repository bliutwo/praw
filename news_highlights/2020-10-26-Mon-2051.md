Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmation.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.google.chrome.ios.ShareExtension):

> A divided Senate on Monday voted to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to a lifetime term on the Supreme Court, capping a bitter fight over the partisan makeup of the judicial body, which has taken place in the middle of an unusually explosive presidential election. Barrett passed a key procedural vote from the full Senate on Sunday in a 51-48 vote in which no Democrat voted in her favor. On Monday Murkowski voted to confirm Barrett, after her largely symbolic vote the day before.

## Family sues Texas county for wrongful death of Black man during 'Live PD' production

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-sues-texas-county-wrongful-death-black-man-during-live-n1244813):

> The family of a Black man who died after a car chase with deputies accompanied by a reality television camera crew filed a lawsuit against Williamson County, Texas, where a sheriff is already facing tampering charges in the case. The family of Javier Ambler filed suit on Sunday under the state's Wrongful Death Act, alleging that sheriff's deputies engaged in a reckless chase of Ambler in order to make entertaining television for "Live PD," the lawsuit said. "Sheriff Chody's permissive chase policy, and his policy of allowing Live PD to film policing activities as 'entertainment,' encouraged Johnson to chase Ambler for this trivial offense," the lawsuit said.

## Large corporate landlords have filed 10,000 eviction actions in five states since September

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/large-corporate-landlords-have-filed-10-000-eviction-actions-five-n1244711):

> From early September to Oct. 17, despite the CDC eviction ban, almost 10,000 eviction actions have been filed in 23 counties in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas by large corporate landlords like the one that owns Velez's house, court documents show. Court records show 122 eviction filings by Invitation Homes in the five states during the period. Velez's eviction action is one of 97 cases filed against tenants by Progress Residential since the CDC announced its ban.

`/u/ProbablyHighAsShit` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jiiqsw/large_corporate_landlords_have_filed_10000/):

> Sure sounding like *another* housing crisis is right around the corner. Funny how history has a habit of repeating itself when you have an incompetent government that only serves the wealthy.
> 
> E: It doesn't make a difference to blame one party or another. One administration or another. It's a systemic issue, and we can expect many more recessions and economic crises going forward without fundamental change. That incremental shit isn't going to work unless you want to wake up at 70 and be glad it's worse than what it was when you were 35.

## Susan B. Anthony's headstone gets plastic shield for voter stickers

> I think we can all agree that defacing a gravestone is shitty, but I think we can all also agree that recognizing Anthony for her work by visiting her grave site and symbolically giving her our voter stickers is a pretty cool thing to do. And for that, I think giving voters that want to do this some way to actually do it without damaging her headstone is the best possible solution. So good for you, Rochester!

## Man walking around Cleveland Heights with long-gun quoted as saying ‘He’s going to kill Black people’

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleveland19.com/2020/10/25/man-walking-around-cleveland-heights-with-long-gun-quoted-saying-hes-going-kill-black-people/):

> CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio - Cleveland Heights police are aware of a circulating social media post that alleges a man with a gun walked around town threatening to kill Black people. "On the afternoon of October 25, 2020, the Police Department was notified about a social media post indicating that the man had told someone that he was"going to kill black people. Please all of my friends IN THE CLEVELAND HEIGHTS AREA !!!! this man and his son is walking around with a gun and the man says "He's going to kill black people" with that gun.

> I know the area. The beard and the long black coat and yamulke suggest this guy is an Orthodox Jew. This neighborhood is known as the B streets and is shared by Orthodox and African Americans. Two factors which might suggest otherwise is Saturday is the Sabbath and the kid isn't dressed in his Saturday clothes. Of course someone who wants to go kill people has lapsed in his devotion. He's our version of a racist redneck.

## NASA telescope uncovers definitive evidence of water on the moon

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-telescope-uncovers-definitive-evidence-of-water-on-the-moon/?):

> Studying water on the moon requires a giant, flying telescope. If all the water and water ice are confined to certain areas on the moon, will that pose problems for international cooperation? The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 includes a principle that the moon and other bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and that countries cannot make a claim of sovereignty over the moon. The management of moon resources is still a hotly debated topic, and the Artemis Accords don't explicitly prohibit the commercialization of water and other material mined on the moon.

`/u/Andromeda321` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jih963/nasa_telescope_uncovers_definitive_evidence_of/):

> Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!
> 
> **Didn't we already know there was water on the moon?** Short answer: yes.  Water on the moon in the form of ice has been known for decades, but in very specific circumstances of some craters in the south pole that never get sunlight.  The trick is the daytime temperatures on the moon (remember, a day lasts two weeks there- as in, sunrise to sunset) reaches above the boiling temperature of water, so until now it was thought the water outside these regions would have evaporated long ago.
> 
> **What's new this time?** Scientists used a cool instrument called SOFIA, the world's only flying observatory, which is a telescope on a modified Boeing 747 and flies above 99% of the water vapor in the atmosphere and thus can make this measurement even though you can't from Earth's surface. (Full disclosure, one of the coolest things I've done was get to ride on SOFIA last year, as far south as Antarctica!  I wrote about it [here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/riding-along-with-a-stratospheric-telescope/) if you're interested in what it's like.) They basically demonstrated using its unique observation capabilities that water is also present in the sunny areas, not just the southern craters, so will hopefully be way easier for future astronauts to access.  SOFIA is basically capable of mapping the molecular existence of water at [Clavius crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavius_\(crater\)) (fun coincidence: where they had the lunar base in *2001: A Space Odyssey*!), and found it a lot of those sunlit places where no one was really expecting it.  It's also not literally water droplets or chunks of ice, mind, but a fairly low concentration, likely from micro-meteorites or the solar wind- they say it's the *equivalent of a 12 oz bottle over a square meter of soil*, and NASA on the press conference right now can't confirm how useful that'll be and how prevalent this is all over.
> 
> **What gives?  Is this that big a deal if we already knew there is water?** I mean, on the one hand, yes.  Water is obviously super important for future explorations and is really expensive to send up, so it'll be really useful for future lunar astronauts if it's more accessible.  Also, it is intriguing in terms of how prevalent water might be in other areas in space that are currently thought to be harsh environments incapable of having it.  On the other hand... this is my personal opinion, but NASA *does* like to sometimes get a splash in the press because they are a government agency that is currently looking at a lot of budget cuts for a lot of their science. Specifically, SOFIA [was canceled in the most recent proposed NASA budget](https://spacenews.com/nasas-sofia-airborne-observatory-faces-termination-again/), and it's not a cheap instrument. (I actually had a random astronomer I've never met chastising me for my article about how cool SOFIA was last year, which was weird, so this is a not-insignificant sentiment.) Obviously, a lot of scientists really disagree with this assessment of how important SOFIA is, as it's the best way to do infrared astronomy right now that we have, so it's good to have a press conference that will inevitably have a bit more press coverage than just a press release to highlight the cool things only SOFIA can do.
> 
> TL;DR- looks like there's more water than we expected on the moon, and hopefully that'll be useful for future astronauts!
