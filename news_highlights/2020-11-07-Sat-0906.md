## Important Update: 2020 Election

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jo065n/important_update_2020_election/):

> We've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night! FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. We've got a crazy week ahead of us, but if we all work together, we can do our part to protect the 2020 election.

> A few facts for you all:
> 
> * Voter fraud is incredibly rare. The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of .0000007%.
> 
> * There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)
> 
> * Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail.

## Georgia poll worker in hiding after false claims online

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-georgia-media-social-media-elections-aa0f256ec21de96fd5a41da703c4b443):

> Richard Barron, the Fulton County elections director, said late Friday that the poll worker seen in the video was discarding paper instructions, not a ballot, which would have been much larger than the paper seen in the video. CLAIM: A video showing the ballot count in Fulton County, Georgia, shows fraud because a poll worker processing absentee ballots crumples one up. "It's been questioned whether the poll worker featured in the video was discarding one of those ballots. The answer is no, undeniably no," Barron told reporters at a Friday evening news conference at the Fulton County elections warehouse in Atlanta.

## Steve Bannon Loses Lawyer After Suggesting Beheading of Fauci

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/nyregion/bannon-lawyer-beheading.html):

> Since August, Mr. Bannon has been fighting the criminal charges lodged against him by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the case in which Mr. Burck has been his lawyer. Mr. Burck gave no reasons for seeking to sever ties with Mr. Bannon in the two-paragraph letter he submitted on Friday to the judge, Analisa Torres of Federal District Court, who must approve a change in lawyers. Mr. Gillers said he did not know why Mr. Burck was seeking to withdraw from Mr. Bannon's case, but he added: "Bannon's public comments made Burck's job more difficult. Burck was hired to fight the prosecutors and should not also have to do battle with his own client."

> Starting to do it again? My usual grocery store never stopped: only one item from the household paper aisle (including paper towels, toilet paper, baby wipes) per visit. Same for disinfecting household cleaners: can’t buy both toilet bowl cleaner and kitchen/bathroom cleaning spray in the same visit. Been this way since March.
