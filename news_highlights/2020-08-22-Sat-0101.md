## US special forces veteran arrested for passing secrets to Russia

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53869484):

> A former US special forces captain has been arrested on charges of espionage, the US Department of Justice says. "Debbins violated his oath as a US Army officer, betrayed the special forces and endangered our country's national security by revealing classified information to Russian intelligence officers, providing details of his unit, and identifying special forces team members for Russian intelligence to try to recruit as a spy," Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. "The Russian intelligence agents allegedly encouraged him to join and pursue a career in the special forces, which he did," the DoJ said.

> Mom’s from Russia, lots of trips to Russia, married the daughter of a Russian military agent. That seems like a lot of red flags (literally) before he was on active duty.

> Why does it seem to be so difficult to vote in the US? Im from Germany. We vote on Sundays. Almost every school gets turned into a voting center. Schools are everywhere so usually its no more than a 15 minute walk. Then you search the right room for five minutes, if things are bad, wait for five minutes and vote. Want to do mail voting? Well, you get notified to vote. Then you say "I want to vote by Mail". Then you get the required documents and just vote. You get two envelopes, you put a signed document in one saying "yeah, that second one is my vote" so your vote remains anonymous. Its not like we are running an anarchist state over here.

> I hope the victims (and in the case of those murdered - their loved ones) get some peace from this. They have been waiting a long time for justice.
> 
> This was also one of the initial cases to use genealogy databases to match DNA from crime scenes, and there have been a lot of arrests and convictions since then. I bet there are a lot of killers and rapists who thought they got away with it suddenly feeling some fear. A fraction of what they put their victims through, but it's something.

> This seems like a good use of everyone’s time.
