## Male student given in-school suspension for wearing nail polish to Texas high school

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/male-student-given-school-suspension-wearing-nail-polish-texas-high-n1250110):

> An openly gay Texas teenager called out his high school after he was given in-school suspension for wearing nail polish. The student handbook says that men are prohibited from wearing makeup and nail polish. "If not corrected, the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day, until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of clothing to the school. Repeated offenses may result in more serious disciplinary action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct."

> I mean, just on the grounds of being sexist I don't get how the school can have policies like this.  This is like saying women can't wear pants.

> >“I want to stay away from businesses that are trying to comply the best they can,” Villanueva said.”They bent over backwards to modify their entire operation to conform to these current health orders, and then they have the rug yanked out from under them, that’s a disservice. I don’t want to make their lives any more miserable,” Villanueva told FOX 11’s Bill Melugin. Villanueva said so-called “super-spreader events,” which are usually gatherings of large groups, will instead be the department’s focus.

> Absolutely terrible headline. Very reasonable response from the Sheriff. It is not necessary to criminalize everything.

## Drug reverses age-related cognitive decline within days

Summary of [original article](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-drug-reverses-age-related-cognitive-decline.html):

> The cognitive deficits in TBI patients are often likened to premature aging, which led Rosi and Walter to wonder if the ISR could also underlie purely age-related cognitive decline. Animals who received small daily doses of ISRIB during the three-day training process were able to accomplish the task as well as youthful mice, much better than animals of the same age who didn't receive the drug. Small molecule cognitive enhancer reverses age-related memory decline in mice, eLife.
