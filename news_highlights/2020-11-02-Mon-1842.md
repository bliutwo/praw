## Supreme Court of Georgia rules against immunity for three former Washington County Sheriff's deputies

Summary of [original article](https://41nbc.com/2020/11/02/370103/):

> SANDERSVILLE, Georgia - The Supreme Court of Georgia has ruled against a Washington County judge's decision that granted three former county sheriff's deputies immunity from prosecution before they were set to stand trial in the 2017 tasing death of an African-American man. Washington County District Attorney, Hayward Atlman, appealed the judge's decision, asking that the murder charges against the former deputies be reinstated. "We determine that, in granting immunity, the trial court made findings of material fact.that were inconsistent with its legal conclusions regarding the deputies' encounter with Martin, conflated principles regarding the reasonable use of force by law enforcement with self-defense and immunity, made unclear findings of material fact with respect to whether any or all of the deputies used force intended or likely to cause death, and did not address the facts pertinent to each of the three deputies individually," said Justice Charles J. Bethel.

`/u/d3k3d` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jmrjk6/supreme_court_of_georgia_rules_against_immunity/):

> They tased a man nearly non stop for 4 min. They weren't doing their job, they tortured an unarmed, mentally ill person to death and a judge AGREED with them. That's insane from every angle. They should all be in prison, including the judge.

## ‘Non-scalable’ fence to be erected around White House before election

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/02/white-house-non-scaleable-fence-election):

> Federal authorities are expected to re-erect a "Non-scalable" fence around the White House on Monday, a day before a presidential election many fear may lead to mass protest, civil unrest and even armed insurrection. Amid speculation that the election result will not be immediately known and signs Republicans will either declare victory early or mount legal challenges if Donald Trump appears to have lost, multiple news outlets reported the White House plan, citing anonymous sources. Amid protests near the White House, at which federal agents confronted and assaulted mostly peaceful demonstrators, it was reported that Trump was taken to a protective bunker under the executive mansion.
