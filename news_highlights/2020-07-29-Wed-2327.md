> *A former Florida theme park security guard has been arrested for allegedly acting like a "vigilante" when he "racially profiled" and falsely detained a Black teen who was on his way to basketball practice, prosecutors said. The 18-year-old was riding his bicycle during the early morning hours of June 8 when Luis Santos drove his car alongside the teenager.*

> *"You work here? You live here?" asked Santos, 54, as he recorded with a cellphone, according to excerpts released by prosecutors. The teenager stopped and answered Santos' questions before the situation quickly escalated.*
> 
> 
> *"You're not going anywhere," said Santos, stepping out of his vehicle. "You're being detained. You're not going anywhere."*
> 
> *It took local sheriff's deputies about eight minutes to arrive after Santos' call, during which the teen, who kept his hands in the air, was terrified as Santos allegedly placed his right hand over his pants pocket in a "manner that made the victim feel as if the defendant may have a weapon, even though none was seen," according to the criminal affidavit.*

> ... Another would-be Zimmerman playing cop.

> 
> I’m picturing two tough looking gangsters suddenly seeing the bear peeking out of a stash bag and smacking the thief upside his head. “You idiot, you don’t just steal a woman’s bear! Jeezus now we godda return this!”

## No-protest condition will be dropped for people facing federal charges in Portland demonstrations

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/07/no-protest-condition-for-people-facing-federal-charges-in-portland-demonstrations-will-be-dropped.html):

> A judge-imposed condition that required about a dozen protesters arrested this month by federal officers to not participate in any public demonstrations or public assemblies while on release is expected to be dropped, prosecutors and public defenders said Wednesday. On Wednesday, Acting Homeland Secretary Chad F. Wolf said there had been 94 arrests by federal officers during nightly protests in Portland to protest police violence and racial injustice. Charges have included arson and attempted arson, assault on a federal officer, operating a drone in restricted airspace, stalking and harassing federal officers and failing to comply with a federal order.

`/u/Kn0thingIsTerrible` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i0bsqq/noprotest_condition_will_be_dropped_for_people/):

> So, it’s pretty obvious nobody actually read the article.
> 
> The conditions weren’t dropped, the terminology was modified to fall in line with standard judicial protocols. 
> 
> Essentially, the Judges involved in the case scribbled out the “no protesting” thing to speed up the release process. Subsequently, it was determined the phrasing didn’t follow proper protocol, so they changed it to follow proper protocol: those arrested can’t go back to within five blocks of the area where they committed the crime.
> 
> They can still protest all they want, they’re just not allowed to protest anywhere near the protests.

## Union head calls on retail stores to put some muscle behind mask mandates

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/retail-workers-shouldn-t-be-tasked-enforcing-store-mask-rules-n1235231):

> Stores need to hire security guards and give management the go-ahead to crack down on shoppers who refuse to wear masks, the head of a union that represents retail workers said Wednesday. "If they say they have a face mask policy and don't enforce it, then they don't have a face mask policy," said Appelbaum, who said that under their contracts, workers at Bloomingdale's and Macy's in New York aren't required to serve customers who aren't wearing masks. In what's perhaps the best-known example of store workers having to lay down the law, another Florida man was caught on video pushing and shoving Walmart workers in Orlando after he was told he couldn't enter the store without a mask.

`/u/Thedrunner2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i0dzv1/union_head_calls_on_retail_stores_to_put_some/):

> Yes the big question is who enforces the mandate when a person doesn’t want to comply but still enter the store. It won’t be feasible to have a police response to every incident and it puts store workers in a vulnerable and awkward position to try and enforce the rule. Just wear the damn mask in a store please.
