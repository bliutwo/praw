## Important Update: 2020 Election

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jo065n/important_update_2020_election/):

> We've never had an election where ballots weren't all counted on election night! FALSE. Ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. We've got a crazy week ahead of us, but if we all work together, we can do our part to protect the 2020 election.

## Mississippi Votes to End Jim Crow Electoral College-Like System; Popular Vote to Choose Governor

Summary of [original article](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/6733/mississippi-votes-to-end-jim-crow-electoral-college-like-system-popular-vote-to-choose-governor/):

> Mississippi has voted to end a Jim Crow-era constitutional provision intended to dilute the Black vote and ensure white voters would be able to choose governors and other statewide officials. It created an electoral college-like system requiring candidates for statewide office to win, not only the popular vote, but also a majority of Mississippi House districts. On Election Day, Mississippi voters had the opportunity to vote to rid the state constitution of a remnant that still remains from the one Vardaman helped design: A state-level elections law similar to the national electoral college system that requires candidates for eight statewide offices, including governor, to win not only the popular vote, but a majority of House districts.
