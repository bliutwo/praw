> Washington - The National Basketball Association has severed ties to a training center in China's western Xinjiang region, where Beijing faces growing international condemnation over its treatment of minorities.

"The financial impact of NBA games not airing on television in China has been significant," Tatum wrote.

## Feds use tear gas to try to disperse Portland protests

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/3cb6a8f41f0b291758f0f0803a0fe0d9):

> A persistent crowd of protesters remained outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, into the early hours of Saturday as fireworks were shot at the building and plumes of tear gas, dispensed by U.S. agents, lingered above. "The federal government acted in violation of those individuals' rights and probably acted in violation of the Constitution in the sense of exercising powers that are reserved to the states, but just because the federal government acts in ways that overstep its authority doesn't mean the state has an injury," he said. In the lawsuit, Oregon had asked the judge to command agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Protective Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to stop detaining protesters without probable cause, to identify themselves before arresting anyone and to explain why an arrest is taking place.

> >The flow of tear gas caused protesters to disperse at times, some becoming sick as others remaining towards the front of the courthouse with leaf blowers directing the gas back to the courthouse. **Federal agents had leaf blowers of their own to counteract.**
> 
> I think we've started an arms race, people.

Summary of [original article](https://www.northcentralpa.com/news/local/activist-burns-nazi-confederate-flag-outside-williamsport-court-house/article_3b72d3b0-cd00-11ea-bffb-ff8cbcb38123.html):

> The Trump-Russian flag was meant to represent "Trump's subservient relationship with Putin." The Trump-Confederate flag represented "Trump's embrace of the horrendous values" the confederate flag represents. "Today we're cited by burning rubbish in public, obviously the Trump flag, the Putin flag, the Nazi flag, the Confederate flag, is rubbish. So, we burnt everything in the trash can of history, right there," said Stilp following the event. Three years ago in the wake of the Charlottesville protests, Stilp orchestrated in similar flag burning protests at local county court houses and local events including the Bloomsburg Fair.

## LSD Chemist William Leonard Pickard to be Released From Prison

Summary of [original article](https://www.psymposia.com/magazine/william-leonard-pickard-lsd/):

> The decision comes after Pickard spent 20 years in prison for conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and dispense LSD. Pickard and his partner, Clyde Apperson, were arrested in 2000 while moving what was alleged to be their LSD laboratory across Kansas, and they were convicted in 2003. "The court concludes that Pickard is at greater risk than the average inmate of suffering a severe illness should he contract COVID-19, and further that he faces some risk of exposure to the virus. Unfortunately, the optimistic portrayal of BOP efforts to limit the spread of the virus, as documented in the government's Response, has been overtaken by events. Nationwide, the BOP has completed 33,684 tests, with 9,936 showing a positive result. Pickard is incarcerated at FCI Tucson, Arizona, where 11 inmates and staff members have been diagnosed with the virus. No inmates or staff have died of the virus. Social distancing within the prison is difficult." Julie Holland, M.D. is reporting that LSD-chemist and longtime drug war prisoner, William Leonard Pickard, is being released from prison.
