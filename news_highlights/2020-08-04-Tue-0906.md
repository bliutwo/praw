> > Officers were alerted to a possible stolen vehicle just before 11 a.m. Sunday, according to a statement from the department. They stopped a vehicle matching the license plate and description
> 
> Oh, really? Because the plate number that pinged [belonged to a motorcycle from out of state](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/aurora-police-detain-black-family-after-mistaking-their-vehicle-as-stolen), not an SUV from Colorado. I've seen a lot of motorcycles, none of them looked like an SUV.

## Portland police smash window, slash tires of woman’s Prius during protest dustup (video)

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/08/portland-police-smash-window-slash-tires-of-womans-prius-during-protest-dustup-video.html):

> A woman driving a Prius with "Press" written on the side had her car tires slashed and rear window shattered by Portland police as she tried to leave the scene of a heated weekend demonstration on the city's east side, according to the woman and videos of the encounter. A group of police then surround the Prius and can be heard pounding on her car with batons before it comes to a complete stop, according to two videos reviewed by The Oregonian/OregonLive. A statement released by the Portland Police Bureau on Sunday said: "A person moved a car slowly in front of police, interfering with their attempts to safely move people out of the road. To remove the hazard the car presented, Portland Police deflated its tires and passed it by."

> Wouldn’t the vehicle be *more hazardous* with broken glass everywhere?

> I don’t understand the logic here

## Wave of evictions expected as moratoriums end in many states

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/833d91877e2f0fa913c5258978a9e83c):

> The federal eviction moratorium that protects more than 12 million renters living in federally subsidized apartments or units with federally backed mortgages expired July 25. Housing advocates fear parts of the country could soon look like Milwaukee, which saw a 21% spike in eviction filings in June, to nearly 1,500 after the moratorium was lifted in May. It's more than 24% across the state. Experts credit the slower pace to the federal eviction moratorium as well as states and municipalities that used tens of millions of dollars in federal stimulus funding for rental assistance.

`/u/Mycateatsmoney` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i3guc2/wave_of_evictions_expected_as_moratoriums_end_in/):

> The evictions topic needs more precise info:
> 
> 1. The courts will be overwhelmed like the 2008 crisis so this may give time to a lot of people.
> 2. The biggest numbers of at risk are in California, New York and New Jersey. 
> 3. Aug 24 is technically the earliest it can happen.
> 4. Trump may write an executive order to delay this (Im still trying to understand how executive orders work since this guy just signs them like he tweets)
> 5. Fall is coming, covid-19, still out of control.
> 6. Minorities are the most affected by this, given the racial tensions today, no matter how you see it, we need to understand the eviction topic fully to prepare and demand action from the government.

## Don't wear a mask in Houston, receive $250 fine

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/dont-wear-a-mask-in-houston-receive-250-fine.amp?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot&__twitter_impression=true):

> HOUSTON - The City of Houston will begin issuing citations to people who are not wearing a mask. "For months, we have focused on education and not citations. But now, I am instructing the Houston Police Department to issue necessary warnings and citations to anyone not wearing a mask in public if they do not meet the criteria for an exemption," Mayor Turner said. Houston police officers will be issuing the warnings and citations to anyone not wearing a face-covering in public, as outlined in Texas Governor Greg Abbott's statewide mandatory mask order.

`/u/Ms-Mode` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i35y2s/dont_wear_a_mask_in_houston_receive_250_fine/):

> I’ll wager 250 bucks no Texan law enforcement officer is gonna cite anyone for not wearing a mask and if they do, Texan courts will likely dismiss the citation. We’ve had the same penalties in our county for over 6 weeks and nobody gets fined. The County Sheriff has already stated that his department has little interest in upholding our Governor’s executive orders.
> 
> Our County’s DA dismissed charges against a civilian woman who drove up along side a teenager with a BLM poster during a peaceful rally and flashed her taser (which failed) then pepper sprayed the minor (which didn’t fail) while spewing threats and profanity before speeding off through a red light.
> 
> Penalties without teeth are pointless.

> They were only missing since Thursday. People knew they didn't show up and they were found pretty darn quick. Good proof that you always want to tell people where you're going on long trips or trips into the wilderness. That's the difference from being found in a few days usually or weeks/months/likely death.
