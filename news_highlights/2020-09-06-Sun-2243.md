> Amazon is reportedly barring the sale of foreign plants to the US, following reports that people across the country this summer have been receiving suspicious, unsolicited packages of seeds, many of which are postmarked from China. The email Amazon reportedly sent to foreign seed sellers said the change is part of the company's "Ongoing efforts to protect our customers and enhance the customer experience," the Journal said. "USDA is currently collecting seed packages from recipients and will test their contents and determine if they contain anything that could be of concern to US agriculture or the environment," a press statement reads, warning: "Do not plant seeds from unknown origins."

> We really need to have some sort of mental health outreach team for situations like this. I don’t know the solution but it seems as though too many people are having mental health crises and being met with police instead of mental health professionals.

## First Clone of Endangered Przewalski’s Horse Born in Conservation Effort to Save the Species

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5886467/clone-endangered-przewalskis-horse-zoo/):

> The first successfully cloned endangered Przewalski's horse was born on Aug. 6 in a veterinary facility in Texas, San Diego Zoo Global announced on Friday. Przewalski's horses were once extinct in the wild, and while intensive breeding programs helped revive the species and reintroduce them into the grasslands of China and Mongolia, nearly all can be traced back to 12 Przewalski's horses that were born in the wild, the San Diego Zoo said in its press release. San Diego Zoo Global partnered with Revive & Restore-a wildlife conservation group that aims to incorporate biotechnology into conservation efforts-and ViaGen Equine-a company that clones horses and pets-to successfully clone the Przewalski's horse.

> Really cool stuff here. The clone will be introduced to a captive herd to help strengthen the genetic breeding pool. The species is effectively extinct, so now these scientists are hoping to establish a healthy captive breeding population to save the species.
