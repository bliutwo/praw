> This  is another tragedy that sadly, looks highly suspicious. The victim was armed (lawful concealed carry  permit), but had just returned from Subway with a sandwich, he was not a  suspect in any criminal investigation and had no criminal record,  raising questions about why he was confronted in the first place. He was  shot and killed while entering his own home and found by his 5-year-old  brother and grandmother.
> 
> Naturally,  there is no body-cam footage or eyewitnesses, meaning the deputy can  tell whatever story he wants to avoid prosecution.

## Rats besiege New York Chipotle, eating avocados and attacking staff

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/chipotle-rats-new-york-avocado):

> At first glance, it might sound like small potatoes compared to when the CDC had to warn against New York's cannibal rats during the pandemic. "It's pure chaos every time a rat appears," employee Melvin Paulino told the New York Post - speaking of the brazen behavior of the rats. The rats seem to have developed the same expensive taste for avocados as many New Yorkers - they liked them so much Chipotle eventually had to move the fruit to the freezer to keep the rats at bay.
