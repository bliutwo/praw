> What this is not reporting is the difficulty in knowing exactly *what* is in the tanks. The tanks were built in the 40s and 50s, for the most part. Waste was dumped in them until they were full or deemed to dangerous, then they just sealed them up and opened a new tank. They did not track what was dumped where so they have zero idea what is really in them beyond the fact that they are highly radioactive and every tank is different. Trying to clean up what is basically a gigantic chemical spill when you do not know what was spilled is highly problematic. You cannot just use treatment X, because what will work for one thing, might make the other thing worse.  A lot of work is going into to trying to determine what exact,y they are dealing with so they can know what treatment will work.

> It’s never a popular opinion here but as a parent this is terrifying and all too real. When you have an infant your head is constantly cloudy from lack of sleep, and there is a very real phenomenon of forgetting things when you break from routine. It’s easy to point fingers but it can happen to anyone.
