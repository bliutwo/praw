> These politicians are part of the problem,  and I'm tired of people giving some of them a pass just for having a D next to their name.  
> Here in LA,  we had the infamous incident of our governor being caught dining maskless indoors after weeks of scolding tweets ordering us peasants to follow the rules.  Next,  a city supervisor declared outdoor dining so dangerous that it justified laying off thousands of workers without pay or aid.... and then went to celebrate her vote with dinner out.  
> 
> We already have a problem with people not taking these measures seriously. How the fuck do they expect people to make the huge sacrifices they're asking of us,  when they are themselves unwilling?
> 
> They want us to sacrifice our livelihoods, our children's education, our future,  our wellbeing, and even our HOMES. They can't be bothered to sacrifice their 300 dollar truffle pasta.  Fuck these boners. Vote them ALL out.

## Divers discover Nazi WW2 enigma machine in Baltic Sea

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-war-enigma-idUSKBN28D25F):

> 2 Min Read.BERLIN - German divers searching the Baltic Sea for discarded fishing nets have stumbled upon a rare Enigma cipher machine used by the Nazi military during World War Two which they believe was thrown overboard from a scuttled submarine. "I've made many exciting and strange discoveries in the past 20 years. But I never dreamt that we would one day find one of the legendary Enigma machines," said Huber. The Nazi military used the machines to send and receive secret messages during World War Two but British cryptographers cracked the code, helping the Allies gain an advantage in the naval struggle to control the Atlantic.

## ‘Nobody Sees Us’: Testing-Lab Workers Strain Under Demand

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/health/coronavirus-testing-labs-workers.html?referringSource=articleShare):

> Caseloads have skyrocketed; America's testing capacity has increased since March, but it has been vastly overtaken by the demand for tests. Antibody test/serology test: A test that detects antibodies specific to the coronavirus. Antigen tests are fast, taking as little as five minutes, but are less accurate than tests that detect genetic material from the virus.

`/u/GrumpyOik` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k62uob/nobody_sees_us_testinglab_workers_strain_under/):

> I work in labs - I'm not going to pretend it's not been difficult over the last 8 months. Our workload doubled, redoubled, redoubled again. We went from 100 samples a day (for Covid) to about 2000 with only a very small increase in staffing.
> 
> That said, none of us are unaware of the picture outside. We have jobs, we have income. It might feel shitty working all hours - but it's better than losing your home.
