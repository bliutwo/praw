## Don't wear a mask in Houston, receive $250 fine

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/dont-wear-a-mask-in-houston-receive-250-fine.amp?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot&__twitter_impression=true):

> HOUSTON - The City of Houston will begin issuing citations to people who are not wearing a mask. "For months, we have focused on education and not citations. But now, I am instructing the Houston Police Department to issue necessary warnings and citations to anyone not wearing a mask in public if they do not meet the criteria for an exemption," Mayor Turner said. Houston police officers will be issuing the warnings and citations to anyone not wearing a face-covering in public, as outlined in Texas Governor Greg Abbott's statewide mandatory mask order.

> I’ll wager 250 bucks no Texan law enforcement officer is gonna cite anyone for not wearing a mask and if they do, Texan courts will likely dismiss the citation. We’ve had the same penalties in our county for over 6 weeks and nobody gets fined. The County Sheriff has already stated that his department has little interest in upholding our Governor’s executive orders.
> 
> Our County’s DA dismissed charges against a civilian woman who drove up along side a teenager with a BLM poster during a peaceful rally and flashed her taser (which failed) then pepper sprayed the minor (which didn’t fail) while spewing threats and profanity before speeding off through a red light.
> 
> Penalties without teeth are pointless.

Summary of [original article](https://www.startribune.com/daily-mail-leaks-bodycam-footage-of-george-floyd-arrest-killing/571995372/):

> A British media company on Monday published segments of two leaked body-worn camera videos showing the arrest and death of George Floyd in May at the hands of Minneapolis police. The videos published by the Daily Mail appeared to have been recorded on a device while they were played on a laptop in a courthouse conference room. The bodycam videos and a video recorded by a bystander showed that Floyd repeatedly told the officers he couldn't breathe, and that several bystanders pleaded with them to stop, but were ignored.

## Facebook refuses to remove doctored Nancy Pelosi video

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/03/facebook-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-false-label):

> Factcheckers monitoring content on Facebook have put a "Partly false" label on the latest video that it said was manipulated to make it appear as if the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was drunk or drugged, but by Monday the social media giant had refused to remove the video from its platform. "The original video revealed [Pelosi] was speaking and acting normally," Lead Stories wrote in its assessment of the manipulated video. "Following an incident over a year ago with a previous video of Speaker Pelosi, we took a number of key steps, making it very clear to people on Facebook when a third-party factchecker determines content to be false and updating our policy to make explicit the kind of manipulated media we will remove," the spokesperson said.
