> Their own fucking leadership is saying there will be unprecedented high volume come November. There is no way to interpret this except as an attack on our democracy.
> 
> Edit: You can shove your 2nd amendment up your ass. Americans don't kill each other over politics. At the very least let's at least try mass protest first. Jesus fucking christ.

> I read an article that explains this mathematically. In order to get to herd immunity you need at least 60% of the population to get it. The US has a population of around 390 million that means there would have to be 1.9 million cases every week for 3 years, you would need 190,000 new cases everyday for 3 years to get to the magic 60% number. If this were allowed to happen the sheer number of cases would overrun our healthcare system and drastically raise the mortality rate. People would be unable to get the medical help for covid and for non covid issues. It would be an unmitigated disaster to say the least. Anyone who preaches herd immunity by any other means besides an effective vaccine is an idiot. Math doesn’t lie.

## U.S. Postal Service warns of 'significant risk' of late ballots

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-post-office-idUSKCN25A291):

> The Postal Service has warned some states that allowing voters to request ballots less than a week before the election does not leave enough time to print up the ballot, mail it to the voter and have it returned. "There is significant risk that the voter will not have sufficient time to complete and mail the completed ballot back to election officials in time for it to arrive by the state's return deadline," Postal Service General Counsel Thomas Marshall wrote in a July 29 letter to Michigan's top election official. The Postal Service recommends that mail ballots should be completed and in the mail back to election offices by that point, according to Marshall's letter.

> Deliver your ballot in person. Don't mail it back. However you vote, do everything as early as possible. Register as early as possible, pick up your ballot as early as possible, and return your ballot as early as possible.

## New Jersey to mail ballots to everyone in November election

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-elections-new/new-jersey-to-mail-ballots-to-everyone-in-november-election-idUSKCN25A1VW?il=0):

> WASHINGTON - New Jersey will mail a ballot to every voter in the state for November's elections, as well as hold in-person voting amid the coronavirus pandemic, the state's Democratic governor said on Friday. New Jersey will use methods similar to what it employed for its primary vote in July, Murphy told CNN in an interview, with improvements based on lessons learned then. Election officials in most states have encouraged at-home voting as the highly contagious nature of the novel coronavirus has made voting in person a concern.

`/u/Ozwaldo` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/i9xeg7/new_jersey_to_mail_ballots_to_everyone_in/):

> And elderly Republican voters will continue to post on Facebook about how this means there's going to be voter fraud.  (But obviously only if a Democrat wins).
> 
> It's a fucking pandemic, and these cowards are acting like voting by mail *isn't* a good idea right now.  Mostly because they know that the Republican party is dying and can't win elections honestly any more.

## Portland postal workers fight top-down changes at USPS

Summary of [original article](https://www.streetroots.org/news/2020/08/13/portland-postal-workers-are-fighting-spate-new-initiatives):

> Jamie Partridge, a retired letter carrier who is an organizer for Communities and Postal Workers United, said election-related mail was still being delivered the day after Tuesday's Portland City Council special election. On Aug. 5, about 75 postal workers and their allies rallied in front of the Rose City Park post office in Northeast Portland to show support for the Postal Service, defend voting by mail and decry initiatives they say have forced them to leave mail unsorted on carts. Partridge, of Communities and Postal Workers United, said the ascent of DeJoy - who spent most of his career working for a private logistics and transportation company - is part of a longer push to privatize the Postal Service, which has operated independently of the U.S. government, but with government oversight, since 1970.

## 'She literally begged for an ambulance': Midwives charged after mother dies during home birth

> Caroline Lovell died in Melbourne's Austin Hospital after complications from the birth, which took place in the lounge room of her Watsonia home. A 2016 inquiry recommended the case be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, after coroner Peter White ruled the midwives' management of Ms Lovell's home birth was "Inadequate". The coroner said Ms Lovell's vital signs were not adequately monitored and that an ambulance was not called promptly when she fainted after the birth.
