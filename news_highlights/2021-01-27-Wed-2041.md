Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of D.C. after Trump's loss.

## US puts hold on foreign arms sales, including F-35s to UAE

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-politics-united-arab-emirates-b35347c143dcd5a5980b4b886363c293):

> WASHINGTON - The Biden administration has put a temporary hold on several major foreign arms sales initiated by former President Donald Trump. ADVERTISEMENT."The department is temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending U.S. defense transfers and sales under Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales to allow incoming leadership an opportunity to review," the department said. In its waning months, the Trump administration authorized tens of billions of dollars in new arms sales, including announcing plans to send 50 F-35s to the UAE. That announcement came shortly after Trump lost the Nov. 6 election to now-President Joe Biden and followed the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE, under which the Arab states agreed to normalize relations with Israel.

> That whole administration always came across as the people who will just say anything to get their way. Even if it didn’t make sense.

"The January 6th assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: the rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat. The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve," Psaki said.

## NJ hospital gave vaccine to wealthy donors, ineligible relatives in December

Summary of [original article](https://nj1015.com/hunterdon-medica-center-covid-19-vaccine/):

> The line-cutting at the hospital was revealed by vaccine registry information that a whistleblower provided to New Jersey 101.5, demonstrating that despite the state's plan for an "Equitable" distribution of the vaccine, those with privilege are managing to get it anyway. After the state this month opened eligibility to all adults with underlying medical conditions and a host of essential workers, people seeking the vaccine have encountered fully booked vaccine sites. "While the timeline for an individual to receive that vaccine may be complicated, the Foundation is here to help you. This does not mean you will receive the vaccine prior to the category under which you fall but rather, that we will assist you in navigating a process that is rapidly changing and can sometimes be complex."

`/u/bodielisi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l6gi5w/nj_hospital_gave_vaccine_to_wealthy_donors/):

> I imagine that as more information is uncovered as to the whereabouts of the early shipments of vaccines, that more stories like this will be coming to light. I can only wonder how many ineligible people associated with the outgoing administration received it as well.
