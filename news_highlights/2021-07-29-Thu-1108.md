> Texas' deputy attorney general apologized Wednesday after receiving backlash for tweeting that Simone Biles was a "National embarrassment" when she withdrew from the team gymnastics final. Aaron Reitz on Tuesday tweeted a video of gymnast Kerri Strug, who competed with an injured ankle to help Team USA win gold in 1996, writing, "Contrast this with our selfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles." "In a moment of frustration and disappointment, I opined on subjects for which I am not adequately versed. That was an error. I can't imagine what Simone Biles has gone through."
