> For everyone who doesn't know how to read articles or hasn't actually researched anything about this case, this decision does not mean that her conservatorship can't end.
> 
> This was an informal proceeding. There was no trial. This was a courtesy granted by the judge so that Britney could speak on the record on her own behalf. There was no way this judge was going to end the conservatorship without an actual trial/investigation.
> 
> He instructed her attorney to file a formal petition to end the conservatorship.

> 
> Remember? When it was cold in the winter months, and you know you don't have the right kind of clothes on. You probably dressed yourself like I did. Sitting in the cafeteria, smelling the food, feeling that hunger in your stomach, but those potato triangles and that milk was coming soon.

> We didn't have milk at the house, it was "too expensive." But twice a day there were two little cartons of heaven waiting in a milk crate, on a shiny metal counter, just for me and you. 
> 
> I thank God the current and future generations of kids in California get to have their milk and their potato wedges.

## Bill Cosbyâ€™s sex assault conviction overturned by court

`/u/throwawaynumber53` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ob16pz/bill_cosbys_sex_assault_conviction_overturned_by/):

> Lawyer here. I've skimmed the decision, and here's what happened.
> 
> The main reason this case was overturned was because in 2005 the Montgomery County District Attorney effectively promised never to prosecute Cosby for raping Andrea Costand (through a public press release saying he was not going to prosecute Cosby), believing that there was no way he could get a conviction, and seeking to give her some justice by helping her when she sued him for the assault in civil court.
> 
> Because the DA had said they were not going to prosecute him, Cosby was unable to "plead the 5th" in the civil lawsuit and was forced to admit under oath at depositions to giving multiple women Quaaludes before he sexually assaulted them, and even said he gave Costand multiple Benadryl before he assaulted her.
> 
> Years later, a new Montgomery County DA said that the DA in 2005 hadn't formally bound the state, and therefore she could go forward with prosecuting him. At the trial, Cosby's lawyers argued that he couldn't be prosecuted because of what the DA did in 2005, but the judge said that earlier decision was not enforceable and allowed Cosby to be prosecuted, in part because there was no *signed* non-prosecute agreement, only the public statement.
> 
> Today the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed ([link to decision is here](https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-100-2020mo%20-%20104821740139246918.pdf?cb=1)), saying that:
> 
> >For the reasons detailed below, we hold that, when a prosecutor makes an unconditional promise of non-prosecution, and when the defendant relies upon that guarantee to the detriment of his constitutional right not to testify, the principle of fundamental fairness that undergirds due process of law in our criminal justice system demands that the promise be enforced.
> 
> In other words, the DA in 2005 promised not to prosecute Cosby for raping Costand (in an effort to allow her to sue him civilly), that must be enforced, and therefore Cosby goes free.
> 
> There are other aspects to the decision, but that's the big one.

## Robinhood to pay $70 million for misleading customers and outages, the largest FINRA penalty ever

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-for-misleading-customers-and-outages-the-largest-finra-penalty-ever.html):

> The settlement regards the technical failures Robinhood experienced in March of 2020, Robinhood's lack of due diligence before approving customers to place options trades and purveying misleading information to customers about aspects like trading on margin. "Robinhood has invested heavily in improving platform stability, enhancing our educational resources, and building out our customer support and legal and compliance teams," Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, head of public policy communications for Robinhood said in response to the fine. "The fine imposed in this matter, the highest ever levied by FINRA, reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood's violations, including FINRA's finding that Robinhood communicated false and misleading information to millions of its customers," said Jessica Hopper, executive vice president and head of FINRA's Department of Enforcement.

> Cost of "doing business" indeed.
