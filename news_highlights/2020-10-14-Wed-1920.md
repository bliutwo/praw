The clash between Mr. Cooper and Ms. Cooper began as he biked to search for birds in a semi-wild section of the park known as the Ramble, where dogs must be leashed.

## Covid-19 herd immunity, backed by White House, is a 'dangerous fallacy,' scientists warn

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-19-herd-immunity-backed-white-house-dangerous-fallacy-scientists-n1243415):

> Herd immunity, which occurs when enough people become immune to a contagious disease to make further spread unlikely, is a "Dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence," the scientists wrote. "There is no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection," they wrote, adding that "The consequence of waning immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the indefinite future." SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.Senior White House officials briefed reporters two days ago on a call in which one official highlighted an online movement called the "Great Barrington Declaration," which favors herd immunity. "The arrival of a second wave and the realization of the challenges ahead has led to renewed interest in a so-called herd immunity approach, which suggests allowing a large uncontrolled outbreak in the low-risk population while protecting the vulnerable," the authors of the letters wrote in The Lancet.
