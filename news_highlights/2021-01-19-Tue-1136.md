A U.S. Army official and a senior U.S. intelligence official say the two National Guard members have been found to have ties to fringe right group militias. U.S. defense officials, worried about a potential insider attack or other threat from service members involved in securing the event, pushed the FBI to vet all of the 25,000 National Guard troops coming into the area.

## Supermarket chain Aldi to pay U.S. workers who get COVID-19 vaccination

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-aldi/supermarket-chain-aldi-to-pay-u-s-workers-who-get-covid-19-vaccination-idUSKBN29O1GN):

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - German supermarket chain Aldi on Tuesday became the latest firm in the grocery sector to offer incentives for U.S. employees getting a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it would give up to four hours of pay to those who choose to receive inoculations. Dollar General Corp last week offered frontline employees a similar incentive after they get the vaccine, while grocery delivery company Instacart said it would pay $25 to more than half-a-million gig workers if they chose to take time off to get vaccinated. Aldi said it was working with officials across the United States to get workers priority access to the vaccine, joining other companies including Amazon.com Inc and Uber Technologies Inc lobbying to move workers closer to the front of the line for vaccinations.

`/u/Whornz4` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l0lw5s/supermarket_chain_aldi_to_pay_us_workers_who_get/):

> All supermarkets should follow this and pay for their employees to get the vaccines. In the long term it will likely save them money by having fewer sick employees. It's also another benefit to tout to your staff.

> Italian police present the recovered painting, which is believed to date back to the 1510s. The portrait's owner, the Museum of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, said on its website that there are "Several hypotheses" about the painter's identity, with the "Most convincing" theory crediting Leonardo's student Girolamo Alibrandi. Police did not specify when the painting had been stolen, though the Naples museum reported being in possession of the work as recently as January 2020, when it was returned from Rome.
