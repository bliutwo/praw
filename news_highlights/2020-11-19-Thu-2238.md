## Kyle Rittenhouse says he used coronavirus stimulus check to buy AR-15 used in fatal shooting

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kyle-rittenhouse-says-he-used-coronavirus-stimulus-check-buy-ar-n1248290):

> Kyle Rittenhouse cashed a coronavirus stimulus check to purchase the semi-automatic rife he'd later use to fatally shoot two men in Kenosha, the accused double-murderer said. In a telephone interview with the Washington Post, posted on Thursday, the jailed Rittenhouse also said he acted in self-defense and has no regrets for arming himself that fateful August night as protesters marched in the wake of Jacob Blake's shooting by police. The 17-year-old, who had worked as a YMCA lifeguard, was arrested at his home in Antioch, Illinois, a day after the Aug. 25 fatal shootings of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26."I got my $1,200 from he coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA and I got my first unemployment check, so I was like, 'Oh, I'll use this to buy it,'" Rittenhouse said in his first jailhouse interview.

> “We hired 10 contact tracers to track the spread, starting in August, but the real problem we keep running into is community cooperation. We call everyone that’s had a positive test and say, ‘Hey, this is your local health department. We’re trying to interrupt disease transmission, and we’d love your help.’ It’s nothing new,” Amber Elliott, health director in St. Francois County, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. 
> 
> “We  do the same thing for measles, mumps, and tick-borne diseases, and I’d say 99 percent of the time before COVID, people were receptive. They wanted to stop an outbreak, but now it’s all politicized.”
> 
> Elliott added, “Every time you get on the phone, you’re hoping you don’t get cussed at. Probably half of the people we call are skeptical or combative. They refuse to talk. They deny their own positive test results. They hang up. They say they’re going to hire a lawyer. They give you fake people they’ve spent time with and fake numbers. They lie and tell you they’re quarantining alone at home, but then in the background you can hear the beeping of a scanner at Walmart.”

> Elliott observed, “I’ve stayed up a lot of nights trying to understand where this whole disconnect comes from. I love living in this county. I know in my heart these are good people, but it’s like we’re living on different planets. 
> 
> I have people in my own family who believe COVID is a conspiracy and our doctors are getting paid off. I’ve done press conferences and dozens of Facebook Live videos to talk about the real science. 
> 
> Even with all the other failures happening, that’s the one thing we should be celebrating: better treatments, nurses and doctors on the front lines, promising news about vaccines. But the more I talk about the facts, the more it seems to put a target on my back.”
> 
> The statistics are “scary bad,” Elliott shared. “I go off of facts and evidence-based science, and right now, all the data in Missouri is scary bad. We only have about 70,000 people in St. Francois County, but we’ve had more than 900 new cases in the last few weeks. Our positivity rate is 25 percent and rising. The hospital is already at capacity.”

Dennard worked for Sittenfeld during his first term on City Council and during his Senate race, but DeVillers said he doesn't believe any of the councilmembers were working together.

The travel recommendation is a "Strong recommendation," not a requirement, CDC official Henry Walke said on a call with reporters Thursday. Thanksgiving and Christmas are typically the busiest times of year for domestic travel as Americans gather with friends and family around the country.

The latest accusations include the charged threat that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was to be kidnapped and possibly killed; now government court records cite subplots to stage an armed takeover of the state capitol in Lansing and televise the executions of politicians.
