## For flight attendants, getting people to wear masks is now one of the hardest parts of the job

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/flight-attendants-unruly-passengers-masks-trnd/index.html):

> In a separate case that same month, a passenger on a SkyWest Airlines flight from Atlanta to Chicago took off their mask, pestered other passengers and sexually harassed a flight attendant, the FAA alleged. All major US carriers already have mask policies in place, while several have instituted "No-fly lists" banning certain passengers who refuse to wear masks from flying with them during the pandemic. "The lack of federal guidelines or mandates has made jobs harder, and it has been made harder by inconsistent mask mandates across the United States," Taylor Garland, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, told CNN. Garland added that a common retort that flight attendants would hear from passengers unwilling to wear masks is that, "It's not the law." A federal requirement, she said, would "Eliminate that talking point for them."

> mate of mine was over his friends house one night drinking. He passed out on the couch for hours and got awoken by his friend saying he should go home. Walked him out the door saying what a good friend he has been etc - mate thought it was wierd but they where both drunk so he continued on his merry way home. 
> 
> Next day the police rock up and take him in for questioning. Apparently while he was asleep his friend had an argument with his mum, pushed her and she fell back and broke her neck. He walked my friend out saying his goodbyes and then killed himself. My friend was interrogated for like 8hours about his part in the murder suicide - of which he had no idea what had happened until they told him. It really fucked him up for a while

## 33 missing children rescued in Los Angeles trafficking operation

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/33-missing-children-rescued-los-angeles-trafficking-operation-n1255435?fbclid=IwAR0Xyu9r8liCLMcnlT6kkFJbzvCyfrLfEu2fjGYrxI0PN5NaiKZ4SiHrfjU):

> Two of the victims had been recovered multiple times while at a location known for commercial sex trafficking. Federal investigators worked with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and two dozen other law enforcement agencies. "Human trafficking is a pervasive and insidious crime that threatens the safety of our young people, who are the future of our communities," said Michel Moore, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.

`/u/Forgotten-Irrelevant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l3sa06/33_missing_children_rescued_in_los_angeles/):

> Sense they mention a lot of the victims "willingly" going back I assume these are probably older children. If I had to guess I'd say this is probably a prostitution organization that preys on teenage girls who have no other prospects in life.

## Bomb Explodes at California Church Known for Hateful Views

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/us/first-works-baptist-church-explosion.html):

> The police responded to reports of an explosion at the church, First Works Baptist Church, in El Monte, Calif., just after 1 a.m. on Saturday. The church had been the target of protests, and more than 14,000 people have signed an online petition calling on El Monte's mayor to recognize the church as a hate group and "Take them out of our city." The church is part of the New Independent Fundamental Baptist Movement, a network of 22 American and eight international churches known for their hateful rhetoric and calls for the government to round up and execute gay people, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that analyzes hate groups, reported in 2019.Mr. Mejia is an outspoken acolyte of the network's leader, Steven Anderson, an Arizona pastor who has drawn widespread condemnation for celebrating the 2016 shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., where 49 people were killed, the Southern Poverty Law Center said.

`/u/Yoerin` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l3msdi/bomb_explodes_at_california_church_known_for/):

> If a bomb explodes at a church that avocates for the "goverment to kill the gays", I can highly suspect that it wasn't a bomb planted there but a bomb (attempted to) being made there. 
> 
> Unless it was a glitter bomb. In that case it was most definitly from the gay community.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/larry-king-dead-391f55fabb843d14a2635a9bd55880d4):

> King had never met Marlon Brando, who was even tougher to get and tougher to interview, when the acting giant asked to appear on King's show in 1994. Originating from Washington on the Mutual network, "The Larry King Show" was eventually heard on more than 300 stations and made King a national phenomenon. In 2020, King lost his two oldest children, Andy King and Chaia King, who died of unrelated health problems within weeks of each other.
