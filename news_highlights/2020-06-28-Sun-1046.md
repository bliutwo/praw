## Thousands gather in Denver to protest Elijah McClain's death

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/thousands-gather-denver-protest-elijah-mcclains-death-71495180):

> 3 min read. DENVER - Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside a suburban Denver police building Saturday to call for justice in the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold by police last year. McClain's death last August has prompted a handful of small protests over the last 10 months, but his case has garnered renewed attention amid a global outcry sparked when George Floyd died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer May 25. "The Aurora Police Department has responded by circulating rumors of a 'violent threat' in order to intimidate organizers and attendees and to justify mobilizing a militarized police response to crack down on protesters," the Party for Socialism and Liberation said in a statement posted to Facebook.
