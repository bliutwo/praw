> I’m glad someone stepped up to the plate and helped recover the puppy.
> 
> My cat escaped from a cat sitter right before I returned from vacation. My family walked the neighborhood for weeks calling for him, putting up flyers, food, all the recommended techniques to no avail. 
> 
> He was picked up six weeks later and we got him back. He was just a couple of blocks from where he escaped and we’d walked that area innumerable times in the interim.
> 
> I bought a dog whistle and trained him to come to it. I can see him literally 100 yards away (binoculars) and when I blow that whistle he comes running back immediately. I’d recommend every cat owner train their cat to come to a whistle.

## Black Lives Matter flag becomes issue in Florida community

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/black-lives-matter-flag-issue-florida-community-74403879):

> In a one-page letter dated Oct. 20, the homeowners association ordered Mickle to take down his flag within 24 hours. "In order to comply with the Association's governing documents, the Board of Directors requests that you take the following action: Remove the 'Black Lives Matter' flag." "He's rightly concerned that it could happen in the future. The Blue Lives Matter flags hung for months at a time and they still remain. Those flags aren't considered noxious by the officers of the association. They need to apply their rules equally."

`/u/whatthehellsteve` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k1fa0x/black_lives_matter_flag_becomes_issue_in_florida/):

> To preface this, Blue lives matter flags were flying for months in this neighborhood.  
> 
> Now a quote from the article:
> 
> "The fact that it was a Black Lives Matter flag made no difference,” she said, adding that the flag violated association rules that require that flags be flown on a flagpole and that those flags commemorate holidays, sports teams or be seasonal in nature. The association said it does not prohibit political signs, as long as they be removed in a timely manner.
> 
> Hughes said it was unfortunate that Mickle “took offense” to the association’s notice, which she called a routine letter when rules violations occur. She would not say if similar notices were sent to homeowners flying “Blue Lives Matter” flags."

> 2 Min Read.(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Wednesday it would lay off about 32,000 workers, primarily at its theme parks, an increase from the 28,000 it announced in September, as the company struggles with limited customers due to the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for Disney confirmed that the latest figures include the 28,000 layoffs announced earlier. Earlier this month, Disney said it was furloughing additional workers from its theme park in Southern California due to uncertainty over when the state would allow parks to reopen.
