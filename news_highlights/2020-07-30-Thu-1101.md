## Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53597975):

> Donald Trump has called for November's presidential election to be postponed, saying increased postal voting could lead to fraud and inaccurate results. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said "Universal mail-in voting" would make November's vote the "Most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history" and a "Great embarrassment to the USA". Trump appears to be doing everything in his power to undermine the credibility of November's vote, in which a record number of Americans are predicted to rely on mail-in voting to avoid the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.

> No US election has ever been delayed. Whether you support DJT or not you should not be supporting this idea. It's dangerous to American democracy plain and simple.

## McDonald's CEO says restaurants "might bring in law enforcement" if customers refuse to comply with mask policy

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-mask-policy-ceo/):

> While Walmart and CVS have said they will be limiting their enforcement of the mask mandate, Kempczinski did not rule out the possibility of getting authorities involved if a situation in which a customer refuses to wear a mask escalates. "If someone is unwilling to wear a mask and comply with our rules, that might be where we might bring in law enforcement," he said. Kempczinski said restaurants and crews have undergone training about how to "Explain to customers why we have the requirement," and the training included "Deescalation." In recent months, retail workers at various stores across the country have been attacked for trying to enforce mask mandates.
