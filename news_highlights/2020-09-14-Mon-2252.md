## Ice detainees faced medical neglect and hysterectomies, whistleblower alleges

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/14/ice-detainees-hysterectomies-medical-neglect-irwin-georgia):

> Immigrants in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Georgia are being subjected to horrific conditions and treatment, including "Jarring medical neglect" and a high rate of hysterectomies among women, according to a whistleblower complaint filed by several legal advocacy groups on behalf of a nurse who works there. According to the new complaint, Wooten reported an alarmingly high rate of hysterectomies - a surgery in which part or all of the uterus is removed - being performed on Spanish-speaking immigrants, many of whom did not appear to understand why they had undergone the procedure. Project South, one of the human rights groups that filed the complaint, had previously filed a report in 2017 regarding Irwin's poor treatment of detainees, including unsanitary conditions, inedible food and refusing medical care to detainees.
