## Prosecutor in Trump criminal probe convenes grand jury

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutor-trump-criminal-probe-convenes-grand-jury-washington-post-2021-05-25/):

> Manhattan's district attorney has convened a grand jury that is expected to decide whether to indict Donald Trump, which indicates he feels he has evidence of a crime by the former president or someone close to him or by his company, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. Vance's office has said in court filings it was investigating "Possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct" at the Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records. The New York attorney general's office said a week ago that it had opened a criminal investigation into Trump's company, increasing the legal risk for Trump and his family.

> > "The panel was convened recently and will sit three days a week for six months," the Post said. "It is likely to hear several matters — not just the Trump case ­— during the duration of its term, which is longer than a traditional New York state grand-jury assignment, these people said."

> Pretty much the meat of the article.

## Soldier who called on troops to refuse vaccine distribution faces mutiny related charge

Summary of [original article](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/soldier-who-called-on-troops-to-refuse-vaccine-distribution-faces-mutiny-related-charge):

> A soldier who called on his fellow military personnel to refuse helping with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been charged with an offence related to mutiny. Kenderesi, who had a civilian hunting knife strapped to his Canadian Forces uniform and was carrying a non-Canadian helmet, questioned the safety of the vaccine. Ottawa lawyer Michel Drapeau said the laying of a charge related to mutiny is unheard of in the Canadian Forces in modern times.

## Influencers say Russia-linked PR agency asked them to disparage Pfizer vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/25/influencers-say-russia-linked-pr-agency-asked-them-to-disparage-pfizer-vaccine):

> French and German YouTubers, bloggers and influencers have been offered money by a supposedly UK-based PR agency with apparent Russian connections to falsely tell their followers the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is responsible for hundreds of deaths. The agency contacted several French health and science YouTubers last week and asked them, in poor English, to "Explain the death rate among the vaccinated with Pfizer is almost 3x higher than the vaccinated by AstraZeneca". The influencers were asked to tell their subscribers that "The mainstream media ignores this theme", and to ask: "Why some governments actively purchasing Pfizer vaccine, which is dangerous to the health of the people?".

## DC attorney general sues Amazon on antitrust grounds, alleges it illegally raises prices

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/dc-attorney-general-sues-amazon-on-antitrust-grounds-alleges-it-illegally-raises-prices.html):

> The lawsuit, filed in D.C. Superior Court, alleges Amazon illegally maintained monopoly power by using contract provisions to prevent third-party sellers on its platform from offering their products for lower prices on other platforms. Until 2019, Amazon included a clause in that document, referred to as a "Price parity provision," which prohibited sellers from offering their products on a competitors' online marketplace at a lower price than what their products sold for on Amazon. According to the complaint, even after Amazon removed the pricing parity provision from its agreement with third-party sellers, it added a nearly identical clause, referred to as its "Fair pricing policy." The fair pricing policy enables Amazon to "Impose sanctions" on a seller that offers their product for a lower price on a competing online marketplace.

> Like when you subscribe to a Subscribe and Save item to save 5% and the price goes up 30% a week later and they don't even notify you they just automatically charge the new price.
