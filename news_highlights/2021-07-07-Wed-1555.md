> The class action lawsuit also targets the three companies' CEOs.Mr Trump was suspended from his social accounts in January over public safety concerns in the wake of the Capitol riots, led by his supporters. In a news conference from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump railed against social media companies and Democrats, who he accused of espousing misinformation. At the same time on Wednesday, Mr Trump's Republican allies in Congress released a memo describing their plan "To take on Big Tech".The agenda calls for antitrust measures to "Break up" the companies, and a revamping of a law known as Section 230.Section 230, which Mr Trump tried to repeal as president, essentially stops companies like Facebook and Twitter from being liable for the things that users post.

Summary of [original article](https://www.boston25news.com/news/charlotte-flight-bahamas-canceled-when-boston-area-high-schoolers-refuse-wear-masks/V3XYJ2WJZFGGLOQZSDHKXCUUJI/):

> CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Dozens of passengers experienced a nightmare at Charlotte Douglas International Airport on Monday, telling Glenn Counts, a reporter at Boston 25 News' sister station in Charlotte, WSOC, that first mechanical problems and then a group of people refusing to wear masks left them stranded in the Queen City.This weekend was projected to be one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, and the airport expected to see almost as many travelers as it did pre-pandemic. Passengers on American Airlines Flight 893 to Nassau, Bahamas were in a position to depart Monday when a group of high school students decided to stage a mask rebellion that lasted for hours. American Airlines acknowledged the incident, saying the flight from Charlotte Douglas was delayed until Tuesday.

`/u/Americasycho` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ofhq5a/charlotte_flight_to_bahamas_canceled_when/):

> Flew outta Charlotte last October on a regional jet.
> 
> Woman boards and sits in front of me.  No mask on, puts on headphones, pulls up hoodie, no seatbelt and lowers seat as far back as it would go.  Plane fires up and the seatbelt sign is on.  In a flash, a no-nonsense flight attendant comes over and tells her to put up her seat, put on a seatbelt and put on a mask.  The woman argues back that she doesn't feel like it.  Flight attendant leans over and sticks a finger up to her face and says either comply or you'll be removed from the flight and banned.  The lady gives in and straightens up.  Whole flight she's bitching and videotaping the inside of the plane with her phone talking about a lawsuit.  Fuck all these people.

## USPS postal police say they have been confined to postal property instead of helping stop crimes

Summary of [original article](https://abc13.com/usps-postal-police-mail-theft-us-service-fraud/10863268/):

> Frank Albergo, president of the Postal Police Officer's Association, said officers have been sidelined by USPS since August 2020."Essentially, the postal service defunded the postal police force," Albergo said. Postal Police Officers play an important role in the protection of postal employees, postal assets and U.S. Mail within postal property. "The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has federal law enforcement officers, U.S. Postal Inspectors, who enforce approximately 200 federal laws that cover the misuse of the mail and attacks on the postal system, its employees, and its infrastructure. Criminal investigations, including those involving mail theft and assaults on letter carriers while they deliver mail to tens of millions of addresses each day, is the responsibility of Postal Inspectors, who are federal criminal investigators with broad statutory authority on and off of Postal real property."

`/u/FadeToPuce` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ofil69/usps_postal_police_say_they_have_been_confined_to/):

> B99 references aside I used to work for the USPS and the USPIS is no joke. They have jurisdiction over all kinds of stuff local cops and even a lot of federal agencies won’t touch. Someone used my address for a check cashing scheme once and they tracked those mfs to Jamaica. And frankly they were more courteous and professional than any other LEO I’ve *ever* encountered.
