## Black armed protesters march in Kentucky demanding justice for Breonna Taylor

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-louisville-idUSKCN24R025):

> LOUISVILLE, Kentucky - A group of heavily armed Black protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in March by police officers who burst into her apartment. Scores of the demonstrators, carrying semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and clad in black paramilitary gear, walked in formation to a fenced off intersection where they were separated by police from a smaller group of armed counter-protesters. Taylor's death, which returned to prominence following the May 25 suffocation in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, has become a rallying cry in nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12343977):

> Women who have alleged they were sexually assaulted by actor Danny Masterson have claimed The Church of Scientology tried to silence them. Previously, four women, including the three from the criminal charges, filed a civil suit against Masterson and the church, accusing the church of harassing them for having reported the ­alleged assaults to authorities. One of the lawyers for the civil suit, Stewart Ryan, said: "It is alleged that our clients reported the sexual assaults to Scientology at the times that they happened. It is alleged in the suit that Scientology attempted to cover up the sexual assaults."

## Hunger organization pushes out Yoho after Capitol incident

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/bb1a3ea90f8f218297eeb4735d91c000):

> WASHINGTON - A nonpartisan Christian organization that seeks to end hunger said Saturday it asked for and received the resignation of Rep. Ted Yoho from its board of directors following what it called his "Verbal attack" on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol. In a statement, Bread for the World said its board met Friday with Yoho and sought his resignation "As an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color, nationally and globally, as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world."

## Car drives through Black Lives Matter protest in Aurora, Colorado

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/car-drives-through-black-lives-matter-protest-in-aurora-colorado):

> The Aurora Police Department said on Twitter that protesters were walking on Interstate 225 Saturday when a vehicle drove through. Police closed streets and set up barricades to keep the two groups apart as tensions remained high in a town where protests have flared for months over the death of Taylor, a black woman killed when police burst into her apartment in March. The only confrontation among the competing groups appeared to occur earlier Saturday when white militia members and Black Lives Matter activists yelled at each other over the police barricades.

`/u/LuminousJSoul` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hy1r4q/car_drives_through_black_lives_matter_protest_in/):

> Honestly, if you think this is justifiable for the person in the car to drive in a crowd to intentionally seriously injure or kill someone, get some help. No deserves to get critically injured or killed for this for fuck sakes. Get out of your little political fantasy land and understand these are real ass people with families.
