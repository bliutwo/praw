## Theodore McCarrick, ex-cardinal and Archbishop of Washington D.C., to face sex abuse charges in Boston court

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/theodore-mccarrick-ex-cardinal-archbishop-sexual-abuse-boston-court/?__twitter_impression=true&s=09):

> Theodore McCarrick, the former Archbishop of Washington D.C., pleaded not guilty on Friday to child sex abuse charges. Now 91, McCarrick appeared in court for an arraignment Friday morning at the Dedham District Court outside Boston, using a walker. Even more damning for the church was a Vatican report published last year that revealed that John Paul II, the pope who made McCarrick a cardinal and archbishop of Washington D.C., knew about the allegations, but ignored them.

> In 2002, upon returning from a sex-abuse summit at the Vatican, he even claimed to champion the cause of abuse victims, declaring that "from now on, anybody who is credibly accused will never work in the U.S."

## U.S. Civil Engineers Bent the Rules to Give New Orleans Extra Protection from Hurricanes. Those Adjustments Might Have Saved the City During Ida

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/6094221/hurricane-ida-engineering-protection/):

> In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in late August 2005, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was tasked with building a new flood-defense network. According to a former senior official in the Army Corps who worked on the project, the engineers designing new flood barriers in New Orleans stretched their calculations such that they would lead to the construction of better protection than a strictly by-the-book approach might have entailed. So the engineers tasked with designing and building the city's new defenses fudged the numbers so that their work would actually protect New Orleans from the inevitable.

`/u/thinkfire` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ph0xcy/us_civil_engineers_bent_the_rules_to_give_new/):

> Title is misleading.
> 
> Should read that they "went beyond minimum code requirements".  Not that they "bent the rules".

## New policy for school district after Venice chiropractor signs 500+ mask exemptions Sarasota students

Summary of [original article](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/2021/09/01/sarasota-tightens-mask-rule-after-venice-chiropractor-signs-exemptions/5655950001/):

> A chiropractor in Venice provided more than 500 medical exemption forms for children attending Sarasota County Schools who did not want to wear a mask. District staff began enforcing a new mask policy on Monday, requiring students to either wear a mask or provide a form signed by a licensed medical professional, stating that the child "Cannot wear a mask or a face shield due to a medical, physical or psychological contraindication." After the influx of forms signed by Busch, and amid rumors that his office was distributing pre-signed forms, Superintendent Brennan Asplen issued an updated mask exemption form Tuesday evening stating that exemption forms can only be signed by medical doctors, osteopathic physicians licensed or advanced registered nurse practitioners.

`/u/Torschlusspaniker` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ph5bp1/new_policy_for_school_district_after_venice/):

> Busch "is interested to know whether the School Board will adopt a policy to no longer accept school physicals from chiropractors?" Keller wrote in an email. "It seems that if the School Board is taking the position that chiropractors are unqualified to sign the mask exemption forms, then it goes without saying they are likewise unqualified to determine whether a student is physically fit enough to participate in school athletics. Perhaps the School Board can clarify its position on this in the future."
> 
> They are not qualified to do that too. Fucking quack thinks he is a real doctor.

> A necessary political sacrifice to make. DeSantis requires many people to die while he triples down on his mistakes. Admitting he is wrong and the science is right would ruin his political aspirations.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "Stealing a pet is an awful crime which can cause families great emotional distress whilst callous criminals line their pockets."The new offence of pet abduction acknowledges that animals are far more than just property and will give police an additional tool to bring these sickening individuals to justice. RSPCA chief executive Chris Sherwood said the new pet abduction offence would recognise the "seriousness" of the crime, adding: "We hope this will encourage courts to hand out much tougher sentences to pet thieves.
