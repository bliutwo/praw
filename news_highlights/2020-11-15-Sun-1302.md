> With Mr Biden leading Mr Trump by wide margins in key battleground states, none of those issues would have any impact on the outcome of the election. Mr Trump's campaign has also filed legal challenges complaining that their poll watchers were unable to scrutinise the voting process. Many of those challenges have been tossed out by judges, some within hours of their filing.

## Sex-Abuse Claims Against Boy Scouts Now Surpass 81,000

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/us/boy-scouts-abuse-claims-bankruptcy.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage):

> In a statement, the Boy Scouts of America said the organization was "Devastated by the number of lives impacted by past abuse in Scouting." The organization said it had sought an accessible process for survivors to seek compensation. Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts grew under a rare congressional charter in 1916 that detailed scouting values of "Patriotism, courage, self-reliance and kindred virtues" - goals that shaped the civic ideals for generations of American boys. In 2017, the organization expanded to allow girls to participate, although that effort has frayed relationships with the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.But even in the organization's early years, abuse files maintained at the Boy Scouts headquarters detailed troubles.

> I do wonder if this is just indicative of the number of pedophiles there are. Is this just within the numbers that we see from any other organization where adults and children interact (church for example)?  
> 
> Either way we need to get to the bottom on catching these people wherever they are but I don't get the sense the boy scouts is a feeding ground for pedophiles.

`/u/nachochease` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jumzo5/exclusive_drugmakers_offer_canada_c1_billion_to/):

> This isn't really about the Canadian drug market, which is relatively small, it's about the pharmaceutical industry not wanting their American consumers realizing how badly their getting screwed.  If enough Americans realize they're massively overpaying for prescription medication, they might demand drug reform from their politicians, and that *terrifies* the industry.

> America is the pharmaceutical industry's cash cow -totally unregulated- and they'll spend billions to maintain the status quo.
