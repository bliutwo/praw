> I hate it for everyone.
> 
> Vets who went over there and came back changed, some of whom had their friends literally die in their arms. The same vets who also missed many life events back home, and ones who would never come home.
> 
> The civilians in Afghanistan impacted by all of this, and the ones caught in the crossfire who paid for being in the wrong place at the wrong time with their life.
> 
> The interpreters who face harsh punishment if they cannot leave.
> 
> And the people of the United States, who could have benefited more from $2,400,000,000,000 spent domestically.
> 
> At the end of the day, it’s reprehensible that people damn well old enough to remember Vietnam let this go on as long as it did, just to line their pockets. We had to rip the band aid off sooner or later, but this entire debacle is the fault of each administration going back to George W. Bush.

## Masks ordered for most Florida students, defying DeSantis

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/health-florida-coronavirus-pandemic-1f88ce7bdcbd971191a71ab8ffd3ac27):

> A majority of school board members in Orange County told the superintendent on Tuesday to require most students to wear masks, and agreed with her recommendation to keep the mandate through Oct. 30.The district began its school year this month with a parental opt-out, but a surge in students across the Orlando area testing positive for COVID-19 has disrupted classes. ADVERTISEMENT.At least 10 school boards making up some of the largest districts in Florida are now defying the DeSantis administration's attempt to ban local mandates on masks in schools. On Wednesday morning, police said the father of a student who tried to enter Fort Lauderdale High School without a mask was arrested after he forcefully pushed another student who tried to grab his cellphone.

`/u/SheriffComey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/pbdn22/masks_ordered_for_most_florida_students_defying/):

> >Just over half of Florida’s 2.8 million public school students now face mandates to wear masks in classrooms as a courtroom battle continues over efforts by Gov. Ron DeSantis to leave such decisions up to parents.
> 
> DeSantis picked the wrong fucking battle here.   Even worse if he actually acts on holding funding for the districts and the federal government makes it up. 
> 
> I know he's pandering to the nutters, but this really tells me he's not looking at 2022 anymore but rather 2024.   Dude won by 36k votes and if you believe Florida's official numbers, 41+k have died.   And the blue counties have a much higher vaccination rate than the red ones.

> I knew this would be about those two scam artists. How either of them aren't in jail yet blows my mind. Jacob is the worst. He also tried to frame Robert Mueller, Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wohl) some of his endeavors. He started his legacy by creating a fake hedge fund in high school and scamming people out of money, but as you'd expect he just kept doing worse and worse stuff. To note: He still has to face the judge on that ( and still owes money ) and is banned for life from the NFA from ever trading again. Also, someone did a nice 2 part documentary on these two as well [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iggVHtOwq64). It's much more informative than my reddit synopsis. His father David is also something else. It's not hard to see why Jacob turned out like this.
