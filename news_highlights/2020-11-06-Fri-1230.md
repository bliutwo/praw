## Georgia secretary of state says state will head to a recount

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-election-2020-likely-recount/):

> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger told reporters on Friday that the state will likely head to a recount due the small margin between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Trump. Biden pulled ahead in the state by a narrow margin of just over 1,000 votes as of Friday morning. Gabriel Sterling, the state's Voting System Implementation Manager, told reporters that there are 4,169 outstanding ballots in the state.

`/u/ImBieksa` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jp8a9t/georgia_secretary_of_state_says_state_will_head/):

> Dont need to freak out. The margin is too close and it is normal to ask for recount. 
> 
> The recount will not take as much time as initial counts because all the ballots are actually there. 
> 
> Just that GA may not even matter if Biden won by a large cushion in electoral vote
> 
> Let them recount, this is a democracy country, let them exercise their rights within the law of democracy.

## Philly police investigating alleged plot to attack Pennsylvania Convention Center

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/philly-police-investigating-alleged-plot-to-attack-pa-convention-center/7689932/):

> PHILADELPHIA - Philadelphia police are investigating an alleged plot to attack the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia on Thursday night. Action News has learned that police got a tip about a group, possibly a family, driving up from Virginia in a Hummer to unleash an attack at the Convention Center where votes are being counted in Philadelphia. The Trump campaign tried to stop the count in Philadelphia itself - alleging city officials were depriving their observers of meaningful access - but a federal judge refused to go along, instead urging the sides to forge an agreement.

`/u/Tigergasse1821` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/joyvq1/philly_police_investigating_alleged_plot_to/):

> Okay this is absolutely terrifying. I have been working at the convention center for the past three days and to know that I could be killed because some lunatic wants to impede the lawful counting of ballots is insane. Nothing is going to stop Philadelphia from finishing the count. You can bet my ass will be there bright early to continue despite Trumps efforts to slow down/stop the counting in the courts

> Published November 5 at 7:53 PM. The Portland Police Association filed a grievance against the city of Portland on Thursday night arguing that Measure 26-217, which passed with overwhelming support on Tuesday, needed to be negotiated with the union before the measure was referred to voters. On Tuesday night, Portland voters passed Measure 26-217 by 81.6% to 18.3%. The measure, championed by Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, will dissolve the city's current police oversight board and establish a new one. "The people of Portland overwhelmingly passed a measure calling for reforms to our police accountability system," Wheeler said.

> 
> Yeah the police should be the only ones who aren't accountable to anyone, this is completely unfair.
