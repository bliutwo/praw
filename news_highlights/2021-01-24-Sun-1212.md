## 33 missing children rescued in Los Angeles trafficking operation

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/33-missing-children-rescued-los-angeles-trafficking-operation-n1255435?fbclid=IwAR0Xyu9r8liCLMcnlT6kkFJbzvCyfrLfEu2fjGYrxI0PN5NaiKZ4SiHrfjU):

> Two of the victims had been recovered multiple times while at a location known for commercial sex trafficking. Federal investigators worked with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and two dozen other law enforcement agencies. "Human trafficking is a pervasive and insidious crime that threatens the safety of our young people, who are the future of our communities," said Michel Moore, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.

`/u/Forgotten-Irrelevant` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l3sa06/33_missing_children_rescued_in_los_angeles/):

> Since they mention a lot of the victims "willingly" going back I assume these are probably older children. If I had to guess I'd say this is probably a prostitution organization that preys on teenage girls who have no other prospects in life.

## US reaffirms Taiwan support after China sends warplanes

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/beijing-taiwan-china-asia-pacific-84d71bb4987cbf23b3aa5c07014d9a93):

> "We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives," spokesperson Ned Price said in the statement. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said China on Saturday sent eight bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons and four fighter jets into airspace just southwest of the island, part of a long-standing pattern of Chinese incursions aimed at pressuring the government of President Tsai Ing-wen into caving to Beijing's demand that she recognize Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory. China's increased threats come as economic and political enticements bear little fruit, leading it to stage war games and dispatch fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on an almost daily basis toward the island of 24 million people, which lies 160 kilometers off China's southeast coast across the Taiwan Strait.

`/u/DarkHorseMechanisms` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/l3zd4g/us_reaffirms_taiwan_support_after_china_sends/):

> To those worried, although this seems bad I think it’s typical response-testing behaviour... hope I’m not wrong there.

> It's easy to show he's a liar by comparing states with and without tipped minimum wages. The prices are virtually identical when I look at the menus on yelp for a $2.13/hr tipped minimum wage state vs a $12/hr minimum wage state. Both are overpriced for that crap food.
