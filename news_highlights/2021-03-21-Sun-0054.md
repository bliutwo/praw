> I'm pretty tired of seeing articles like this where the title, and to an extent the text, implies that there was some sort of sex dungeon the cops raided before pulling 16 children from cages.   Looks like this was several different cases that they are now bundling together into a single "operation" so that the cops get to look like they busted some sort of giant underground pedo mafia.   The story doesn't go into a lot of detail but reading between the lines this seems to be more a case of "We decided to actually put a little bit of effort into looking for these missing kids from poor background and were pretty much immediately able to find 16 of them."
