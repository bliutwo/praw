## Iowa abortion law requiring 24-hour waiting period permanently blocked by district court

Summary of [original article](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2021/06/22/iowa-court-permanently-blocks-law-abortion-restriction-24-hour-waiting-period/5305613001/):

> In his order, filed Monday afternoon, District Court Judge Mitchell Turner held that the 2020 law is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced on two grounds: that the legislature violated the "Single-subject rule" of the Iowa Constitution when they passed the measure as an amendment to an unrelated bill; and that the law violates a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court decision that protects abortion rights. Turner also found the law was barred by a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that found women have a fundamental right to receive an abortion under the Iowa Constitution. The Iowa Legislature has passed several abortion restrictions in recent years, including a 72-hour waiting period to receive an abortion, which was struck down in court, resulting in the Supreme Court's 2018 decision establishing abortion as a constitutional right.

> The Iowa legislature has a single-subject rule for bills that go through their legislature. This abortion law was an amendment sneaked onto an unrelated bill at the last minute. So rather than remove this amendment and put it forward as its own bill like the legislative rules require, the Republicans voted to suspend the rules specifically to allow it, then voted to reinstate the rules after the bill passed.

> My boss called me into his office last Friday and gave me the “you need to pick up the pace” talk. I work in tax accounting, for those of you that don’t know, the past 16 or so months have been hell with the primary contributor being that tax season hasn’t really stopped since it started in December 2019. In our meeting, I mentioned to my boss that I was having a hard time staying motivated as I was very burnt out; his response was “we all deal with things in our lives and we shouldn’t be bringing it to work, so you need to suck it up and think over the weekend about if you truly want your position here or not.” Nothing like having your only recharge time for the week get torpedoed so you end up stressed for the whole weekend.

> I fucking hate public accounting

## Fauci declares delta variant ‘greatest threat’ to the nation’s efforts to eliminate Covid

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/fauci-declares-delta-variant-greatest-threat-to-the-nations-efforts-to-eliminate-covid.html):

> Fauci's comments come after CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Friday urged Americans to get vaccinated against Covid, saying she expects delta to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the U.S. Studies suggest it is around 60% more transmissible than alpha, which was more contagious than the original strain that emerged from Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The United Kingdom recently saw the delta variant become the dominant strain there, surpassing alpha, which was first detected in the country last fall. The delta variant now makes up more than 60% of new cases in the U.K. Health officials say there are reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions.

> I work intimately with COVID pts. I was really close to leaving healthcare altogether in the spring. I had one particularly bad week where I saw one too many deaths, and I was just done. Doing "all the things" for these pts, knowing they're gonna die anyway? That shit wears on you.
> 
> I'm hoping the vaccination rate catches up before the winter, but I'm a little worried. But this winter, if it comes down to who gets the ventilator, I think the unvacced people w/ no co-morbidities should be second priority.

## A coronavirus outbreak hit a Florida government building. Two people are dead but a vaccinated employee wasn't infected

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/florida-manatee-county-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html):

> Two people are dead and four of their coworkers were hospitalized after a Covid-19 outbreak swept through a government building in Manatee County, Florida. The outbreak began in the IT department, according to Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes, who is also an epidemiologist. Another person who worked on the same floor but in a different department also tested positive for coronavirus last week.
