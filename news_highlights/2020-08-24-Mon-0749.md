Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/2c690094065ece9ba147feb4b18812d2):

> The New York and Missouri attorneys general, as well as the Federal Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission, filed complaints alleging Bakker engaged in deceptive practices by touting purported health benefits of a silver product on The Jim Bakker Show - including a suggestion it could be used to treat or prevent COVID-19 infection, something the FDA says is false. Bakker's co-counsel is Jay Nixon, a former four-term Missouri attorney general and two-term Democratic governor. Bakker, wife Lori and daughter Maricela Bakker Woodall, who serves as president of Morningside Church Productions, appealed for donations during a show which aired April 20.

## Britney Spears Offered Support By The ACLU In Conservatorship Battle

> Her mother wrote a book called Through the Storm that talks about all of the alcoholism and abuse Britney's father put the family through, and to think he is now in control of her entire life is mind blowing. Guardianship abuse is a very real thing that gets almost zero news coverage. His wife is estranged, Britney is estranged, Britney's sons have a restraining order against him for physically abusing one of them last year. It doesn't make any sense why this alcoholic abuser has been given full control of not only her money, but decisions like her food, medication and relationship arrangements. Earlier in the year, her son was on Instagram Live and when someone asked about his grandfather, he said "he's a piece of shit. He can go fucking die." She can't even hire an attorney to fight it because she has been deemed incompetent to hire legal counsel. It's disgusting.

## Kellyanne Conway to leave the White House at the end of the month, citing the need to focus on her family

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house/2020/08/23/6c26e18a-e5a7-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html):

> Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Trump and one of his longest-serving aides, is leaving the White House at the end of the month. Conway outlasted many of her colleagues from the campaign and the White House to become one of Trump's longest-serving aides, proving herself to be a survivor in a workplace that has had historical levels of turnover. The Conways became an object of fascination as George Conway ramped up his criticism of the president in 2018 while Kellyanne Conway remained a top adviser to Trump.
