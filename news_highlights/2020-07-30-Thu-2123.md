## Washington DC will not reopen school buildings in fall

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/washington-dc-reopen-school-buildings-fall-72082086):

> Bowser had initially planned to use a hybrid model with most students attending classes inside school buildings two days per week. Bowser said the decision was due to a combination of virus metrics, parental concerns and opposition from the teacher's union to opening up public school buildings. The Washington Teachers' Union, which had been promoting the Twitter hashtag #OnlyWhenItsSafe, said in a Thursday tweet that, "DC Teachers are willing to return to in-person learning, if health and safety concerns are addressed to ensure the health of our teachers, students and communities. In the meantime, we're committed to ensuring great virtual learning for our students."

## McDonald's CEO says restaurants "might bring in law enforcement" if customers refuse to comply with mask policy

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-mask-policy-ceo/):

> While Walmart and CVS have said they will be limiting their enforcement of the mask mandate, Kempczinski did not rule out the possibility of getting authorities involved if a situation in which a customer refuses to wear a mask escalates. "If someone is unwilling to wear a mask and comply with our rules, that might be where we might bring in law enforcement," he said. Kempczinski said restaurants and crews have undergone training about how to "Explain to customers why we have the requirement," and the training included "Deescalation." In recent months, retail workers at various stores across the country have been attacked for trying to enforce mask mandates.

Related In early June, federal and state authorities charged three men with alleged ties to the movement, including Parshall, and accused them of a conspiracy to cause violence during protests in May in Las Vegas, the U.S. attorney's office said.

## Another cache of documents related to Ghislaine Maxwell expected to be released in coming days

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/cache-documents-related-ghislaine-maxwell-expected-released-coming/story?id=72068093):

> Dozens of previously sealed court documents from a now-settled civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell are expected to be publicly released in the coming days, igniting a fresh round of speculation about what details the records might contain about Jeffrey Epstein's alleged child sex-trafficking operation and about Maxwell's alleged role in the conspiracy. In a letter to the court on Wednesday, Maxwell's attorneys contended that she was set up in a "Perjury trap" by federal prosecutors and lawyers for an alleged victim of Epstein and Maxwell. The court papers - potentially running into the thousands of pages - come from a defamation lawsuit filed in 2015 against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Maxwell recruited her as a 16-year-old into a life of sexual servitude to Epstein.
