## U.S. hospitalizations top 90,000 for the first time

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-hospitalizations-top-90000-united-states/):

> On Thanksgiving Day, hospitalizations hit a record high of more than 90,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project, and about 50 Americans are now dying every hour.
The true case count could be much higher, considering an expected dip in positivity rates linked to a surge in pre-holiday testing.
"A lot of people flooded into testing programs to get tested before they traveled for Thanksgiving," said Dr.
Emily Landon of the University of Chicago Medical Center, adding, "But they do bring the positivity rates down by flooding the testing market with a number of low risk individuals."

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/recount-in-wisconsin-county-demanded-by-trump-increases-bidens-margin-650492):

> A recount in Wisconsin's largest county demanded by Republican President Donald Trump's election campaign ended Friday with Democratic President-elect Joe Biden gaining votes.
Overall, Biden gained 257 votes to Trump's 125.Trump's campaign had demanded recounts in two of Wisconsin's most populous and Democratic-leaning counties, after losing Wisconsin to Biden by over 20,000 votes.
After the recount ended, Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said: "The recount demonstrates what we already know: that elections in Milwaukee County are fair, transparent, accurate and secure." The Trump campaign is still expected to mount a legal challenge to the overall result in Wisconsin, but time is running out.

## This archbishop is about to become the first African American cardinal in Catholic history

`/u/ZalmoxisRemembers` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k2ptkm/this_archbishop_is_about_to_become_the_first/):

> This is a very sneaky title that will make uneducated people think something different. He is the first African AMERICAN Cardinal, aka this is the first time an African was made cardinal in AMERICAN Catholic institutions. There have already been multiple African born cardinals in Roman Catholicism. Peter Turkson is one and Francis Arinze is another. Francis actually almost became Pope in 2005 when Pope John Paul II died.
> 
> Edit: as an addendum for those of you pointing out the technical correctness of the title, my gripe with it was its lack of clarity, and in fact my gripe extends further into the article as nowhere in the article is this clarified for a reader.

> Something similar happened near me not long ago. Someone had locked themselves and a kid in a house. The cops were aware there was a hostage, but opened fire anyways and killed the hostage. When it was reported it was said in a way that blamed them for being there...when they were kidnapped.
