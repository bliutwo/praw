## Top Saudi official issued death threat against UN's Khashoggi investigator

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/23/top-saudi-official-issued-death-threat-against-uns-khashoggi-investigator?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other):

> A senior Saudi official issued what was perceived to be a death threat against the independent United Nations investigator, Agnès Callamard, after her investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In an interview with the Guardian, the outgoing special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings said that a UN colleague alerted her in January 2020 that a senior Saudi official had twice threatened in a meeting with other senior UN officials in Geneva that month to have Callamard "Taken care of" if she was not reined in by the UN.Asked how the comment was perceived by her Geneva-based colleagues, Callamard said: "A death threat. That was how it was understood." The Saudi group then left the room but, Callamard was told, the visiting senior Saudi official stayed behind, and repeated the alleged threat to the remaining UN officials in the room.

> I was initially kind of surprised to see that this story is *still* in the news, since I had thought that the matter had already been resolved (on the criminal law side, at least) by the DA vacating the convictions on every case that the two tainted chemists had worked on. Reading through the article, though, apparently the state is now moving to vacate *every single conviction* that *ever* came from that lab during the period that those two were working there, under the reasoning that the fact that they were able to operate for so long without getting caught was an indictment of the credibility of the management there.

Several weeks ago, the judge rejected a bail package in which lawyers for Maxwell offered to pledge $28.5 million toward bail, including $22.5 million belonging to Maxwell and her husband.

## Norway blocks Rolls-Royce's plan to sell engine maker to Russia

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rolls-royce-hldg-norway-russia/norway-blocks-rolls-royces-plan-to-sell-engine-maker-to-russia-idUSKBN2BF11U?il=0):

> 3 Min Read.OSLO - Norway will block Rolls-Royce from selling a Norwegian maritime engine maker to a Russian company on national security grounds, its justice minister told parliament on Tuesday. Relations between Norway and Russia, which share a border in the Arctic, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.That triggered more tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides and more frequent military manoeuvres. While corporate takeovers have been assessed from time to time, Norway had abstained from blocking any business transactions since the law came in, the government's NSM security agency said this month.

> Yeah we probably shouldn't sell that to Russia. That's how Russia got their hands on the jet engine. They didn't need spys, they just asked Britain to sell them one.
