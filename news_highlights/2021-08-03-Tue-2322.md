> During WWII, one thing they do not talk about when discussing "The Greatest Generation" is the blatant bigotry that was directed towards black soldiers, sailors, and marines.  In areas where there were segregated black units were stationed closely with white units - England, Italy, and Australia - there were incidents of racial violence directed towards black service members.
> 
> In England, the Brits were shocked b the bigotry shown by white US servicemen towards black servicemen.  At Port Chicago, California, black navy seamen were forced to load munitions for the Pacific war and directed by white officers to violate explicit safety regulations - until a munitions ship exploded in 1944 killing and injuring hundreds.  The white officers were not punished.  Afterwards, 50 black seamen were court-martialed and imprisoned for refusing to work under unsafe conditions.
