## No students in class until January? Yes, one N.J. union leader says in urging big delay.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nj.com/education/2020/07/no-students-in-class-until-january-yes-one-nj-union-leader-says-in-urging-big-delay.html):

> The local teachers' union president in Paterson says Gov. Phil Murphy should hold off on reopening school buildings until January, and possibly longer, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Opening schools in September will result in recurring shutdowns when students and staffers inevitably test positive for the coronavirus, McEntee said in arguing that all school districts, not just Paterson, should delay restarting classes. Murphy's spokesperson, Alyana Alfaro, did not directly address McEntee's request for a major delay in opening schools, but said the governor and the state education department "Have been in regular and near-daily communication with school administrators, unions, and parents as our state looks ahead to the 2020-2021 school year."

> It’s sure looking like no in person schooling for 2020-2021. The hard part is, the youngest students, let’s say K-2 or 3, how do you do online schooling for them? A lot of teachers I talk to think the youngest ones are going to need more guidance and support directly. I couldn’t imagine being a parent and plopping my kid down in front of a device for kindergarten, and then having to intervene to help them over and over because they haven’t a clue what to do.

## U.S. insurers explore officer coverage as police reform debate rages

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-police-insurance-focus/u-s-insurers-explore-officer-coverage-as-police-reform-debate-rages-idUSKCN24P1A8?il=0):

> U.S. insurers and brokers are starting to craft professional liability coverage for police officers, spurred on by signs that policymakers in some cities and states want to use a financial stick to curb police misconduct. Insurers could build on the handful of policies that already exist for police officers who become embroiled in police work while off duty, said Anne Marie Towle, an executive at broker Hylant Group Inc in Ohio, adding she believes the idea will become more mainstream. The bill faces stiff opposition from powerful police unions who say it would be costly for already-underpaid officers and make recruitment more difficult, but it underscores that the broader concept is starting to gain ground amid the raging debate on police reform.

> Chicago has spent almost three quarters of a billion dollars dealing with police  misconduct. I could see how municipalities would embrace pushing some of that liability on individual officers.

## Judge restricts force federal officers can use in Portland

Summary of [original article](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-protest-restraining-order-force-federal-officers/):

> UPDATE - U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon has temporarily curbed the use of force by federal officers deployed to Portland, restricting their interactions with legal observers and journalists observing nightly protests against police violence. Earlier in the day, during a hearing on the order, Simon said he was inclined to side with the plaintiffs, pointing to recent news reports of federal officers infringing on the rights of protesters: Chris David, a Navy veteran who was beaten with batons by federal officers as he tried to speak with them, and Donavan La Bella, who was shot in the head with an impact munition while holding a speaker above his head. "Those people were not journalists - I get that. There's no allegations those people were journalists and any allegation they were legal observers," Simon said. According to a filing for the case, there are 114 federal law enforcement officers in Portland protecting the federal facilities.
