## ERCOT Didn't Conduct On-Site Inspections of Power Plants to Verify Winter Preparedness

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/ercot-didnt-conduct-on-site-inspections-of-power-plants-to-verify-winter-preparedness/2555578/):

> NBC 5 Investigates has also learned that ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, did not conduct any on-site inspections of the state's power plants to see if they were ready for this winter season. As the outages roll into a fourth day Thursday, it's becoming very clear that many power plants, including the natural gas system that supplies those plants with fuel, were simply not insulated well enough to protect against the cold and that ERCOT was way off in its assumptions about the state's ability to weather a major winter storm. As NBC 5 Investigates was first to report Tuesday, ERCOT did not send inspectors into power plants last year to check to see if they were prepared for winter weather.

> Oh they did years ago after the last polar vortex, said they need to winterize and then promptly spent that money lobbying for deregulation instead. strangely you could link to the report on the TX government websites until today.

## Texas power outages stretch into third day as millions face freezing conditions

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-power-outage-ercot-grid-investigation/):

> Anger over Texas' power outages in the face of a record winter freeze continued to mount Wednesday as millions of residents in the energy capital of the U.S. remained shivering. In all, nearly 3 million customers in Texas still had no power Wednesday after historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up homes unaccustomed to such extreme lows, buckling the state's power grid and causing widespread blackouts. Making matters worse: Expectations that the outages would be a shared sacrifice by the state's 30 million residents quickly gave way to a cold reality as pockets in some of America's largest cities, including San Antonio, Dallas and Austin, were left to shoulder the brunt of a catastrophic power failure n subfreezing conditions that Texas' grid operators had known was coming.

`/u/ConsumeFudge` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lm390b/texas_power_outages_stretch_into_third_day_as/):

> Over 60 hours now for me in Austin without any power (except for one random hour Tues at 3am). While our people are suffering our leaders are failing us. Austin mayor did a press conference over Facebook live (while nobody has power or internet) telling people to conserve power, while he still had his accent lighting for his paintings on behind him. Cornyn was tweeting about Bill Gates conspiracy theories yesterday morning. Abbott is gaslighting people into thinking that renewable energy wind turbines are the problem. It's just a failure on a massive scale
> 
> Edit: now our hospitals are running out of water. One adult hospital is already evacuating and diverting patients. As we move into another night of freezing temperatures
