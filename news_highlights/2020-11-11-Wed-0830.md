Summary of [original article](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/postal-worker-admits-fabricating-allegations-of-ballot-tampering-officials-say/):

> A Pennsylvania postal worker whose claims have been cited by top Republicans as potential evidence of widespread voting irregularities admitted to U.S. Postal Service investigators that he fabricated the allegations, according to three people briefed on the investigation and a statement from a House congressional committee. Hopkins, 32, told investigators from the U.S. Postal Service's Office of Inspector General that the allegations were not true, and he signed an affidavit recanting his claims, according to the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation. The U.S. Postal Service said in a statement over the weekend that it had referred Hopkins' allegations to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Office of Inspector General.

> Whatever happened to the story of the California GOP setting up fake drop boxes? Is that kind of ballot harvesting not illegal?
> 
> Edit: I ask mainly because of Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) being one of the people charged with ‘finding fraud’. [His email about it](https://imgur.com/gallery/oTJBNEg) specifically claims that “ballot harvesting should never take place”. I would argue that’s what the California GOP did.

> Splitting the vote via running recently unaffiliated candidates with the same last name as the Democrat runners. Give you one guess what party they were before they became unaffiliated.
> 
> I'm guessing this isn't technically illegal, which makes it easily fair play to people that have a disdain for democracy.

## Tom Metzger Dies at 82; Notorious KKK Boss, Supremacist Who Ran for Congress

Summary of [original article](https://timesofsandiego.com/life/2020/11/10/tom-metzger-dies-at-82-notorious-kkk-boss-supremacist-who-ran-for-congress/):

> Nick Martin, editor of The Informant, which covers hate and extremism in America, tweeted: "If David Duke is America's best-known white supremacist in the past 40 or so years, then Tom Metzger was arguably No. 2. His influence on organized racism in the US was large, and he even had sway with a number of young neo-Nazis in recent years." Metzger in 1980 won a three-man Democratic Party primary for Congress in San Diego's 43rd District, leading the party to disavow his candidacy and endorse his opponent, Republican Clair Burgener. Tammy Gillies, San Diego-based regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Times of San Diego: "A dark chapter of hate closes with the passing of Tom Metzger - a notorious figure who helped to poison the hearts and minds of others with his xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry. We can now relegate him to the dustbin of history and take a collective breath."

> For anyone curious, law enforcement is one of the most popular career choices for teens with deviant behavior. It’s an easy way to control power over other people, and allowed to be abusive towards people as well. 
> 
> This all adds up to a lot of cops being dicks.
