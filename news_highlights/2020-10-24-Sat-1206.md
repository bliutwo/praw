> She immediately began crying and the teacher allegedly threatened her.

> “Defendant VanHouten told her she needed to stop crying before she went back to her seat in the classroom, and if she told anyone what happened, that he would fail her for the year,” the suit states.
> 
> She remained in the storage area by herself until she regained her composure. When she returned to her seat, a friend noticed that she looked like she had been crying and asked what was wrong, to which the girl responded “nothing,” the suit continues."

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/delta-adds-460-passengers-who-refused-masks-no-fly-list-n1244573):

> Over 400 passenger won't be flying Delta anytime soon as a result of their alleged refusal to wear face masks during flights, according to an internal memo obtained by NBC News.In a letter to Delta employees Thursday, CEO Ed Bastian said that 460 customers who refused to wear face coverings amid the coronavirus pandemic were added to the airline's "No-fly list." "Wearing a mask is among the simplest and most effective actions we can take to reduce transmission, which is why Delta has long required them for our customers and our people," Bastian wrote as he announced the bans, encouraging staff to view two internal videos about their effectiveness. The Atlanta, Georgia-based airline - and many other U.S.-based carriers - began to require non-vented fabric face coverings during flights in May.The pandemic has already taken a grave toll on Delta and other airlines across the country, many of which began furloughing workers earlier this month when emergency relief funding lapsed without any new congressional funding.

> And mysteriously, Delta also notices a reduction in passengers who put their jackets and purses in the overhead bins instead of under the seats.
