## LeBron James' new nonprofit commits to pay fines for former felons looking to vote in Florida

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/lebron-james-nonprofit-commits-pay-fines-felons-vote/story?id=71975626):

> More Than A Vote, the voting rights group founded by LeBron James and other star athletes, is joining the fight over felon voting rights playing out in Florida. The battle over felon voting rights in Florida spilled outside the legislature and into the courts with voting rights organizations at odds with Republicans in the state over the law that narrowed the interpretation of the ballot measure. More Than A Vote was founded last month, in the wake of protests over the police killing of George Floyd, to encourage Black voters to head to the polls and combat voter suppression in the community.

> The major issue from what I read, is that Florida in many cases has no fucking clue how much some of these felons even owe. It's such a blatant attempt at voter suppression.

## Fauci says "serious threats" have been made against him and his wife and daughters

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-threats-wife-daughters-family/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=94959066):

> Fauci said the amount of hate mail and serious threats are "Not good." "Serious threats against me, against my wife, against my daughters. I mean, really? Is this the United States of America?" Fauci said. The Department of Justice confirmed in April that federal officials were ramping up security for Fauci after threats were made against him.

`/u/quantizedself` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hx6i7w/fauci_says_serious_threats_have_been_made_against/):

> >Fauci called the politicization of the coronavirus, "a reflection of the divisiveness in our society at the political level."
> 
> This eloquently sums it up.
> 
> Edit: By leveraging all the blame to one side you are further politicizing the issue. While fundamentally you are right, the way to approach this is to make the blanket statement of stop politicizing. This levels the playing field. If you were already at that level then great! And if not then now you are and we can talk eye to eye.
> 
> The thing that makes Dr Fauci's statement eloquent is that all of this subtext is there. Those of you railing against the Right, even justifiably, are just adding to the division.

Authorities on the federal and state levels said Icker, 31, of Throop, used his position as a police officer in Ashley, Sugar Notch and Jessup to try and sexually abuse as many as five women he pulled over while on duty.

> 15 years is not enough. The punishment is lenient for the crime committed. Sickening.

## Vermont governor mandates masks in public starting August 1st

Summary of [original article](https://vtdigger.org/2020/07/24/scott-orders-mask-mandate/):

> Scott has long resisted a mandate, saying that education is the best way to get people to wear masks when in public. Starting Aug. 1, masks will be required of anyone over the age of 2, unless the person has a physical or developmental disability that would be complicated by the wearing of one. Nationally, mask mandates vary widely, but most require masks in indoor spaces such as stores and restaurants, and outdoors when within 6 feet of others, the AARP said.

`/u/vtjake` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hxavxx/vermont_governor_mandates_masks_in_public/):

> A Vermonter will do anything they are asked, but nothing they are told.
> 
> They haven't needed though, lowest infection rate in the country.  They have just been asking people to do it as I understand and have gotten a high compliance rate. Now they are worried about return to school and influx of tourists/leaf peepers.

> I’ve heard the argument it’s not the state’s concern to protect federal constitutional rights. So I’m guessing they want us to ask the feds instead?
