> I hate it for everyone.
> 
> Vets who went over there and came back changed, some of whom had their friends literally die in their arms. The same vets who also missed many life events back home, and ones who would never come home.
> 
> The civilians in Afghanistan impacted by all of this, and the ones caught in the crossfire who paid for being in the wrong place at the wrong time with their life.
> 
> The interpreters who face harsh punishment if they cannot leave.
> 
> And the people of the United States, who could have benefited more from $2,400,000,000,000 spent domestically.
> 
> At the end of the day, it’s reprehensible that people damn well old enough to remember Vietnam let this go on as long as it did, just to line their pockets. We had to rip the band aid off sooner or later, but this entire debacle is the fault of each administration going back to George W. Bush.

## USDA to permanently boost food stamp benefits by 25 percent

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-9832ab299bd1a5953f305ec1ae2b8ea9):

> WASHINGTON - The Biden administration has approved a significant and permanent increase in the levels of food stamp assistance available to needy families-the largest single increase in the program's history. Starting in October, average benefits for food stamps will rise more than 25 percent above pre-pandemic levels. The aid boost is being packaged as a major revision of the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan.

> 
> > In concrete terms, the average monthly per-person benefits will rise from $121 to $157.
> 
> To qualify for food stamps, you generally must be at or below 130% of the poverty line. For a single person, that's about $16,744 a year, or for a family of three, that's $28,548 a year. These are the poorest Americans, who are [increasingly facing food insecurity and hunger due to the Coronavirus pandemic](https://www.feedingamerica.org/research/coronavirus-hunger-research). 36 dollars a month might not sound like a lot to us, but this increase in food stamp benefits is much-needed relief for tens of millions of Americans who may be going hungry during the pandemic.

## Taliban fighters executing surrendering troops, which could amount to war crimes, U.S. officials say

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-warning-taliban-fighters-committing-atrocities-amount-war/story?id=79424000):

> The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has also urged Americans to evacuate Afghanistan immediately, amid fears that the capital could fall into Taliban hands in a matter of weeks. A military analysis said the city could be isolated in 30 to 60 days and be captured in 90 days, a U.S. official told ABC News, but that timeline seemed even more accelerated Thursday as the Taliban claimed Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city. While the Taliban have previously denied reports that its fighters have executed Afghan troops, the U.S. embassy said Thursday it was "Hearing additional reports of Taliban executions of surrendering Afghan troops" and said they were "Deeply disturbing and could constitute war crimes."

`/u/rcarmack1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/p50tlw/taliban_fighters_executing_surrendering_troops/):

> This definitely could strain diplomatic relationships with the Taliban if this continues.

## US issues new terrorism threat warning ahead of 9/11 anniversary

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210814-us-issues-new-terrorism-threat-warning-ahead-of-9-11-anniversary):

> The US Department of Homeland Security issued a new terrorism threat advisory on Friday ahead of the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks and amid a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic. The new advisory updated a January alert following the attack on the US Congress by supporters of then-president Donald Trump, when DHS said the country faced "Increasingly complex and volatile" threats from anti-government and racially motivated extremists, often stirred up by online influence from abroad. The bulletin had already been amended in May, with DHS warning violent extremists could exploit the easing of Covid-19 restrictions to conduct attacks. DHS was established after 9/11 and regularly issues terrorism threat advisories.

> Sadly, when I read headlines like this anymore, I can no longer be certain if the threat is coming from outside the country or from within.
