> June 15, 2021.The Indian authorities launched an investigation after an internal government report concluded that some private agencies responsible for coronavirus testing on pilgrims at a sprawling Hindu festival forged at least 100,000 results. Officials in Uttarakhand began investigating the test results after a man in the neighboring state of Punjab received a negative test from the health department in Uttarakhand, even though he had not visited the state. The authorities said they found phone numbers used multiple times to register pilgrims who were tested, and private agencies carrying out the tests wrote fictional addresses for people who were supposedly tested on their arrival for a dip in the holy waters.

(At the same gd hospital too) Meanwhile, this dipshit got two new lungs because a free vaccination was just too much fucking trouble.  My family member wore his mask, followed all the rules and was in the very first group of folks to get the shots. This state and the absolute bottom rung idiots that live here…..  we might be fucked. And we might deserve it.

## Our only option’: Myanmar civilians take up arms for democracy

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/15/our-only-option-myanmar-civilians-take-up-arms-for-democracy):

> While ethnic armed groups have had years to develop resources and capacity, civilian defence forces are mostly armed with single-shot hunting rifles and other homemade weapons, and many fighters have had only a few weeks of combat training. "We have conducted nationwide protests and launched a civil disobedience movement against the military in hopes of restoring civilian democracy, but those methods alone didn't work," said Neino, a former university lecturer who is now leading the political arm of a civilian resistance group in Chin State and neighbouring Sagaing region. More protesters are joining rebel forces because they see it as the only way to restore democracy The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, made up of elected lawmakers overthrown in the coup, announced on March 14 its support for civilians' right to defend themselves, and on May 5, the CRPH-appointed National Unity Government announced the establishment of a national-level People's Defence Force, a precursor to a Federal Army which would unite the country's ethnic armed groups and civilian defence forces under a central command.

Summary of [original article](https://abc17news.com/money/2021/06/17/airline-and-bank-websites-go-down-in-another-major-internet-failure/):

> The outages come just over a week after countless websites and apps around the world went down for about an hour when Fastly, another major content delivery network, suffered a widespread failure. A spokesperson for Commonwealth Bank of Australia said "We are seeing services return following a tech outage which had widespread impacts across businesses." ANZ said the outage affected its app and internet banking platform, but services had been restored. Major website and app outages happen from time to time and typically don't last long - internet service providers, content delivery networks and other hosting services are built with multiple redundancies and a global network of backup servers designed to reduce disruptions when things go haywire.
