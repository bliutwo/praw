## Africa to be declared free of wild polio after decades of work

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/25/africa-to-be-declared-free-of-wild-polio-after-decades-of-work):

> Africa is expected to be declared free from wild polio, after decades of work by a coalition of international health bodies, national and local governments, community volunteers and survivors. Four years after the last recorded cases of wild polio in northern Nigeria, the Africa Regional Certification Commission is expected to certify that the continent is free of the virus, which can cause irreversible paralysis and in some cases death. Musbahu Lawan Didi, co-founder of Nigeria's Association of Polio Survivors, campaigning for the rights of those with polio , said: "It is incredible that what we have started years ago has built these results. As polio survivors we are the happiest and believe we'll be the last polio survivors in the country."

> KENOSHA, Wis. - A Black man shot multiple times, apparently in the back, by police in Wisconsin is paralyzed from the waist down and has "Eight holes" in his body, the father of victim Jacob Blake said. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned. Police did not say whether Blake was armed or why police opened fire, they released no details on the domestic dispute, and they did not immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene.

> Hopefully he finds a good rehabilitation center for his spinal cord injury. I was shot and paralyzed from the chest down (C8 complete spinal cord injury) a few years ago, and Craig Hospital in Denver was indispensable in making me continue to live a full and healthy life doing things I love. It’s an injury that’ll likely keep me in my wheelchair for life, but I’m incredibly lucky that I’m still here to enjoy it!

## Judge rules Apple can continue to block Fortnite from its App Store.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53902659):

> A US judge has ruled that, for now, Apple can continue to block the video game Fortnite from its App Store. Apple pulled Fortnite from the App Store after Epic deliberately broke its rules in protest at Apple's policies. Both removed Fortnite from their stores after Epic offered a discount on its in-game currency V Bucks if they were purchased on the website instead. On Monday, Microsoft backed Epic in the dispute.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday called on Russia to investigate the suspected poisoning of Navalny and to hold the perpetrators accountable after German doctors found indications of a toxic substance in his body. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the German clinic had not conclusively identified the substance behind Navalny's illness.

## Mum found dead beside malnourished baby in Glasgow flat

> A mum has been found dead beside her malnourished baby in a Glasgow flat. "The question remains, why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces? Does society have anything to say about that other than call them a drain on society?". The tragedy comes after Syrian man Adnan Olbeh was found dead at McLays Guest House in Garnethill in May, while a man was shot dead and six people were injured in a knife attack in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow city centre in June.
