## Former CIA officer arrested and charged with spying for China

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-spy/former-cia-officer-arrested-and-charged-with-spying-for-china-idUSKCN25D2H1):

> WASHINGTON - A former Central Intelligence Agency officer was arrested and charged with spying for China in a scheme that involved a relative who had also worked for the CIA, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday. It said in a statement that Alexander Yuk Ching Ma was arrested on Friday on a charge that he conspired with a relative, also a former CIA officer, to communicate classified information to Chinese intelligence officials. Prosecutors said the scheme began with three days of meetings in Hong Kong in March 2001, during which the two former CIA officers provided information to the foreign intelligence service about the agency's personnel, operations and methods of concealing communications.

> Maybe they already knew he was a spy and fed him false info. Reminds of the imitation game when one of the characters who’s trying to crack enigma tells his superiors that one of his colleagues is a soy. The superior’s reaction illustrates that he already knows that that individual is a spy but they still kept him on the team. It’s like that saying goes: keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer

## US chickens 'literally sitting in each other's waste' says RSPCA

`/u/Sergienechayev2` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ibfeys/us_chickens_literally_sitting_in_each_others/):

> When I was about 18 I worked in alot of chicken barns. Our job was to load/unload caged birds onto tractor trailers, vaccinate & beak. Horrible fucking job. There's about 12-14 birds per cage, stuffed so tight that they can barely turn around. The cages are stacked in rows, 5 rows high. The floor of each cage is steel grate, so each row showers shit and piss down onto the rows below. Finally beneath the bottom row (completely shit soaked birds) is a vat that catches all the shit/piss slurry and pipes it out to cess pool not far from the barn ( literally a lake of shit). The job was truly horrifying and robs you of all your senses except touch. Can't see cuz they keep it dark, can't smell anything except ammonia from the vats gassing off, can't hear cuz of the loud din of cackling, and since you're literally breathing in shit particulate it gets in your sinus and you taste a shit drip even on your day off. Not to mention the extreme heat in summer. I lasted 6 months. Most quit by lunch time on their first day and called for a ride or walked home. Couldn't eat chicken or eggs for about 5yrs after that.

## North Koreans 'forced to give up pet dogs for restaurant meat amid food shortages'

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/north-koreans-forced-to-give-up-pet-dogs-for-restaurant-meat-amid-food-shortages-12051212):

> People in North Korea are reportedly being forced to give up their pet dogs so they can be used as dog meat for restaurants. The source said: "Authorities have identified households with pet dogs and are forcing them to give them up or forcefully confiscating them and putting them down." Some of the dogs are being sent to state-run zoos or sold to dog meat restaurants, the source added.

`/u/KuhjaKnight` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ibjolc/north_koreans_forced_to_give_up_pet_dogs_for/):

> So, some fun facts for everyone:
> 
> After the pillaging of Korea around the 40’s and 50’s, the invaders tore out every tree and slaughtered almost every cattle animal on the peninsula. This led to widespread devastation of the populace. Almost every tree there was planted after 1950.
> 
> Due to the culling of livestock, the Koreans were forced to turn to stray animals for meat and basic food. The practice of eating canine is not new nor unique. It was born out of desperation and hunger of the entire country (even before the full on split). Dogs were easy to raise and slaughter, which led to the rise of dog meat as a staple in the South. Cattle is making a huge comeback and has been, due to imports, but canine is still considered a delicacy. However, most younger Koreans (35 and younger) look at dogs as pets and not food.
> 
> This turn in the North is not surprising. However, being forced to surrender it to a third party is interesting. The Koreas are a resilient people, but I’m curious how this will play out.
