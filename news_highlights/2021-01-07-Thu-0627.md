## NY Governor: Capital riots a ‘failed attempt at a coup,’ NY National Guard sent to D.C.

Summary of [original article](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/top-stories/cuomo-calls-d-c-riots-failed-attempt-at-a-coup/):

> ALBANY, N.Y. - Congress has confirmed Democrat Joe Biden as the presidential election winner, hours after violent protesters loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in what New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called a "Failed attempt at a coup." "We must call this what it actually is: a failed attempt at a coup. This is the final chapter of an incompetent, cruel, and divisive administration that has trampled on the Constitution and the rule of law at every turn, and we won't let President Trump, the members of Congress who enable him, or the lawless mob that stormed our nation's Capitol steal our democracy. The election results are clear and the will of the American people will be carried out." "At the request of United States National Guard officials, I am deploying 1,000 members of the New York National Guard to Washington, D.C. for up to two weeks to aid and facilitate the peaceful transition of presidential power" Gov. Cuomo said in a statement.
