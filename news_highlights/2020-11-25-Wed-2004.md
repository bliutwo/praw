## Diego Armando Maradona passed away.

Summary of [original article](https://www.clarin.com/deportes/murio-diego-armando-maradona-sufrio-paro-respiratorio-grave_0_hCcpbyiC-.html):

> Diego Armando Maradona murió este miércoles tras sufrir un paro cardiorrespiratorio en el barrio San Andrés, en el partido bonaerense de Tigre, donde se había instalado días atrás luego de la operación en la cabeza a la que fue sometido por un hematoma subdural. La sentencia que varias veces se escribió pero había sido gambeteada por el destino ahora es parte de la triste realidad: murió Diego Armando Maradona. En ese mismo montaje realizado en 2005 en su programa "La noche del Diez", el Diego de traje le propuso al de remera que deje unas palabras para cuando a Diego le llegue el día de su muerte.

## New Mexico passes $330 million coronavirus relief bill

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-mexico-passes-covid-relief-bill-330-million-dollars/):

> New Mexico lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that will deliver a one-time $1,200 check to all types of unemployed workers and up to $50,000 for certain businesses. Most of the proposed spending will be made possible by federal relief funding previously assigned to New Mexico, including around $319 million in unspent funds that were expected to expire soon. Republican lawmakers welcomed language in the bill that instructs the Finance Authority to make sure recipients are spread out geographically, and not concentrated in the tourism and Democrat-heavy cities of northern New Mexico.

> >	Most of the proposed spending will be made possible by federal relief funding previously assigned to New Mexico, including around $319 million in unspent funds that were expected to expire soon. An additional $10 million in state general funds were allocated for testing and tracing efforts.
> 
> So the state paid $10m and the country paid $319m for this state stimulus.  Why was $319m of direct federal stimulus money unspent until now is my follow-up question.  The point of federal stimulus payouts isn’t to hold them until expiration.

## Arkansas man receives racist letter about his Black Santa decorations

Summary of [original article](https://www.thv11.com/amp/article/news/local/man-receives-racist-letter-black-santa-decorations/91-6fedbe23-1b89-400c-8b4d-c38b7121f8ac):

> NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Chris Kennedy has lived in his Lakewood home in North Little Rock for three years, but on Tuesday afternoon he received a letter in the mail that he never expected to receive. Kennedy had an idea that the letter wasn't from the Lakewood Property Owners Association from the logo on the letter. Not only did LPOA give him a membership, but stated their thoughts on whoever sent the racist letter.

`/u/Tinmania` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k0rbv4/arkansas_man_receives_racist_letter_about_his/):

> > Other Lakewood neighbors like Dennis Smith agree.
> "It's done my heart good to see his displays for the last three years especially given who he lives next to," Smith said. "I hate it that their family's having to go through that but we've been praying for him." 
> 
> Sounds like this neighbor may have doxxed the letter writer, or someone equally racist.

> LASALLE, Ill. - State officials are investigating a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans nursing home in rural Illinois that has infected nearly 200 residents and staff, and killed 27 veterans.
