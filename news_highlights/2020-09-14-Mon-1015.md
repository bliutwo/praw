## 'Hundreds of thousands, if not millions': New Mexico sees massive migratory bird deaths

Summary of [original article](https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2020/09/12/mass-deaths-migratory-birds-new-mexico-environment/5780282002/):

> Over the past few weeks, various species of migratory birds are dying in "Unprecedented" numbers of unknown causes, reported Martha Desmond, a professor at NMSU's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology. "One thing we're not seeing is our resident birds mixed in with these dead birds. We have resident birds that live here, some of them migrate and some of them don't, but we're not getting birds like roadrunners or quail or doves." The biologists noted that the majority of the dying birds are insectivores, but that seed eaters were sickening and dying as well.

`/u/AleHans` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/isfz0m/hundreds_of_thousands_if_not_millions_new_mexico/):

> I’m a fly fishing guide here in the high Rockies of Colorado,  seen dozens of dead migratory birds along the river and in parking lots over the past couple days.  I was thinking it had to do with the recent cold front that pushed through.  Sad to hear.
