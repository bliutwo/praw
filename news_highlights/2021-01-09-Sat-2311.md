## Amazon to drop Parler from its web hosting service, citing violent posts

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/09/amazon-drops-parler-from-its-web-hosting-service.html):

> Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, informed Parler on Saturday that it will no longer provide cloud services to the company beginning on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. PT, according to an email obtained by CNBC. AWS provides cloud services to Parler that host its website, which means that if Parler can't locate a new cloud provider by Sunday night, the site will go offline for its users. In the email, Amazon Web Services' Trust and Safety team told Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff that the platform continues to host "Violent content" that violates AWS' terms of service. AWS told Parler in the email that it had flagged 98 examples to Parler of posts that "Clearly encourage and incite violence." Among the posts it reported to Parler, which were viewed by CNBC, users on the platform made violent threats directed at "Liberal leaders, liberal activists #blm leaders and supporters," in addition to other groups.

> Parler is in a catch-22. They can lose their users because they decide to start moderating comments calling for assassinations and terrorism, or they can lose their users because they don't moderate and nobody wants to host them.

> Before the free speech purists get here: AWS wouldn't host ISIS websites promoting terrorism, [Twitter has banned](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2016/an-update-on-our-efforts-to-combat-violent-extremism.html) hundreds of thousands of ISIS accounts, and [Facebook has an AI](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-using-a-i-artificial-intelligence-against-terrorism/) to detect and remove terrorist activity. Didn't hear any complaints about free speech then.

## Apple removes Parler from App Store in wake of U.S. Capitol riot

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/09/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store-in-wake-of-us-capitol-riot.html):

> Apple removes apps regularly for violating its lengthy guidelines, and has previously banned apps popular with right-wing users, including the Infowars app in 2018, and before that, Qdrops, an app related to the Qanon conspiracy theory. In a message sent to Parler on Saturday, Apple said that the social media app was failing to moderate and remove content that encourages illegal activity, citing two Apple guidelines, one prohibiting objectionable content and one that requires apps with user-generated content to filter out potentially harmful posts. A previous message from Apple sent on Friday, reported by Buzzfeed, and posted in part by the Parler CEO on his account, cited a tweet from activist group Sleeping Giants with screenshots of the Parler app, including one where a user called on his followers to attend the inauguration "Carrying our weapons." Apple gave Parler 24 hours to add content moderation to its app or Apple would remove it.

`/u/fastinserter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ku01jx/amazon_employees_call_for_company_to_cut_ties/):

> It wasn't a riot, stop calling it a riot. They constructed a gallows. They chanted "hang Mike Pence". They attacked and forced their way into Congress while a joint session was going on, along with the VP. They brought knives, clubs, guns, zip cuffs, and bombs. They were trying to violently remove all opposition of our political leaders to Donald Trump. And they were encouraged by Donald Trump. This was an attempted coup. It failed, but this should be called for what it was, the MAGA Putsch.
> 
> So AWS should cut ties with Parler not because of its connection to a *riot* but for *trying to overthrow the United States government*. If they don't, perhaps section 230 does need to be revisited.

## Months ahead of Capitol riot, DHS threat assessment group was gutted: Officials

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/months-ahead-capitol-riot-dhs-threat-assessment-group/story?id=75155673):

> Had the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis been operating at full capacity over the previous months, the officials said, U.S. Capitol Police would have had a clearer picture of the "Specific and credible" threats of violence posed by groups planning to attend Wednesday's rally. In a statement to ABC News, a DHS intelligence and analysis spokesperson said the agency "Has produced numerous intelligence reports highlighting the heightened threat environment during the 2020-2021 election season, including the extent to which the political transition and political polarization are contributing to the mobilization of individuals to commit violence." Another former intelligence official who asked to remain anonymous echoed Neumann's concern that the absence of intelligence on Wednesday reflected a "Breakdown in DHS' ability to carry out its core mission."

> MONTREAL - The Twitter account of conspiratorial influencer Alexis Cossette-Trudel was suspended on Friday, the same day that several conspiracy theorists from the QAnon movement were also banned from the social network. Several Twitter accounts linked to the QAnon movement promoted Wednesday's demonstration on the US Capitol, a protest that turned into a deadly insurgency and which prompted Twitter to adopt new measures. The coronavirus pandemic has breathed new life into QAnon theories and accounts associated with conspiracy theorist YouTubers like Cossette-Trudel.

Mr. Meredith, whose current hometown was unavailable, told federal agents that he had been traveling from Colorado and had arrived too late for Wednesday's rally in Washington.
