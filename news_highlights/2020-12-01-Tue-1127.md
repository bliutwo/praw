## Articles of Impeachment officially filed against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, claiming abuse of power during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleveland19.com/2020/11/30/articles-impeachment-officially-filed-against-ohio-gov-mike-dewine-claiming-abuse-power-during-pandemic/):

> TOLEDO, Ohio - A total of 12 Articles of Impeachment have officially been filed against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. The representatives argue that the governor has abused his power during the coronavirus pandemic and cites his veto of Senate Bill 55, along with threatened vetoes against other General Assembly legislation, including Senate Bill 311, which aims to severely limit the powers of the governor during a pandemic. In a release sent to the media, Rep. Becker's office said, "Governor DeWine's mismanagement, malfeasance, misfeasance, abuse of power, and other crimes include, but are not limited to, meddling in the conduct of a presidential primary election, arbitrarily closing and placing curfews on certain businesses, while allowing other businesses to remain open. He weaponized the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation to bully and harass businesses and the people; to enforce a statewide mask mandate and other controversial measures of dubious"value," making Ohio a hostile work environment.

> 
> > The representatives argue that the governor has abused his power during the coronavirus pandemic and cites his veto of Senate Bill 55, along with threatened vetoes against other General Assembly legislation, including Senate Bill 311...
> 
> He is abusing his power by using the power given to him by the Ohio Constitution? If three-fifths of the Ohio legislature doesn't agree with the veto, they have the ability to override it. It's amazing how republicans always claim to believe in the law, until the law doesn't work in their favor.
> 
> Trying to impeach their own Governor for trying to protect the public during a pandemic might be a new low for a party that has made a habit of going as low as possible.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/coronavirus/michigan-couple-married-for-47-years-die-from-covid-19-on-the-same-day/5605599/):

> Just two days before Thanksgiving, a Michigan couple married for 47 years died from COVID-19. "It's beautiful, but it's so tragic. Kind of like Romeo and Juliet," their daughter, Joanna Sisk, told NBC affiliate WDIV. "One wouldn't have wanted to be without the other." Patricia McWaters, 78, who was known to friends and family as Pat, was a registered nurse and spent 35 years of her career working in the operating room at the Foote Allegiance Hospital in Jackson, Michigan, her hometown.

## Iconic Arecibo Observatory radio telescope collapses after cable broke

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arecibo-observatory-radio-telescope-puerto-rico-collapses/):

> A huge radio telescope in Puerto Rico that has long played a key role in astronomical discoveries collapsed on Tuesday, officials said. Then a main cable broke in early November, leading the National Science Foundation to declare just weeks later that it planned to close the radio telescope because the damage was too great. Operated by the National Science Foundation through the University of Central Florida, the iconic observatory was made up of a fixed 1,000-foot-wide dish antenna built into a bowl-like depression that reflects radio waves from space to a 900-ton instrument platform suspended 450 feet above by cables stretching from three support towers.

`/u/Andromeda321` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k4l480/iconic_arecibo_observatory_radio_telescope/):

> Radio astronomer here- this is a sad day for science. We will never see the likes of Arecibo again and I literally have colleagues crying right now, not just because of the science lost but because Arecibo was so close to many lives. (Many got their first start in the field at Arecibo through its student programs, I know at least one couple that met there, and it was iconic in Puerto Rican identity.)
> 
> FAQ, along with my post last week that addressed a lot of the questions then:
> 
> **What happened?** There was a cable break in August, followed by a main cable break holding the gigantic 900 ton feed horn (that James Bond ran on- or rather his stunt double, astronomers bragged Pierce Brosnan was too scared to do what they do every day), and it looks like the entire thing finally collapsed onto the dish below. It was the size of the house and where all the expensive equipment was. 
> 
> **Can they fix it?** No. This is the equivalent on an optical telescope of the bottom where your eyepiece/camera falling out and smashing a hole in the mirror. It’s gone. 
> 
> **Did they save any of the millions of dollars of equipment?** Again, no. It was far too dangerous to get into the horn once the main cable snapped and engineering reports indicate they were keeping people *very* far from it. For good reason based on this development...
> 
> **What happens now?** The NSF is under contract to return the telescope site to its original natural state so I guess the demolition will begin. There is not money or interest in rebuilding this magnificent engineering marvel. 
> 
> *Q&A from last week*
> 
> To answer some questions you might have:
> 
> **It's a 50 year old telescope- was it still doing good science?** Short answer: yes.  Arecibo has had a storied history doing a lot of great radio astronomy- while [its SETI days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) are behind it (it hasn't really done SETI in years) the telescope has done a ton of amazing science over the years- in fact, Arecibo gave us one Nobel Prize for the [discovery of the first binary pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1937%2B21) (which was the first indirect discovery of gravitational waves!).  More recently, Arecibo was [the first radio telescope on the planet to discover a repeating Fast Radio Burst \(FRB\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst#FRB_121102)- the newest class of weird radio signal- which was a giant milestone in our quest to understand what they are (we now think they are probably from a souped up type of pulsar, called a magnetar, thanks in large part to the work Arecibo has done).  Finally, Arecibo was also a huge partner in [nanoGRAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Nanohertz_Observatory_for_Gravitational_Waves)- an amazing group aiming to detect gravitational waves via measuring pulsars really carefully- so that's a huge setback there.
> 
> **Can't other radio telescopes just pick up the slack?** Yes and no.  [FAST in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope) is an amazing dish that's even bigger than Arecibo, so that'll be great, but right now is still pretty limited in the kind of science it can do.  Second, it doesn't really have the capability to transmit and receive like Arecibo does- Arecibo was basically the biggest interplanetary radar out there, and FAST has said they might do that but it's not currently clear the timeline on that- Arecibo would do this to update the shape and orbits of asteroids that might hit Earth someday using radar, for example, so we just don't have that capability anymore.
> 
> Beyond that, you could of course do *some* science Arecibo has been traditionally doing on telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBI), but those are oversubscribed- there are literally only so many hours in a day, and right now the VLA for example will receive proposals for 2-3x as much telescope time as they can give.  Losing Arecibo means getting telescope time is now going to be that much more competitive.
> 
> **Why don't we just build a bigger telescope?  One on the far side of the moon sounds great!** I agree!  But good Lord, Arecibo has been struggling for *years* because the NSF couldn't scratch together a few million dollars to keep it running, which probably led to the literal dish falling apart.  Do you really think a nation that can't find money to perform basic maintenance is going to cough up to build a radio telescope on the far side of the moon anytime soon?!  Radio astronomy funding has been *disastrous* in recent years, with our flagship observatories literally falling apart, and the best future instruments are now being constructed abroad (FAST in China, SKA in South Africa/Australia).  Chalk this up as a symbol for American investment in science as a whole, really...
> 
> So yeah, there we have it- it's a sad day for me.  I actually was lucky enough to [visit Arecibo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/d49tz7/i_think_im_going_to_need_a_bigger_antenna/) just over [a year ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/4oW7RTr) (on my honeymoon!), and I'm really happy now that I had the chance to see the telescope in person that's inspired so much.  And I'm also really sad right now because science aside, a lot of people are now going to lose their jobs, and I know how important Arecibo was to Puerto Rico, both in terms of education/science but as a cultural icon.
> 
> TL;DR this is a sad day for American science.  We will definitely know a little less about the universe for no longer having the Arecibo Observatory in it.
