## Hundreds of Google Employees Unionize, Culminating Years of Activism

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html):

> The new union, called the Alphabet Workers Union after Google's parent company, Alphabet, was organized in secret for the better part of a year and elected its leadership last month. Unlike a traditional union, which demands that an employer come to the bargaining table to agree on a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union is a so-called minority union that represents a fraction of the company's more than 260,000 full-time employees and contractors. Chewy Shaw, an engineer at Google in the San Francisco Bay Area and the vice chair of the union's leadership council, said the union was a necessary tool to sustain pressure on management so that workers could force changes on workplace issues.

## Covid deniers removed from at capacity hospital

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-55531589):

> Security officers removed Covid-19 "Deniers" who were taking pictures of empty corridors at a NHS hospital where the intensive care unit is at maximum capacity, its chief executive said. Chief executive Nick Hulme said it "Beggars belief" some people were calling the pandemic a hoax. Mr Hulme said hospital security had to "Remove people who were taking photographs of empty corridors and then posting them on social media, saying the hospital is not in crisis".

## DC says no guns allowed during MAGA election protest

Summary of [original article](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dc-says-no-guns-allowed-during-maga-election-protest):

> It's the latest in a series of conservative protests to the November election results set in the nation's capital. Trump's calls to protest the election have also reached the U.S. Senate, where a group of Republican senators including Sen. Ted Cruz now say they will object to certifying the election results unless there is an emergency audit. Trump's efforts to overturn the election results extend beyond litigation, though.

`/u/FunkyTownMonkeyClown` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/kq2i47/dc_says_no_guns_allowed_during_maga_election/):

> Good luck with that. They will say it's a constitutional infringement, and they'll have them anyway. I'd be inclined to agree.

## Netherlands refuses entry to UK nationals for non-essential travel

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/netherlands-refuses-entry-uk-nationals-non-essential-travel-brexit-coronavirus):

> More than a dozen UK nationals have been refused entry to the Netherlands since 1 January because Britain is no longer exempt from Covid-related restrictions on non-essential travel from outside the EU since it left the bloc. European nationals and British citizens living in the EU can still travel from the UK to the bloc with a recent negative test and proof of residence, while EU member states can in theory override the European council recommendations should they wish to. Few have meaning that as long as the restrictions remain in place, British nationals can now only enter the bloc in certain cases, mainly for urgent family reasons, study, or work - including aid workers, care workers, diplomats, healthcare professionals, military personnel and transport workers.

## 'Unpersuasive.' 'Meritless.' 'Gross mischaracterization.' U.S. appeals court scorches CPS in case of 8-year-old's suicide

> I know this is a bit long, but this is the part about what that poor child had to go through:
> 
> > Gabriel was in the third grade at Carson when on Jan. 24, 2017, another student pushed him into a wall of a boys’ restroom, the blow knocking Gabriel unconscious for seven minutes. In a school video of the assault, the other student can be seen dancing over Gabriel.
> 
> > McKenzie found Gabriel and simply stood over him. School officials did not call 911 as CPS policy requires. The school nurse only told his mother that Gabriel fainted. Later that day, he complained of stomach pain and spent several hours at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. He stayed home from school Jan. 25, but on Jan. 26, two other students bullied Gabriel in a Carson restroom and stole his water bottle. He died after school that day in his bedroom of his mother's Westwood apartment.
> 
> > But bullying long had been a part of Gabriel’s life at Carson, as the Dec. 29 appeals court decision outlines. In first grade, he was injured on the playground in what officials called an accident, but his two front teeth had to be removed. In second grade, students hit Gabriel in two instances but were never punished. Gabriel’s parents say the school never called them.
> 
> > Three times in October 2016, three months before Gabriel died, students punched or hit him, and once when he hit back, school leaders warned he’d be punished if he defended himself again. On Halloween, Gabriel suffered a head injury, but Jackson and McKenzie told his mother they could not determine how it happened. They refused her request to look at video footage of the playground.
> 
> > Earlier in January 2017, Gabriel was attacked and injured three other times. McKenzie told Gabriel’s mother that no video captured the incidents, and Gabriel’s injuries amounted to “horseplay.” McKenzie did not tell Gabriel’s mother that he had suspended two students for attacking Gabriel.
> 
> And these are just the incidents that we know of, so there may have been many more. Especially a lot more that did not involve violence. And he was only 8 years old! Just 8 years old!
> 
> > “This court finds their behavior, as alleged, to be egregious and clearly reckless, thus barring them from the shield of government immunity,” wrote Judge Bernice Bouie Donald in the ruling.

## K-9 removed from home of Vacaville police officer filmed punching it

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/K-9-removed-from-home-of-Vacaville-police-officer-15842781.php):

> The K-9 filmed being punched by its handler has been removed from the officer's home and "Placed in the care of a third party," the Vacaville Police Department said. Last week, Vacaville police launched an investigation one of their own after video surfaced on Facebook of an officer punching his K-9 partner during a training exercise. "I heard a dog crying, when I looked, the officer was punching the dog over and over and got shocked about it," Palomino wrote.
