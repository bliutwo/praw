## Dollar Tree, Family Dollar to require masks for customers, associates

Summary of [original article](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/dollar-tree-family-dollar-to-require-masks-for-customers-associates/):

> DETROIT, Mich. - Last week, a Delta Airlines flight was forced to return to the gate in Detroit when two of their customers wouldn't wear masks. In a statement provided to NPR, Delta wrote: "Medical research tells us that wearing a mask is one of the most effective ways to reduce the COVID-19 infection rate." The airline "Remains committed to requiring customers and employees to wear a mask or face covering as a consistent layer of protection across all Delta touchpoints." As for exceptions to the mask rule, Delta's procedure involves a "Virtual consultation process facilitated by a Delta agent with a third-party medical professional [and] could take up to an hour." The airline generally encourages customers with underlying conditions that preclude mask-wearing to "Reconsider travel altogether."

> The Dollar General near me started 'requiring' them a few weeks ago. Not only do the staff not really wear the masks themselves (most of the time they are hanging around the neck) they don't do crap to enforce it on the customers either. Now my state has a mask order and its not being enforced at any place I've been since.
