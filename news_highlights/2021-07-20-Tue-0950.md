> If you read the article, this is just another 90 day renewal of the public health emergency. And declaring the emergency is necessary in order for the vaccines to be available on an emergency use authorization - otherwise we'd have to wait for full FDA approval. Plus the White House was open about the fact that they would renew it.

## Apple delays return to office as Covid cases rise

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57891289):

> In June, chief executive Tim Cook sent a company-wide memo telling workers they would have to return to their desks. Some Apple employees disagreed and in an internal letter said the plans made workers "Choose between either a combination of our families, our wellbeing, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple". Google has already issued similar instructions to staff, telling them to return to work three days a week by September.
