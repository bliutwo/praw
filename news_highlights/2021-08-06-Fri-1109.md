## Fort Bragg ready for expected mandate that all troops be vaccinated against coronavirus

Summary of [original article](https://wr.al/1L7rA):

> Fort Bragg, N.C. - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to order Friday that all active-duty U.S. military personnel be vaccinated against coronavirus, and Fort Bragg officials say the move is vital to the famed readiness of the 82nd Airborne Division. Between 60 and 80 percent of Fort Bragg troops are already vaccinated through voluntary clinics held at Womack Army Medical Center in recent months, officials said. The expected move by Austin, a former 82nd Airborne paratrooper and battalion commander and commander of Fort Bragg and the XVIII Airborne Corps, comes days after President Joe Biden urged all federal employees to get vaccinated.

`/u/grokm3` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/oz3my2/fort_bragg_ready_for_expected_mandate_that_all/):

> The fact that anyone in the military can say no to a vaccine is crazy. We all got all the shots in Bootcamp and then other shots when we got deployed to places where we would need shots. I can’t imagine a world in the Navy where I would say no to the chain of command.

> 
> > Opponents of lifting the ban who testified before the Legislature repeatedly cited false and discredited claims about the virus, including a woman who falsely suggested COVID-19 doesn’t exist.
> 
> > “You try to talk to someone about this, but there’s so much misinformation that’s out there you have to try to dispel that and then they’ll go to another one and do that and you’ve got to do that all the way down to keep them from getting upset at you before you can ever talk to them about it,” Republican Senate President Jimmy Hickey said.

> 
> Absolutely amazing.
> 
> > Hutchinson said this week he regretted signing the mask mandate ban, telling reporters that “in hindsight, I wish that had not become law.” Hutchinson noted he did so when the state’s cases were much lower and that the Legislature could have easily overridden him had he vetoed the measure.

> 
> There it is. He didnt sign it for easy political points. He signed it cause his veto would be overruled anyway. Great political work there. It's also my understanding this guy is at his term limit anyway. So it wouldn't have mattered if he vetoed it and got beat up for it.
> 
> 
> > The Republican sponsor of the mandate ban said he thinks the state needs to focus on other ways to address outbreaks in schools, such as leave for teachers who have to quarantine. “What I don’t want is this false sense of security that masks seem to be providing because it’s an easy political tool,” said Republican Sen. Trent Garner. “Let’s come up with the real solutions when this happens in our schools, and I think we’re woefully inadequate on that.”
> 
> 
> False sense of security with masks. So the appropriate alternative is no masks at all while having classrooms full of children. This is like saying lifeboats are a false sense of security so you might as well not have any on ships. This is some certified grade A stupid.

## Firefox has lost 46M users over the last three years

Summary of [original article](https://www.pcgamer.com/firefox-has-lost-46m-users-over-the-last-three-years/):

> A Reddit thread by u/nixcraft noticed a downward trend from Firefox's own Public Data Report that shows nearly 46 million users ditching Firefox over the last three years for a different internet browser. At the end of 2018, the reported active monthly users of the Firefox desktop client were about 244 million, but in Q2 2021 that number dropped to 198 million users. Why the drop-off? Firefox users have often complained about the lack of substantial performance updates in the last few years, along with the divisive Firefox 89 UI overhaul that convinced some long-time users to try their luck with other browsers.

`/u/DeepReally` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/oz1pqg/firefox_has_lost_46m_users_over_the_last_three/):

> > Mozilla launched Firefox back in 2002 as a more user-friendly alternative to Chromium-based browsers that focused on privacy and security
> 
> WTF PC Gamer!!!?  (Chromium browsers didn't exist until 2008)

## Target to offer debt-free college degrees to 340,000 US employees

Summary of [original article](https://abc7news.com/target-college-tuition-reimbursement-paying-for-program/10931655/):

> Like a slew of other big corporate names like Walmart, Taco Bell and the Walt Disney Co., Target is teaming up with Guild Education, a Denver startup that negotiates deals between companies and colleges for the program. Target says it's offering one of the most comprehensive programs. Target's move follows an announcement last month by Walmart that it will cover the full cost of tuition and books for its 1.5 million part-time and full-time Walmart and Sam's Club workers in the U.S. through its Live Better U program.

> I think this is how healthcare got bundled to employment. During WWII there was a wage freeze and to compete for workers companies offered insurance. Now they are bundling education to work during another crisis.

## Florida officials sue over wastewater dumped into Tampa Bay

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/business-environment-and-nature-tampa-florida-wastewater-8e40569824309eaf88a8d676729507c9):

> Florida Department of Environmental Protection interim Secretary Shawn Hamilton said in a statement Thursday that the lawsuit filed in Manatee County Circuit Court against HRK Holdings is a pivotal step to ensure the final chapter for the Piney Point site. The state is also seeking to recoup money that it spent on the site. Fearing a reservoir could collapse and spill into surrounding neighborhoods, state officials allowed HRK Holdings to pump the contaminated water into Tampa Bay to relieve pressure.

`/u/HerPaintedMan` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/oz8guh/florida_officials_sue_over_wastewater_dumped_into/):

> “The telephone listing for HRK Holdings was out of service “. 
> 
> This is about all you need to know about this corporate entity. Gone like a thief in the night. 
> 
> Another textbook case of the corporate pillage and run operations model.
