> >asks the court to limit photos of Arbery to just one in the trial, and that he appear by himself. It also requests that a non-related witness identify Arbery in the photograph, instead of a relative, "to avoid creating cumulative prejudicial error in the trial of this case."
> 
> What the fuck kind of attempt at a kangaroo court is this? 
> 
> >ask the court to order the prosecution to turn over all records relating to "Arbery's disciplinary, criminal, and mental health records" and the contents of his telephone records and social media accounts, and exclude from evidence all recorded jail calls made by the McMichaels while they were held in the Glynn County Detention Center.
> 
> The classic smear the victim using any means necessary. I'm sure Arbery was late to class once in 6th grade and that somehow justifies this lynching to these racist fucks. So telling that they want to jail calls excluded also...

> Los Angeles County reported 138 more COVID-19 deaths and another 15,701 new cases Saturday, as the county surpassed the 800,000-case mark. The number of coronavirus patients in county hospitals rose to 7,627 people, and 21% of them are in the ICU. Conditions continue to worsen at hospitals in the county, with ambulances waiting up to eight hours to off-load patients, leading to a shortage of paramedic crews on the streets and longer 911 response times. Chidester said there are reports of hospitals being so overwhelmed that ambulances are waiting seven or eight hours in emergency bays, forcing patients to be treated in the ambulance.
