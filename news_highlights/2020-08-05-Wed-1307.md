> CHICAGO - Chicago's mayor on Wednesday announced that the nation's third-largest school district will not welcome students back to the classroom, after all, and will instead rely only on remote instruction to start the school year.

School officials said it wouldn't be safe for students to do so while the coronavirus continues to spread.New York City has announced a plan to do hybrid instruction, where students would be in school buildings in small groups on some days of the week but would learn remotely from home on other days.
