> It's nice he got rewarded but the coverage shouldn't focus on this individual feel-good story, it should focus on the fact that the government has so totally abdicated its responsibilities that we're reliant on the unprompted charity of random citizens to paper over the cracks.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/us-sells-more-than-175-billion-in-weapons-to-foreign-governments.html):

> WASHINGTON - The U.S. sold $175 billion in weapons to foreign governments in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Pentagon and State Department officials announced Friday. Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments in the prior fiscal year totaled $170 billion. According to the latest figures released by State and Defense officials, the sale of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet to Japan amounted to $23.11 billion, leading America's weapons exports.

`/u/notagoodboye` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k7851u/us_sells_more_than_175_billion_in_weapons_to/):

> Weapons have always been one of our largest exports. Even as far back as WWI, when we barely had a military, we still sold a shitload of arms.
> 
> The real problem with that now, is how much the government funds the research. We pay for all the research, which the arms manufacturers then sell at a profit.

## Oregon doctor’s license revoked over refusal to wear mask during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-doctor-s-license-revoked-over-refusal-wear-mask-during-n1250092):

> The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a "Common cold." The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.

`/u/smooshmonkey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k742k9/oregon_doctors_license_revoked_over_refusal_to/):

> Yeah but it's not just him refusing to wear masks. He urged his patients to stop wearing them and apparently told his patients that being around other people helped to build their immunity. Title is a bit misleading.
