## Scores of worker Covid deaths not reported amid US regulator's lenient approach | US news

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/27/us-regulator-osha-covid-deaths-workers):

> Workplace safety regulators have taken a lenient stance toward employers during the pandemic, giving them broad discretion to decide internally whether to report worker deaths. KHN examined more than 240 deaths of healthcare workers profiled for the Lost on the Frontline project and found that employers did not report more than one-third of them to a state or federal Osha office, many based on internal decisions that the deaths were not work-related - conclusions that were not independently reviewed. Nursing homes, which are under strict Medicare requirements, reported more than 1,000 staff deaths through mid-October, but only about 350 deaths of long-term care facility workers appear to have been reported to Osha, agency records show.

> In most places where they're actually giving breakdowns of transmission sources, we see that workplaces and schools together make up the majority of cases.
> 
> Governments all over the place are bending over backwards to deny or hide this fact.  They want everyone to think the covid surge is purely because of irresponsible people going to their friends' houses.

`/u/ChiGuy6124` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k1s4ti/venezuela_judge_convicts_6_american_oil_execs/):

> **"A Venezuelan judge has found six American oil executives guilty of corruption charges and immediately sentenced them to prison"**
> 
> "Five of the men were sentenced to prison terms of 8 years and 10 months, while one of them received a 13-year sentence "
> 
> "Vadell, 61, and five other Citgo executives were summoned to the headquarters of the Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA, the parent company of the Houston-based Citgo, for what they had been told was a budget meeting on Nov. 21, 2017. A corporate jet shuttled them to Caracas and they were told they'd be home for Thanksgiving."
> 
> "Instead, a cadre of military intelligence officers swarmed the boardroom, taking them to jail."
> 
> "They’re charged with embezzlement stemming from a never-executed proposal to refinance some $4 billion in Citgo bonds by offering a 50% stake in the company as collateral. Maduro at the time accused them of “treason.” They all plead innocence."
> 
> "The trial has played out one day a week in a downtown Caracas court. Due to the pandemic, sessions are held in front of a bank of dormant elevators in a hallway, apparently to take advantage of air flowing through open windows."
> 
>  "Their trial started four months ago and closing arguments took place Thursday. The judge immediately announced her verdict. "
> 
> "News media and rights groups have been denied access to the hearings. There was no response to a letter addressed to Judge Lorena Cornielles seeking permission for The Associated Press to observe."
