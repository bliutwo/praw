Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/coronavirus/couple-ages-100-and-98-released-from-hospitals-ahead-of-73rd-anniversary-after-covid-19/2497877/):

> A Maryland couple looking forward to their 73rd anniversary are at a rehabilitation center for physical therapy after spending three weeks in separate hospitals with COVID-19. "It's a miracle that they survived," Mark Levin said about his parents, 100-year-old Betty and 98-year-old Joe Levin. "Two separate hospitals because they couldn't be together," Mark Levin said.

## Oregon doctor’s license revoked over refusal to wear mask during pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-doctor-s-license-revoked-over-refusal-wear-mask-during-n1250092):

> The medical license of an Oregon doctor who refused to wear a face mask despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been revoked weeks after a video surfaced of him dismissing Covid-19 as a "Common cold." The medical board also found that LaTulippe and his staff refused to wear masks in the clinic and urged patients to remove their own masks. While the physician has refused to wear a facial covering, LaTulippe previously said he asked patients who believe they have Covid-19 or are showing symptoms of the virus to wear one.

`/u/smooshmonkey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/k742k9/oregon_doctors_license_revoked_over_refusal_to/):

> Yeah but it's not just him refusing to wear masks. He urged his patients to stop wearing them and apparently told his patients that being around other people helped to build their immunity. Title is a bit misleading.

## U.S. sells more than $175 billion in weapons to foreign governments, nearly 3% higher than last year

> Weapons have always been one of our largest exports. Even as far back as WWI, when we barely had a military, we still sold a shitload of arms.
> 
> The real problem with that now, is how much the government funds the research. We pay for all the research, which the arms manufacturers then sell at a profit.

Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the "rich" can afford fossil fuel in the first place.

> § The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with "high confidence" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

## Jupiter and Saturn will come within 0.1 degrees of each other, forming the first visible "double planet" in 800 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jupiter-saturn-double-planet-great-conjunction-december-21/):

> Before 2020 comes to a close, Jupiter and Saturn will be so close that they will appear to form a "Double planet." The great conjunction, as the planetary alignment has come to be known, hasn't occurred in nearly 800 years. This occurs because Jupiter orbits the sun every 12 years, while Saturn's orbit takes 30 years - every couple of decades, Saturn is lapped by Jupiter, according to NASA. However, 2020's conjunction is especially rare - the planets haven't been observed this close together since medieval times, in 1226. The word "Conjunction" is used by astronomers to describe the meeting of objects in our night sky, and the great conjunction occurs between the two largest planets in our solar system: Jupiter and Saturn.

> Both will be visible in the eyepiece of a telescope.  Both look pretty cool alone, so together it will make for some great photos.
