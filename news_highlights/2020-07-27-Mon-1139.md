## Target joins Walmart in staying closed for Thanksgiving this year

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/target-joins-walmart-in-staying-closed-for-thanksgiving-this-year.html):

> Instead, Target is encouraging shoppers to start their holiday shopping even earlier, in October. Adding to the uncertainty, Amazon has delayed its annual Prime Day shopping event, which is normally in July, to "Later than usual" this year. The delayed timing of Amazon's Prime Day will likely put additional pressure on retailers to start their deals even earlier, in a bid to compete.

## 'Wall of Moms' movement extends to the Bay Area

Summary of [original article](https://www.ktvu.com/news/wall-of-moms-movement-extends-to-the-bay-area):

> OAKLAND, Calif. - More than a thousand people gathered in downtown Oakland on Saturday in solidarity with protesters in Portland. Wearing bright yellow shirts and carrying peace signs, the Bay Area "Wall of Moms" took to Oakland's Frank Ogawa plaza to continue protests for Black Lives Matter. "It's really great to see mom's standup with the protestors in solidarity and protect the protestors," said protestor, Raven Malone.

`/u/fibonaccicolours` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hyscjk/wall_of_moms_movement_extends_to_the_bay_area/):

> Friendly reminder to everyone that this makes news because it's white moms protesting; black moms have been there all along. I think it's a great thing to have more people joining the protests, and I think the wall of moms is great, but we need to recognize the eternal love that black moms have poured into this movement with much less press coverage.

## Portland prepares for 60th night of protests after police declare riot, use force the night prior

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/07/portland-prepares-for-60th-night-of-protests-after-police-declare-riot-use-force-the-night-prior.html):

> A crowd of about 1,000 gathered in downtown Portland late Sunday for the city's 60th night of consecutive protests against racism and police brutality after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd sparked a widespread movement two months ago. What started as a relatively calm night devolved as people in the crowd launched fireworks toward the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse and federal officers responded with gas and crowd-control munitions. Protesters toppled the fence in front of the courthouse earlier in the night after federal officers issued warnings about tampering with the fence.

`/u/thegeiber` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/hyhuyk/portland_prepares_for_60th_night_of_protests/):

> It’s a shame that all of this still goes on and instead of doing something about it, our elected politicians don’t do shit. We’re on day 60 for a reason. Do your jobs and acknowledge the problem.

About 100 protesters gathered at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles Saturday evening, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a release.
