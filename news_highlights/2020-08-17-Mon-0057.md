> Your daily reminder that the man currently gutting the USPS and his wife have between **$30.1 million and $75.3 million** in assets in U.S. Postal Service competitors and contractors. How the fuck such conflict of interest and corruption is allowed I don't know. Most crooked administration in history.

"It could be that he's planning on selling it, but I don't understand the delay. He has managed to divest a lot of other things. **And if he wasn't prepared to sell that off, he shouldn't have taken the job."**

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-high-school-student-knowingly-went-class-coronavirus-officials-say-n1236895):

> School officials in Oklahoma say a student knowingly attended classes with the coronavirus on the first day of school, thinking it was safe to do so because he was asymptotic. The student at Westmoore High School in Moore, just south of Oklahoma City, was "Under the understanding that since they were asymptomatic ... they did not need to quarantine for the full 14-day-period," school officials told NBC affiliate KFOR on Friday. The student was identified following an anonymous tip on Thursday, the first day of classes for the school, according to KFOR. The parents of the child told the school they had "Miscalculated" the end of their child's quarantine and thought it was safe to send him to school.

Alisha Morris, who teaches theater in Kansas' Olathe School District, was scouring the internet for news reports about COVID-19 issues surrounding K-12 school re-openings across the country when she became overwhelmed with information. Morris said she discovered more than 2,000 students, faculty, administrators and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide since the beginning of last month, with the cases being traced to myriad events including in-person schooling, staff meetings, extracurricular activities, summer camps, extended school year programs, graduation ceremonies and others.

## 8 Years After Proving Racism Affected His Trial, North Carolina Inmate Taken Off Death Row

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5879680/north-carolina-death-penalty-racial-justice-act-racism/):

> On Friday, the North Carolina Supreme Court reinstated the life sentence of Marcus Robinson, a 47-year-old Black man who proved before a judge in 2012 that racism had affected trial proceedings that resulted in his death sentence. Three other death row inmates-Tilmon Golphin, Christina Walters and Quintel Augustine-had also been re-sentenced to life under the RJA in 2012 but were then sent back to death row after a judge threw out their case in 2017. In June, the state Supreme Court issued a sweeping ruling that the RJA's repeal cannot be applied retroactively, meaning that everyone who filed a RJA claim before the Act was repealed - meaning over 100 death row inmates - has a right to a hearing to prove racism affected their sentences.
