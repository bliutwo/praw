## I had to call police after Tucker Carlson targeted me on air, photojournalist says

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/18/tucker-carlson-tristan-spinski-new-york-times-journalist):

> A photojournalist said he hid in fear in his own home, locking himself in an upstairs room with his family, after people tried to break in when he was named on air by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Carlson told his audience of millions the newspaper was working on a story "About where my family and I live". Despite this, Carlson told viewers: "So how would Murray Carpenter and his photographer, Tristan Spinski, feel if we told you where they live? If we put pictures of their homes on the air?".

`/u/AudibleNod` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/ic9p4n/i_had_to_call_police_after_tucker_carlson/):

> Remember, Fox News stated in a slander lawsuit that Tucker Carlson doesn't have an obligation to investigate the truth of statements before making them. They're basically admitting that they give him carte blanche to say anything that enters into his head with zero consequences.

## Federal judge in Oregon upholds record $925 million damages verdict in unlawful recorded robocall case

Summary of [original article](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2020/08/federal-judge-in-oregon-upholds-record-925-million-damages-verdict-in-unlawful-recorded-robocall-case.html):

> A federal judge has upheld a record $925 million in damages awarded in a class-action case against a Michigan-based marketing company that a jury in Portland found had engaged in unlawful telemarketing. "ViSalus's understanding of the limitations on damages imposed by due process implies that a constitutional penalty for a single violation becomes unconstitutional if the defendant commits the violation enough times," the judge wrote. Jonas Jacobson, Wakefield's attorney, said he hopes the ruling upholding the jury verdict - the largest damages award in a telephone consumer protection case - will "Make other robocallers think twice."
