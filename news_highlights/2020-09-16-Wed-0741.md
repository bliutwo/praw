## Exclusive: Georgia doctor who forcibly sterilized detained women has been identified

Summary of [original article](https://www.prismreports.org/article/2020/9/15/exclusive-georgia-doctor-who-forcibly-sterilized-detained-women-has-been-identified):

> According to the complaint, it appears as if detention center officials transfer women to an outside gynecologist, now believed to be Amin, and that detained women told Project South they do not trust the doctor. J. Marion Sims, the 19th-century doctor considered the "Father of gynecology," experimented on enslaved women. The American doctors behind the birth control pill first tested the medication on low-income Puerto Rican women, forcing them to become "Unwitting guinea pigs." As another example, nationwide eugenics campaigns targeted wide swaths of people for sterilization because they were considered "Undesirable." These campaigns first began in the early 1900s and targeted disabled people, poor people, and African Americans.

## Bill Gates Father, William H. Gates Sr., dies at age 94

Summary of [original article](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Remembering-Bill-Gates-Sr?WT.mc_id=20200915000000_Remembering-Bill-Gates-Sr_BG-TW_&WT.tsrc=BGTW):

> The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would not be what it is today without my dad. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the foundation. People who came through the doors of the Gates Foundation felt honored to work with my dad. He saw the best in everyone and made everyone feel special. Finally, my dad had a profoundly positive influence on my most important roles-husband and father.

`/u/toan55` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/itizfv/bill_gates_father_william_h_gates_sr_dies_at_age/):

> *My dad’s influence on our philanthropy was just as big. Throughout my childhood, he and my mom taught me by example what generosity looked like in how they used their time and resources. One night in the 1990s, before we started our foundation, Melinda, Dad, and I were standing in line at the movies. Melinda and I were talking about how we had been getting more requests for donations in the mail. Dad simply said, “Maybe I can help.”*

> *The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would not be what it is today without my dad. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the foundation. He was collaborative, judicious, and serious about learning. He was dignified but hated anything that seemed pretentious. (Dad’s given name was William H. Gates II, but he never used the “II”—he thought it sounded stuffy.) He was great at stepping back and seeing the big picture. He was quick to tear up when he saw people suffering in the world. And he would not let any of us forget the people behind the strategies we were discussing.*

## Chinese database details 2.4 million influential people, their kids, addresses, and how to press their buttons

Summary of [original article](https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/15/china_shenzhen_zhenhua_database/):

> The researcher alleges the purpose of the database is enabling influence operations to be conducted against prominent and influential people outside China. "In a second post Balding said the database matters because"what cannot be underestimated is the breadth and depth of the Chinese surveillance state and its extension around the world. "Open liberal democratic states can no longer pretend these threats do not exist. Today's database is compiled primarily from open sources, other databases China holds present much greater risks to Chinese and foreign citizens." .

## H&M cuts ties with Chinese supplier over accusations of 'forced labour'

Summary of [original article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/h-m-cuts-ties-with-chinese-supplier-over-accusations-of-forced-13115222):

> STOCKHOLM: Swedish clothing giant H&M said Tuesday it was ending its relationship with a Chinese yarn producer over accusations of "Forced labour" involving ethnic and religious minorities from China's Xinjiang province. "While there are no indications for forced labour in the Shangyu mill, we have decided to, until we get more clarity around allegations of forced labour, phase out our indirect business relationship with Huafu Fashion Co, regardless of unit and province, within the next 12 months." On Monday US customs said it would bar a raft of Chinese products including cotton, garments and hair products, from Xinjiang over fears they were made using forced labour.
