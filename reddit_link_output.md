> Angela Merkel has said that Britain will have to "Live with the consequences" of Boris Johnson's decision to ditch Theresa May's plans for close alignment with the European Union after Brexit. A separate survey by pollsters Ipsos Mori found a majority think it is "Likely" the UK will leave the EU on 31 December without a trade deal, compared to just 30 per cent who think Mr Johnson will get a deal by the deadline - and 25 per cent who think he can get a deal which is good for Britain. "Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos Mori, said:"The public are generally pessimistic at the prospect of a good trade deal for Britain being struck with the EU before the transition period ends and the clear expectation is that the UK will exit the transition period without a deal being struck at all.
