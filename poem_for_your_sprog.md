When I'm tapping my potential -  
When I'm scrubbing up to rub -  
When I'm sapping the essential  
From the purple-headed club -  

When I'm cooking up a lonesome -  
When I take the solo stand -  
When I'm playing on my ownsome,  
And the tossing time's at hand -

When I spring the knuckle shuffle -  
When I start the old one-two -  
When I make the flagpole ruffle,  
And I milk the morning dew -   

When I burn the pearly candle -  
When I flog the throbbing log -  
When I pump the salty handle,  
Squeeze the smoke-stack of its smog -

When I spank the chunky monkey -  
When I give the snake a stroke -  
When I turn the skin-flute funky,  
And I whip the beaten yolk -

When I do it,  
get down to it,  
Get on through it,  
getting me -  
When I court the cock and woo it -  

Then I do it where I pee.

If money is fleeting, and speedily spent -  
Depleting completely by dollar and cent -  
Diminishing, draining, and quick to depart -  
Consider a few little changes to start:

It's simple advice, but it's prudent, no doubt -  
Prepare your own food and avoid eating out!  
That sandwich and cookie and coffee with foam -  
It's endlessly cheaper to make it at home!

Reduce, if you're smoking, or bid them goodbye!  
Go make yourself handy and learn DIY!  
Whenever you're shopping, whatever you do -  
Just ask: *"do I need this?"* and answer it true!

Consider a budget, or system to save -  
It's easy to yield to the stuff that you crave!  
Account for your cash, and the life that you lead -  
Make lists when you're shopping and get what you need!

Remember: it's not about crafting a ploy  
To drop or deny all the things you enjoy -  
To linger, surviving on ramen and beans -  
It's just about living inside of your means.

And if you still struggle and grapple and doubt -  
You try and you work but you can't work it out -  
You endlessly battle to balance your worth -  

Then wait for a virus to fuck up the Earth.

You're a wholesome honeybee!  
You're the spirit of devotion,

When Little Timmy's wife declined  
His silver ring and gem -  
"I want a *change*," his wife opined,  
"I want *BDSM*."

So Little Timmy bought a whip,  
A leather suit and chains -  
A ball and gag, a nipple clip  
For naughty bedroom pains.  

He wore the suit -  
he locked the door,  
And donned the cuffs with pride.  

But Timmy's wife meant something *more*.

"The Nurse"

Her arms are stiff.  
Her legs are sore.  
She wakes and washes, eats.  
She walks downstairs  
then out the door,  
And on to empty streets.  

She heard the news at dawn, aghast.  
The reader cried to say:  
A hundred more on Friday last.  

Two hundred more today.  

The hall goes on ahead for miles.  
She opens doors with doubt.  
And stops to see there's some with smiles -  
And others there without.  

She turns her hands to one and then -  
She turns to all the rest.  
And some she helps to rise again,  
And some she tries her best.  

But this man's lungs gave all they've got -  
A life too young to lose.  
Another face to her that's not  
A number in the news.  

Her arms are stiff.  
Her legs are sore.  
She changes charts and sheets.  
She cleans her hands,  
then out the door,  
And back on empty streets.

And so it goes -  
but that's her task.  
She works without a fuss.

"Whatever for?" I hear you ask.

Whatever for?

When God was enjoying a wonderful day -  
He coloured the ocean, the sea and the spray.  
He peppered the planet with forests of trees -  
With sweet subtle scents on a warm summer's breeze.   

He crafted the kitten, and when he was done -  
Perfected the pup and the penguin for fun.  
He playfully reached in the depths of his mind -  
And found all the finest of Animal Kind.

"A toast," he exclaimed, "to the things that I've made!  
The creatures I've crafted, the plans that I've laid!"  
And so with fulfilment, content to his core,  
He knocked back a whiskey... and poured himself more.

The following morning he woke in a daze.  
He woke with a head full of headache and haze.  
He woke with a groan and a moan of distress.  
He woke and he rose, and his place was a *mess.*

The whiskey was empty.  
The cupboards were bare.  
He'd drank till the dawn of the morn in his chair.  
And when all his liquors had passed by his lip -  
He'd conjured a spirit for spirits to sip.

"Good Heavens," he whispered, "oh boy, what a night -  
At least nothing happened," he said with delight.  
He walked to his workshop.  
He went for his key.  
He stared with dismay, and he said "oh my *me*."

His organised boxes of animal parts -  
The toes and the noses, the lungs and the hearts -  
He'd spilled them; he'd mixed them and filled them and split.   

He'd opened the box that said *Horrible Shit.*

"Oh Jesus," said Jesus, from somewhere behind.  
"You've got to stop drinking each time you've designed!"  
But God heard the buzzing.

He clenched a fist,  
While poking each and every cyst  
That swelled and bulged and burst to leak  
Between each decomposing cheek  
And parasite-infested ass  
In potent clouds of methane gas.

"My god!" he said, "what have you done?  
Where have you been, my wayward son?  
What rotten monster have you thought  
To share as one?" he cried, distraught -  
"There's not a pill across the Earth  
Could fix you now, for what it's worth!  
Forget the cure! It's clear to me  
I'd better call the CDC  
(And really pretty fucking quick)  
To quarantine your putrid dick!"  
He said and sat in seconds flat.  
"Where were you, buddy? Tell me that."  

He eyed my rat-infested cock.

>This is what I needed to hear right now. Thankyou for your story. I’m in a similar situation. A merry Xmas to you from a stranger!

'Twas midnight when the bells were rung,  
And all the Christmas songs were sung  
In sight of softly falling snow  
That dropped and drifted down below,  
Where people watched with hope and glee  
To spy the scene they'd dreamed to see -

The Christmas light;  
the town awoke,  
And through the clouds of chimney smoke,  
They looked above to see the sleigh  
That upped and rose and rolled away,  
And with a merry, laughing call,  
He cried: 'Goodnight, to one and all!"

They watched him go;  
they shared a smile;  
They warmed their hands, and for a while,  
There were no gripes;  
there were no grumps;  
There were no doubts or Donald Trumps;  
There were no fears;  
there were no ends -   
But only love, and only friends.

And so, to one, to all, and more,  
For all ahead, and all before,  
With festive fun,  
and winter rhyme -   

*A very merry Christmas time.*

It walks to your kitchen -

When Little Timmy went to bed,  
A *knock* came from his door:  
"Can I come in?" his father said,  
And crossed the bedroom floor.

"What is it, pa?" said Little Tim,  
Alarmed, afraid to know -  
His father's face was lined and grim,  
And set with grief and woe.  

"I'm sorry, son," he heard him say.  
He hung his head and sighed.  
"It's just... I have a *debt* to pay."

And Timmy fucking died.

'twas the night before Christmas,  
and all of the cops -  
Had gathered their footage,  
and pulled out the stops.  
They'd picked and they'd chosen,  
collected and massed -  
their footage of vandals  
the four seasons passed.

They gathered with partners  
in uniforms blue -   
with donuts and coffee  
and sergeants to view -  
with handguns and handcuffs  
and hearts filled with joy -  
and new shiny badges  
for each girl and boy.  

"Be silent, it's starting!"  
said one with a smile -  
and there, in the silence,  
they watched for a while.  
And who could resent them  
their pride and delight?  
For now,  
it was Christmas.  

To all, a good night.

A package, arrived by the dawn of the day.  
A brown paper packet, addressed with her name -  
But not with a sender, or whence it had came.

She opened it slowly.  
She gandered within.  
She frowned for a moment and scratched at her chin.  
She stood and she stared with a soft little sigh.  

She looked at the dicks,

When Little Timmy went to dine  
Beside a friend or two -  
He said: "perchance, it might be fine  
To feast with carved bamboo!  

"I like to take a wooden stick,  
A pair," he spoke with ease -  
"And point them both at food to pick  
And grab and snag and squeeze!

"Oh what delight it is," he said,  
"To grasp your grub between!  
To clasp the feed that waits ahead,  
The red, the white and green!"  

He hooked a noodle, long and limp -  
He raised his sticks with pride.

There I sat, procrastinating,  
Hope and hapless,  
bored and waiting,

Jerking in the gloom -

Up and down I moved it, eager,   
Hands an ardent ball beleaguer,  
Pulled upon my member meager,  
Gave my pubes a groom -  

Till I found my predilection  
Held no further more affection,  
Glumly feeling my erection  
Dwindle down to doom -

"Oh," I said and softly, sadly,  
Freed my flagging phallus gladly,   
Till my mother whispered, madly:

One wild and winsome day -  
He thought it might be rather cool  
To skip his class and play.

He ran around the schoolyard gate  
With whoops of jumping joy -

And caught the wayward boy.

They said and sadly sighed.

When rivers coursed their journey rough -  
I longed to wake and wait a while  
To see her sleep,  
and watch her smile.

We didn't care for what's outside -  
No wind-whipped world or raging tide,  
Nor pain or loss or duty, debt,  
Could bend or break our safety net.  

I dreamt to wake and rise each day  
Without a single word to say,  
But just a thought - a moment's bliss -    
To think that life was made for this.

And though it's hard to say farewell -  
To share our final tale to tell,  
And times are tough,  
and life is rough -

And things you always thought you knew,   
And when you do,  
You dream each night   
Of what could be, and what just might.  

But now you think inside your head  
That all those thoughts and words unsaid,  
And all you've always hoped to do -  
Perhaps they're just not made for you.

There lived a man inside a whale.  
He made his bed within the tail.  
He crouched around the shiny fins,  
And on the bones he banged his shins.  

There lived a man inside a whale.  
Concealed from rain and wind and hail.  
Away from storms and troubles rough,  
And other such unpleasant stuff.  

There lived a man inside a whale.  
Alas, he sadly had to bail.  
You see, my friend, the story goes,  
One day he simply said:

>"The Angry Meal"

"Does it come with a toy?"  
I had asked with a smile,  
And she answered with joy,  
As she grinned for a while:  
"Oh you'd better believe  
That you'll love what we'll pick!  
In the meal you'll receive  
Is a *punch to the dick.*  

"And instead of the fries,  
It's a *punch to the dick.*  
You'll enjoy the surprise,  
It's a *punch to the dick.*  
Take a sip from your drink,  
It's a *punch to the dick.*  
Is it good?  
No I think  
It's a *punch to the dick.*"

So I pondered the meal  
Through a moment or three,  
And I started to feel  
That it wasn't for me,  
But I thought *what the hell*,  
For at least it was quick,  
And I ordered,  
and well...

'twas a punch to the dick[.](https://imgur.com/r/highqualitygifs/i9Z4egW)

Tiny tarnished metal penny,  
Were you always waiting here?  
Have you been to places many?  
Have you travelled far and near?    

Were you traded in a market?  
Were you spent on something sweet?  
Or a car so they could park it  
By the meter in the street?

Were you left in someone's pocket  
On a rainy afternoon -  
Who was working on a rocket  
They were sending to the moon?  

Have you heard a thousand voices?  
Have you seen a thousand sights?  
Were you flipped for tricky choices?  
Were you dropped from dizzy heights?

Of a trip to shining stars -  
Of a journey through the darkness  
On a rocket-ship to Mars -  
Of a place above the heavens,  
Or beyond the tallest tree -  
Where tomorrow lasts forever,  
And the waves are waving free.

There are stories told in mumbles  
Of the deepest caverns cold -  
Of a tumble under wonders  
In the search for ancient gold -  
Of a trek towards a treasure,  
And a step on olden sands -  
Of a distance you can measure  
With your feet and with your hands.

There are stories made in murmurs  
And they're spoken soft and slow -  
Of a night descending gently,  
And a light that shines below -  
Of a love uncomplicated,  
And a promise made to keep -

When I'm feeling bored and lonely -  
When I'm down for something new -  
When I'm lost and really only  
At a loss for what to do -  

When I'm sick of dull and dreary -  
When I'm weary, all at sea -   
When I'm feeling tired and teary,  
Stuck with nowhere else to be -  

Then I make my own decision -  
Then I take the chance to go -  
Take a leap, and with precision,  
Jump in fucking hedges, yo.

Beneath this starry light.

'Twas late in the fifties, enacting a plan,  
When troubles were started, and problems began.  
The Communist Party of China would say:  
"Collectivisation's the word of the day!  

"We've had it with former proceedings," said Mao -  
"It's time for a leap to the here and the now!  
And if there's resistance," he thought to explain,  
"We'll purge with the fair anti-rightist campaign!

"Exclusive production is bad for the soul -  
And isn't it better to work as a whole?  
It's truly unruly, and duly, I feel -  
We're better investing in grain and in steel!  

"Let's shake-up and make-up a future, my friends -  
And when the adventure succeeds in its ends,  
We'll build a new China!' he said with a sigh.

For you might be sick of waiting...

One fair and fated day -

He chose it right away!  

He'd fixed his will and made his mind,

"How dreadful can it be?"  

And so he went to work with joy

The hardest lessons learned in life  
Are dealt and earned with grief -

Then I leave the drab and dreary,  
And I trade it for my home.

In the kitchen, at the table,  
I can build myself a smile -  
And I find that I am able  
To be happy for a while.  

See it's mine alone and only,  
Only where I long to be -  
And I'm never truly lonely  
When I'm on my own with me.

So it's simple in summation,  
For I really must admit -  
In my place of habitation...

I can freely take a shit.

It keeps him safe and warm until  
He floats beyond,  
he drifts, he dreams,  
And all is sure and sweet, it seems.

And underneath,  
the seconds cease.  
He is content.  
He is at peace.  
He wakes, he whispers,  
soft and slow:  

'... I love you, weighted blanket bro.'

Perhaps you will think I'm betraying your trust -  
Uncaring, unrightful, unfair and unjust.   
Perhaps you will think that I should have been true -  
Been open and artless,  
been honest with you.  

Perhaps you will think that I shouldn't have lied -  
Should simply accepted your wishes, or tried.  
Perhaps you will wish that I'd dallied or stalled -  
Perhaps you will wish that you'd never have called.  

But maybe, and hopefully, soon you will know -  
I could not, I would not, I can't let it go.

I will not regret it.  

I won't let it be.  

So never forget it.

You matter to me.

When your choices break and bore you,  
And your days are long and blue -  
'Cause they've all been chosen for you,  
But you never really knew -  

When you want to change tomorrow,  
But you're trapped inside today -  
And there's nothing but the sorrow,  
And it never goes away -  

When you're clearly and you're really  
In the same unchanging scene -  
Then you say it so sincerely -  

*It ain't easy being green.*

Once upon a classroom dreary, while he pondered lessons weary,  
Over many a quaint and curious textbook of forgotten lore -  
There he pondered, nearly napping, whereupon there came a tapping,  
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at the desk before -  
'Tis somebody else,' he muttered, 'tapping at the desk before -  
Only this and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly came the creaking, came the whining, came the squeaking,  
Came the sight of penis peeking just beyond that desk of yore -  
How it rose and grumbled, groaning, rasped and murmured, mumbled, moaning,  
Stretched and strained and hummed like droning tones and throbs of someone's snore -  
Deep, profound and ringing, rolling tones and throbs of someone's snore -  
Like a mighty lion's roar.

'Lord above,' he whispered gently, horrified and consequently,  
So perturbed and so intently troubled to his very core -  
That he rose to see it showing, stated as it grated, growing,  
'So I really must be going, going through this classroom door' -  
And 'tis said he still is going, gone beyond that classroom door -  
For they saw him - nevermore.

I know that I don't always see you enough -  
With work and with kids and a marriage, it's tough.  
You wake and you take it by dawn and by day -  
And noon turns to evening, and time slips away.

'We'll have to do something,' we said when we met -  
But you and me, brother, we tend to forget.  
We're working -  
We're busy -  
We both try our best -  
And life doesn't always leave room for the rest.  

But then, with a smile, I remember it's you.  
We say that we'll meet, and eventually do.  
You're there when I need you, and that doesn't end.  
So buddy, be seeing you...

maybe.

Your friend.

Some parents are bitter.  
Some parents are blue.  
And some are unbearable,  
terrible too.  
Some parents are thoughtless,  
And others unfair.  
And some are inconstant,  
And some never there.  

Some parents are vicious.  
Some parents are hard.  
And some leave you lonely,  
And some leave you scarred.  
Some parents are lazy,  
And others unkind.  
And some only wreck  
And corrupt what they find.

Some parents are awful -  
But others are not.  
They give and they give  
And they give what they've got.  
They hold you together.  
They show you what's true.  

We don't get to choose them.

I'm glad I had you.

She speaks the words he hates to hear.  
A constant voice inside his ear.  
A grudging sigh.  
A judging frown.

He slowly turns the volume down.
