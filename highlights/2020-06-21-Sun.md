> Same story. Over and over and over again.  Same results.  Should have shut down early and temporarily. Would have less losses both in lives and finances. Beginning to understand that American companies don't succeed because they're good at business but because of the generous corporate welfare the country provides.

## ‘They Just Dumped Him Like Trash’: Nursing Homes Evict Vulnerable Residents

Summary of [original article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/business/nursing-homes-evictions-discharges-coronavirus.html):

> According to three Lakeview employees, Mr. Kendrick's ouster came as the nursing home was telling staff members to try to clear out less-profitable residents to make room for a new class of customers who would generate more revenue: patients with Covid-19.More than any other institution in America, nursing homes have come to symbolize the deadly destruction of the coronavirus crisis. Nursing homes have long had a financial incentive to evict Medicaid patients in favor of those who pay through private insurance or Medicare, which reimburses nursing homes at a much higher rate than Medicaid. In March, seven groups that represent nursing home residents wrote to New York's health department, urging it to stop nursing homes from evicting residents because they are "Particularly vulnerable to the Covid-19 virus." Such discharges, especially to homeless shelters, they wrote, "Pose particular public health risks, due to the close living quarters in shelters." The letter also warned that sending patients from nursing homes - hotbeds of the coronavirus - into the community could hasten the spread of the disease.

> When my grandmother got sick. Alzheimer’s and dementia. She would randomly drive places and forget where she was. So we had to take the car away.  It was a death sentence for an older independent woman. We eventually had to put her in a home to give her the constant care she needed.  She was pushed down by an aggressive resident, hit her head and went into a coma. Never came out.  Of course the place completely lied and covered it up.  My mother only found out a year later when a friend that also had a relative there mentioned my grandmother was pushed down and hit her head.  Fuck all these scammy places.

## U.S. reports highest number of new coronavirus cases since May 1

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/us-coronavirus-cases-june-may-60e508ef-4101-42b7-bc0f-a9db02e2c68a.html):

> The U.S. on Saturday reported more than 33,000 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, the highest total since May 1, CNBC reports, citing Johns Hopkins data. Why it matters: It's a sign that the outbreak isn't slowing down nationwide, even as the number of new cases in original hotspots like New York continues to drop. Between the lines: President Trump claimed at a rally on Saturday that he told officials to slow down testing, blaming an increase in testing capacity for the growth in new cases.

> I'm sorry to say, but the United States has essentially given up.  States have adamantly said lockdowns are not occurring again and many won't even impose mask mandates.  Places like my native Pennsylvania have a mask mandate but convenience stores like Sheetz and other places like Lowe's are not enforcing them at all.
