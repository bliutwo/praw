They said that Tesla is failing to follow social distancing guidelines, with lax enforcement of rules concerning masks and sanitation of machinery. They also complain of little transparency by the company about new cases of infection, as well as its response[...]

## Coronavirus responses highlight how humans are hardwired to dismiss facts that don't fit their worldview

> As well-versed as he is in the science of the coronavirus, he's overlooking the well-established science of "Anti-science bias," or science denial. Science denial is notoriously resistant to facts because it isn't about facts in the first place. To successfully tackle them, we must not ignore what the science tells us about science denial.

> A little over a quarter of the ICU beds are taken by COVID-19 patents, and hospitals are convertuing regular rooms to critical care. Hospitals in Houston's Medical Center will now move some ICU patients to beds not normally used for critical care. Boom said there are plenty of beds at Houston Methodist and other hospitals that can be used as ICU beds if needed.

## Sweden didn’t impose a lockdown, but its economy is just as bad as its neighbors

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sweden-didnt-impose-a-lockdown-its-economy-is-just-as-bad-as-its-neighbors-who-did-2020-06-25?mod=home-page):

> Did Sweden benefit economically from avoiding the lockdown? Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment strategist at BCA Research, pitted Sweden against Denmark, noting they speak near-identical languages and share a broadly similar culture and demographic, yet Denmark imposed one of the most aggressive lockdowns globally. Passenger car registrations in Sweden fell 37% year-over-year in April and 49% in May. In Denmark, they fell 37% in April and 40% in May. Sweden's services industry confidence index in May of -46.9 was actually worse than the EU-wide -43.3 reading, and Denmark's -41.9.

## Analysis | New research explores how conservative media misinformation may have intensified the severity of the pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/fox-news-hannity-coronavirus-misinformation/):

> "We are receiving an incredible number of studies and solid data showing that consuming far-right media and social media content was strongly associated with low concern about the virus at the onset of the pandemic," said Irene Pasquetto, chief editor of the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, which published one of the studies. In April, Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and Dolores Albarracin of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign published a peer-reviewed study examining how Americans' media diets affected their beliefs about the coronavirus. The study focuses specifically on the differences in how Fox's Tucker Carlson and Hannity discussed the pandemic during its early days.

## White House ordered NIH to cancel coronavirus research funding, Fauci says

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/white-house-ordered-nih-to-cancel-coronavirus-research-funding-fauci-says/):

> The National Institutes of Health abruptly cut off funding to a long-standing, well-regarded research project on bat coronaviruses only after the White House specifically told it to do so, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci clarified to Politico that it was the White House that told the NIH to cancel the funding. An unnamed White House official told Politico that the White House did encourage the funding cut, but ultimately it was the Department of Health and Human Services-of which the NIH is a part-that made the final decision.
