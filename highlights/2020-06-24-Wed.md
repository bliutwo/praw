## 65% of Americans would rather return to lockdown if coronavirus cases spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-lockdown-again-poll-ea67ee85-0742-478a-8b1c-88d0f7a6076f.html):

> Governors may soon have tough decisions to make as coronavirus infections continue to increase in the U.S., and new data shows Americans are clearly in favor of shutting economies down again rather than risk infection. Driving the news: A new survey from data firm CivicScience of nearly 2,500 U.S. adults finds 65% of the general population over the age of 18 supports returning to lockdown if cases of COVID-19 rise significantly. Flashback: Public opinion is turning in states governed by Republicans and won by President Trump in 2016 that are seeing increased infection rates.

> Heres most peoples thoughts id say; no problem going back to a lockdown but what are you going to do for me financially? You need to provide people with relief, of course people would like to lockdown and avoid this virus, but some of us literally cannot take the financial hit

> We seriously just ctrl+c, ctrl+v history every ~100 years.   There had to be an initiative during the Spanish Flu to get people to wear masks. The emphasis was focused on wearing masks to protect our troops and those who didn't wear masks were framed as slackers. Without a World War happening, getting someone like Mattis to encourage us to work together is the best we've got.  Based on history, I am not looking forward to watching us all relearn (history should have already taught us this) the lessons that this coming Fall will teach us.

## Rubio: 'Everyone should just wear a damn mask'

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/504365-rubio-everyone-should-just-wear-a-damn-mask):

> Sen. said Wednesday that "Everyone" should be wearing a mask to prevent the transmission of the coronavirus as states across the country report troubling surges in confirmed cases and hospitalizations. "I would just encourage everyone - that's what I said in there - to sort of become informed of the nuances of how your state is reporting. In Florida, the state tells us 20 percent of the COVID cases that register as hospitalizations are people that are in the hospital for something else, like a knee replacement, but they're tested so they tested positive," he added. The spikes have led several cities, including Miami, to require residents to wear masks in public, but Gov. has said he will not mandate mask use throughout the Sunshine State.

> we absolutely *need* conservative voices to step up right now and urge their constituents to protect themselves and others. imagine what sort of behavior we'd be seeing from trump's supporters if he had taken a hard line on mask wearing and was sure to wear a mask whenever he was out in public; his followers would have been militant about wearing masks and seen it as a point of american pride.  rubio might suck in every other conceivable way, but what he's doing right now is reflective of the leadership we need.

## Face masks are now mandatory in public places in North Carolina

Summary of [original article](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/north-carolina-governor-roy-cooper-coronavirus-phase-mask/275-5403927e-871d-4fd8-94c9-6805a2a3a9da):

> "Wearing a face covering is an easy thing to do that can make a huge impact for all of us. A major spike in cases would be catastrophic to the system, and without your cooperation, nurses and our fellow healthcare providers will have a harder time caring for sick patients for weeks and months to come," said Dennis Taylor, a nurse, and President of the North Carolina Nurses Association. North Carolina will also continue the Safer at Home Phase 2 for another two weeks, until July 17. Based on the metrics laid out in April by Governor Cooper and Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Mandy Cohen, North Carolina is evaluating a combination of the data from the following categories that shows the indicators moving in the wrong direction.

## Houston ICUs at 97 Percent Capacity as Texas Coronavirus Cases Break Records

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/houston-icus-90-percent-capacity-texas-coronavirus-cases-break-records-1513077):

> Almost all intensive care unit beds at Houston hospitals were occupied on Wednesday as Texas reported a record number of statewide patient admissions related to the novel coronavirus. During a City Council meeting Wednesday morning, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said 97 percent of the city's ICU beds were filled. Houston's heightened ICU admissions were reported as cases and hospitalizations related to the coronavirus are spiking throughout Texas.

`/u/Canucker22` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hf5m2x/houston_icus_at_97_percent_capacity_as_texas/):

> So if I understand correctly, even though Texas is surging it has no strict lockdown measures in effect and a large portion of the population is either ignoring the pandemic or thinks it is a complete hoax.  Is this accurate?
