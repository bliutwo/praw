> SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla workers in California tested positive last month for the novel coronavirus following chief executive Elon Musk's defiant reopening of the company's main production facility in Fremont, according to employees with knowledge of the situation. As part of the agreement struck allowing Tesla to reopen on May 18, Tesla would have to report all positive cases to the Alameda County Public Health Department. Because Tesla restarted production a week earlier, there could have been cases that were never reported to the county because Tesla was "Not required to directly report known cases" before the agreement, county officials said.
