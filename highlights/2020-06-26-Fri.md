> A majority of Americans, 56%, conclude that the country's moving too quickly to reopen, while only 15% say it's moving too slowly and 29% believe the country is moving at about the right pace. Just over four in 10 say the country is moving at about the right pace, while 28% and 29% say the country is moving too quickly and too slowly, respectively. Non-white Americans are more likely than white Americans to be concerned about contracting the coronavirus, 85% as opposed to 71%, and believe that the country is moving too swiftly to reopen the economy, 69% as opposed to 48%. An earlier release from this ABC News/Ipsos survey on Thursday found that nearly nine in 10 Americans who left their home in the last week wore a face mask or a face covering, compared to only 11% who said they did not.

> The city of Miami will begin fining repeat offenders up to $500 for not wearing a mask in public, citing the surge in COVID-19 cases across the state of Florida. "With the number of COVID-19 cases in our community growing, every single Miamian must step up and do their part to reverse this surge by wearing face coverings whenever they're in public spaces," Noriega said. Though the wearing of masks has become a partisan issue in some locations - opposition largely driven by a misunderstanding of the science - Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican who tested positive for COVID-19 in early March, is a believer.

## Texas Closes all Bars. Reduces Restaurant Capacity.

Summary of [original article](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/26/texas-bars-restaurants-coronavirus-greg-abbott/):

> Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday took his most drastic action yet to respond to the post-reopening coronavirus surge in Texas, shutting bars back down and scaling back restaurant capacity to 50%. He also shut down river-rafting trips and banned outdoor gatherings of over 100 people unless local officials approve. "At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars," Abbott said in a news release. Abbott put Texas under what was effectively a stay-at-home order for most of April, shutting down all but businesses considered essential by the state.

## Florida governor under fire over claims state is 'cooking the books' on Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/26/florida-governor-ron-desantis-republican-coronavirus):

> Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis's faltering response to soaring new coronavirus numbers in his state is descending into acrimony, after an accusation his administration is "Cooking the books" in an effort to hide the true impact of the devastating pandemic. Rebekah Jones, who says she was fired from her job in charge of the state's official Covid-19 database in May for refusing to manipulate its figures, claimed on social media to have evidence that employees at Florida's department of health "Have been instructed this week to change the numbers and begin slowly deleting deaths and cases so it looks like Florida is improving next week in the lead-up to July 4, like they've 'made it over the hump'." A month after berating reporters whom he said "Waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York," that scenario has been realized, with New York joining New Jersey and Connecticut this week in ordering visitors from Florida - among other badly affected states - to quarantine.

> This is not a rehash of the similar accusations that were made a month or more ago.  This is a fresh, new act.
> 
> Florida has very strict public records laws.  Records in state computer databases are, public records.  Altering, falsifying or destroying public records, *is a felony in Florida*  [(Fla Statutes 839.13)](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/839.13).   This sure looks bad for the Governor.

## Hospital patients four times less likely to die now than they were in April, Oxford study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/25/oxford-university-analysis-coronavirus-death-rate-hospitals/):

> "Prof Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence Based Medicine, who carried out the analysis with Dr Jason Oke, of Oxford University, and Dr Jason Mahon of the University of York said:"The reasons for the declining death rate in hospitals may be a combination of one or all of these factors or due to some other reason, we have not considered. "In either case, further research is warranted to understand why the hospital death rate has declined so markedly over the past eight weeks." Of the 10, 387 people in hospital in England with Covid-19 on 2 April, 644 died, whereas on 15 June it was 50 out of 3,270, which shows that the death rate in April was four-fold higher than in June.

> This. This is what I was riding out. I am taking all precautions but even if I get unlucky and catch this thing, at least I won't die on a stretcher because they had no space or no ventilator left.
