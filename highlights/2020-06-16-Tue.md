> The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: "This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough." The antiviral drug remdesivir which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.

He should be on the national news talking to people. DJ Jazzy Jeff as well.   “I gotta change my entire diet,” Scarface said. “I gotta do dialysis four times a week, three hours a day. That’s taking all of my blood out, cleaning it, and putting it back in my body. Before the COVID, I never had kidney problems before.”
