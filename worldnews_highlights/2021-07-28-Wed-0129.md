## Bhutan fully vaccinates 90% of eligible adults within a week.

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-bhutan-596528eca3535b5c2ee79e275ec5e7e0):

> Health experts say Bhutan's small population helped, but the country also benefited from strong and effective messaging from top officials and an established cold chain storage system. Another crucial ingredient in the vaccine drive is the country's extensive network of citizen volunteers called "Desuups," said Will Parks, the UNICEF representative for Bhutan. Bhutan's success is an anomaly in South Asia where countries such as India and Bangladesh are struggling to ramp up their vaccination rates.

Summary of [original article](https://www.severe-weather.eu/europe-weather/most-intense-heatwave-summer-2021-forecast-mk/?fbclid=IwAR2ciCsO6vDaNMdVnvclr1JSMh91wmoZwD55gUVi7eNjPcshLDeBl92fI00):

> Peak temperatures are expected to push well above 40 °C, potentially even close to around 45 °C in parts of the southern Balkan peninsula, as well as Italy and other parts of the south-central Mediterranean. The attached chart below is showing the maximum temperatures observed across the central and southern parts of Europe early this week, on Monday, July 26th. The Mid to upper 30s were reported from Italy and the southern Balkan peninsula. This is undoubtedly leading to extremely high daytime maximum temperatures, close to mid-40s. While the right chart for Lecce, Italy hints that the heat will remain as hot as it is in these days, also peaking around Aug 2nd. Temperatures are about 7-8 °C warmer than normal at 1500 m ASL. EXTREME HEATWAVE EXTENDS INTO EARLY AUGUST, REFRESHMENT TO THE NORTH. Although parts of the Mediterranean and the Balkan peninsula might see the peak of the ongoing heatwave on Friday into Saturday, the scorching heat will remain over far southern parts of the peninsula also through the early days of August.

## Bermuda wins its first-ever Olympic gold after nearly 100 years of trying

Summary of [original article](https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020/en/news/bermuda-s-flora-duffy-wins-gold-in-women-s-triathlon-race-of-champions):

> Bermuda's Flora Duffy dominated the run portion of the women's triathlon to win Olympic gold on a wet and humid morning at Odaiba Marine Park. Britain's Taylor-Brown, who was crowned 2020 world champion after a one-off race decided the title when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the race calendar, lost ground on the leading group during the ride after her bike's rear tyre was punctured, before storming past the USA's Zaferes midway through the run section to take an impressive silver for Great Britain. I achieved my dream of winning a gold medal, but also winning Bermuda's first gold medal.

> The global economy's business-as-usual approach to climate change has seen Earth's "Vital signs" deteriorate to record levels, an influential group of scientists said Wednesday, warning that several climate tipping points were now imminent. The researchers, part of a group of more than 14,000 scientists who have signed on to an initiative declaring a worldwide climate emergency, said that governments had consistently failed to address the root cause of climate change: "The overexploitation of the Earth". "We need to stop treating the climate emergency as a stand-alone issue - global heating is not the sole symptom of our stressed Earth system," said William Ripple, distinguished professor of ecology at Oregon State University's College of Forestry.
