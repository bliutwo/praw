> It’s weird how radical Muslims (like the Taliban) are so hardline on covering women to protect their “dignity”, yet they are the biggest offenders when it comes to taking away those women’s “dignity”.

## Canada's Justin Trudeau Pledges Two-Year Ban on Foreign Home Buyers

Summary of [original article](https://therealdeal.com/2021/08/25/canadian-pm-trudeau-pledges-two-year-ban-on-foreign-home-buyers/?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=after_article&utm_campaign=related_article):

> Canada's soaring housing market has left some domestic buyers priced out, leading the country's prime minister to make a radical pledge on the campaign trail: a temporary ban on foreign home buyers. Trudeau certainly isn't alone in calling out foreign buyers from the bully pulpit. Erin O'Toole, leader of the Conservatives, is also proposing a ban on foreign home buyers for at least two years, as well as the refurbishing of 15 percent of federal buildings for housing.

> Ban [Investment Firms](https://slate.com/business/2021/06/blackrock-invitation-houses-investment-firms-real-estate.amp) and their shell companies from buying single family properties, full stop. Let them buy a small % of huge office buildings if they want, but do not price people out of home ownership.

> Edit: The article I linked above discusses homes in the US, but the issue is not isolated to one country.

## COVID Vaccines Show No Signs of Harming Fertility or Sexual Function

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-vaccines-show-no-signs-of-harming-fertility-or-sexual-function/):

> The U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency found this month that "There is no pattern ... to suggest that any of the COVID-19 vaccines used in the UK increase the risk of congenital anomalies or birth complications. Pregnant women have reported similar suspected reactions to the vaccines as people who are not pregnant." The vaccines show no fertility effects, including among people using assisted reproductive techniques. Separately, MHRA found no link between menstrual disorders and COVID vaccines.

> I heard a conspiracy theory that the vaccine is actually a sterilization campaign to mitigate climate change. I knew it couldn't be true, because our leaders would never do anything useful about climate change.

## India woman who accused MP of rape dies in self-immolation

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58328014):

> The death of a 24-year-old Indian woman, who had set herself on fire last week after alleging harassment by police and judiciary at the behest of an MP she had accused of rape, has once again put the spotlight on the shameful treatment of women in India. The woman had accused Atul Rai, an MP from the regional Bahujan Samaj Party, of raping her at his home in Varanasi city and registered a police complaint against him in May 2019.Mr Rai, who denies the accusation, was arrested a month later and has been in jail for the past two years. The horrific self-immolation by the 24-year-old woman is not the first time that a woman from the state, accusing an influential man of rape, had to take such a drastic step to be taken seriously by the authorities.

> A group of five Afghan women landed in Mexico City Tuesday after being granted refugee status. "We extend to you the warmest welcome on behalf of all Mexicans," said Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Marcelo Ebrad as he greeted the women during a news conference in Mexico City's airport. Mexico has not granted any other Afghan refugees asylum in the country, leading critics of the government to argue that the case of the robotics team is nothing more than a public relations stunt pulled off by the government.

> People seem to be rushing with their “but” and “actually!” Just to throw some snarky remark about Mexico, yes Mexico has issues and as a society it’s necessary to work on them and address them but it’s ridiculous to dismiss helping people into safety which México had done in the past with both Venezuelan and Haitian groups.
> 
> To those barking about “they’re only taking 5” they’re open to take thousands and within the same day we got a report of another [124 refugees from Afghanistan being taken in.](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/media-news/2021/08/mexico-welcomes-124-afghan-refugee-journalists-families/)
