## Chinese flower has evolved to be less visible due to people picking them

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/20/chinese-flower-fritillaria-delavayi-evolved-less-visible-pickers):

> The conspicuous small plant has one deadly enemy: people, who harvest the flower for traditional Chinese medicine. The bulb of the fritillary species has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years but high prices in recent years have led to increased harvesting. "Many plants seem to use camouflage to hide from herbivores that may eat them - but here we see camouflage evolving in response to human collectors."It's possible that humans have driven evolution of defensive strategies in other plant species, but surprisingly little research has examined this.

## Trump administration pulls out of Open Skies treaty with Russia

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/527056-us-withdraws-from-open-skies-treaty-with-russia):

> The Trump administration has officially withdrawn from the Open Skies treaty, six months after starting the process to leave. "On May 22, 2020, the United States exercised its right pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article XV of the Treaty on Open Skies by providing notice to the Treaty Depositaries and to all States Parties of its decision to withdraw from the Treaty, effective six months from the notification date," State Department deputy spokesman Cale Brown said in a statement. "In the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress reaffirmed its support for the Open Skies Treaty and specifically mandated the administration justify a withdrawal four months before any formal notification of withdrawal took place. President Trump brazenly ignored the law and is unilaterally imposing a politically-charged withdrawal, even after losing a presidential election."

`/u/KimPeek` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jz0tz0/trump_administration_pulls_out_of_open_skies/):

> As an American, I disagree with the withdrawal. Neither the US nor Russia need this treaty to be in place in order to conduct surveillance, but other countries do. The US withdrawal weakens the treaty and jeopardizes the ability for other nations to conduct their monitoring. Those countries live with significantly higher threat of a Russian invasion.

> PARIS - France denounced a tweet by Pakistan's human rights minister on Saturday, which compared President Emmanuel Macron's treatment of Muslims to the way Jews were treated by Nazis in World War II.As tensions continue to simmer between the European nation and the Islamic world, Shireen Mazari, a former journalist and an active member of Prime Minister Imran Khan's team, wrote that "Macron is doing to Muslims what the Nazis did to the Jews.". The protests came after Macron vowed to fight "Islamist separatism," which he said was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities around France. His comments were also condemned by a number of Muslim political leaders, including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan who said last month that Macron had "Attacked Islam," and "Hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe and across the world."

> 
> Meanwhile bootlickers who use these types of reports to justify anti-science narratives completely miss the point that our government could have, and should have done a lot more to help working class people, instead of funding corporate handouts with taxpayer money and helping the rich get richer.
