## Merkel faces pressure to drop Russian gas pipeline after Navalny’s poisoning

Summary of [original article](https://m.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-faces-pressure-to-drop-russian-gas-pipeline-after-navalny-s-poisoning/story-cb4jKpOMpZf5hEYZVR7ibI.html):

> Updated: Sep 03, 2020 14:34 IST. Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure from within her own party to drop support for a controversial gas pipeline with Russia after links point to the Kremlin in the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Merkel said tests showed "Unequivocally" that Navalny was poisoned by a military-grade novichok nerve agent and called on the Russian government to provide answers. Before a special German armed forces laboratory confirmed Navalny's poisoning with novichok, the chancellor decoupled the status of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from the attack on the Putin critic.

## US will not pay remaining dues to WHO after Trump pulls out. The United States currently owes the WHO some $18 million for financial year 2019 and $62 million for financial year 2020.

Summary of [original article](https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/north-america/2020/09/03/us-will-not-pay-remaining-dues-to-who-after-trump-pulls-out):

> The United States will not pay some $80 million it owes the World Health Organization and will instead redirect the money to help pay its United Nations bill in New York, a US official said on Wednesday. Under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress, Trump had to give one-year notice of the US withdrawal from the WHO and is required to pay what Washington's owes for the organization's current fiscal year. "Those together are being reprogrammed to the UN to pay the regular UN assessment," said Cook, referring to money that Washington is required to pay the United Nations in New York.

## French reporter who joined police exposes racism and violence

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/03/french-reporter-who-joined-police-exposes-racism-and-violence-valentin-gendrot?):

> A French journalist who infiltrated the country's police force has described a culture of racism and violence in which officers act with impunity. "I wanted to go undercover in a police commissariat so I could show what we never see. In France there are two big taboos: police violence and malpractice and police suicides. In France, people either like the police or detest them. I thought it had to be more nuanced," he told the Guardian. "I can only say what happened at that particular police station while I was there. I cannot talk about other police stations or the police in general. This book is a factual account of my time with the police," Gendrot says.

> It is not the first time these kind of "undercover" studies are done. I remember a sociologist who did that both in France and in the UK. The difference of violence culture and trust from the population was striking between the two approach. In France, you have a gun, and you protect the people in danger. In the UK, you don't have a gun, and the end goal is being able to wander alone in the district by servicing the population. Conflict resolution in France is quick and violent. In the UK, it is slow and diplomatic.

## Brazil handed out so much cash to people during Covid that poverty is nearing historic low - Brazil implemented one of the most ambitious social programs ever undertaken, giving 66 million people 600 reais a month, a shocking shift under President Jair Bolsonaro.

Summary of [original article](https://theprint.in/world/brazil-handed-out-so-much-cash-to-people-during-covid-that-poverty-is-nearing-historic-low/494714/):

> Brasilia: Brazil, which has suffered one of the world's worst pandemic tolls, has responded to the crisis by distributing so much cash directly to citizens that poverty and inequality are approaching national historic lows. Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advised lawmakers on the legislation for emergency aid, said this is a wider phenomenon: "Bolsonaro has realized the obvious: Brazil is a poor country with lots of poor people and if you give them cash transfers you'll get their votes." "They are not right to be calling for fiscal adjustment now. Brazil has an epidemic that's completely out of control with a lot of people that, had they not received an emergency basic income program, would have probably died."-Bloomberg.
