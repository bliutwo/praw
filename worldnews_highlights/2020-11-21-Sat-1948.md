Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8968569/Vote-Mexico-brings-worlds-largest-legal-weed-market-one-step-closer.html):

> Mexico's Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly signed off on a landmark cannabis bill that could pave the way to the creation of the world's largest legal marijuana market if the initiative passes the next hurdle in the lower house of Congress.

## We've now found microplastics on the very highest and lowest points on Earth. Mount Everest is littered with them. They have also been found in human poop, Arctic ice, and the Mariana Trench 36,000 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/mount-everest-summit-microplastics-study-national-geographic-2020-11):

> "To now know these plastics are in the deepest part of the ocean, on the sea surface, in the soil, and in snow on top of Mount Everest is very eye opening," Napper said. The material accounted for 56% of the microplastics Napper found in the Everest samples. Typically, microplastics are an ocean problem: One study estimated that there's between 15 and 51 trillion pieces - up to 261,000 tons - of microplastics in the oceans.

> So, what are we going to do about the plastics CEOs who knew full well about this, lied under multiple oaths, and continue to profit?
> 
> They all have names and faces. This tragedy was purposefully committed for profit and it's frankly unacceptable for it to go unpunished. They need to be tried and held accountable.

## Simulations suggest geoengineering would not stop global warming if greenhouse gasses continue to increase | Computer simulations suggest that using geoengineering to cool the planet would not be enough to overcome greenhouse effects if emissions continue at the current rate

Summary of [original article](https://phys.org/news/2020-11-simulations-geoengineering-global-greenhouse-gasses.html):

> A trio of researchers, two with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the other the California Institute of Technology, developed computer simulations suggesting that using geoengineering to cool the planet would not be enough to overcome greenhouse effects if emissions continue at the current rate. Geoengineering to reduce global warming would involve emitting particulate material into the stratosphere to reflect heat from the sun back into space.
