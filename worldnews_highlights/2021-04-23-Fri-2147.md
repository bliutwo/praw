## People across India scrambled for life-saving oxygen supplies on Friday and patients lay dying outside hospitals as the capital recorded the equivalent of one death from COVID-19 every five minutes

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/fire-covid-19-hospital-kills-12-india-struggles-with-huge-second-wave-2021-04-23/):

> India reported the world's highest daily tally of coronavirus infections for a second day on Friday, surpassing 330,000 new cases, as it struggles with a health system overwhelmed by patients and plagued by accidents. Deaths in the past 24 hours also jumped to a record 2,263, the health ministry said, while officials across northern and western India, including the capital, New Delhi, warned most hospitals were full and running out of oxygen. Health experts say India got complacent in the winter, when new cases were running at about 10,000 a day and seemed to be under control, and lifted restrictions to allow big gatherings.

> But the prime minister allowed the world's biggest festival to continue where 5 million people bathed together with basically no masks or social distancing and whereby over 2000 people were tested covid positive on site - because religious votes mean everything. Also he and the other politicians have encouraged mass election rallies across the country. I hope he winning the election was worth the thousands of deaths

> Completely agree with this thought process. The Phase 3 clinical trial is scheduled to roll out and hopefully it gets results soon after. This vaccine is being made by the same institute that created the AstraZeneca vaccine so I have some hope.

Theres a chance that the user edited it between the last time I saw it and it getting deleted, but honestly I have to wonder if the mods here are in support of whats happening over there instead of being willing to acknowledge how wrong it is and condemn it.

## Navalny ends hunger strike after being seen by civilian doctors

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/23/navalny-ends-hunger-strike-after-being-seen-by-civilian-doctors):

> Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny said on Friday he would begin gradually ending a hunger strike he had called to demand proper medical care, suggesting that support inside Russia and the West had got him much of what he needed. Navalny announced an end to his hunger strike on its 24th day after a medical trade union that supports him and which has treated him in the past appealed to him to start eating again or risk death. Navalny launched his hunger strike on March 31 after saying that prison authorities had refused him access to a doctor of his choosing despite his complaints of acute back and leg pain.
