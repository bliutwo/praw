> Yeah, I live in a huge metro area and the drastic drop in tourism dollars can be felt far and wide. I used to work in the hotel industry and the majority of my former colleagues have lost their jobs (I lost mine too, but ended up changing industries quickly since I could see the writing on the wall). There's predictions that our travel industry-adjacent jobs won't return to pre-COVID numbers for 5 or more years. Wtf is everyone supposed to do in the meantime? There are literally not enough jobs to go around.

> edit: Just to clarify since I'm getting a ton of suggestions for jobs to apply for - I am not unemployed. I lost my hospitality job and was hired in a different industry.

## World's richest ten people 'are half a Trillion dollars richer since Covid-19 pandemic began'

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9182661/Oxfam-urges-radical-economic-rejig-post-COVID-world.html):

> The world's ten richest people, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, have seen their collective wealth increase by half a trillion dollars since the start of the Covid pandemic, according to a new report. Oxfam said the richest 1,000 people have already managed to recoup the losses they recorded in the early days of the pandemic because of the bounce back in stock markets. Using data specially provided by the World Bank, Oxfam said that in a worst-case scenario global poverty levels would be higher in 2030 than they were before the pandemic struck, with 3.4billion people still living on less than $5.50 a day.

> Walmart, Amazon, home depot, etc, are all notorious for forcing small business out of business... Now they get the government to do it for them.

Dr. Michaud reports that in nearly all those scans and X-rays she's reviewed, she's seen damage to the lungs, even if the patient had barely any symptoms or none at all related to the lungs.

Changes to the constitution will allow Mr Putin to stay in power until 2036.Relations lowest in years Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent, he said was slipped to him by state security agents in August.

## For the First Time in 200 Years, a New Blue Pigment Is Up for Sale

Summary of [original article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/first-blue-pigment-discovered-200-years-finally-sale-180976769/):

> In 2009, researchers at Oregon State University discovered YInMn Blue-the first new blue pigment identified in 200 years-while developing materials for use in electronics. Named after its chemical components of yttrium, indium and manganese oxides, YInMn absorbs red and green wavelengths while reflecting blue wavelengths to produce a bright blue color. Prior to YInMn Blue, the last commercially manufactured, inorganic blue pigment was cobalt, which was discovered in 1802 and first produced in France in 1807, according to My Modern Met's Emma Taggart.
