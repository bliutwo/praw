> New Zealanders are poised to elect the 'gayest parliament in the world' in September, vaulting the South Pacific nation past the world-leading United Kingdom for representation. A Human Rights Commission report on rainbow human rights in New Zealand, issued last week, identified major deficiencies and "Discrimination when it comes to basic human rights like access to quality healthcare, education and work". New Zealand does not have a go-to government agency for rainbow issues, something Ms Logie would like to change.

## Risk of never fully recovering after coronavirus ‘very real,’ scientists say

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7111094/coronavirus-scientists-health-problems/):

> Scientists are only starting to grasp the vast array of health problems caused by the novel coronavirus, some of which may have lingering effects on patients and health systems for years to come, according to doctors and infectious disease experts. While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization, but are still suffering months after first becoming infected. Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine, reviewed current scientific literature and found about half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had neurological complications, such as dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness and muscle pain.

> A new report by the Angus Reid Institute suggests the majority of Canadians support the idea of a shorter work week. Support for the idea of a shorter work week is growing in popularity in Canada as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend the working lives of Canadians, according to a new study by the Angus Reid Institute. More than half of Canadians surveyed by the non-profit research centre said it would be a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week standard in Canada, the study found.

`/u/HTC864` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hh9v28/half_of_canadians_would_support_30hour_work_week/):

Summary of [original article](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/hawaii-group-sets-record-for-largest-haul-of-plastic-removed-from-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch/):

> Ocean Voyages Institute says it made history this week, returning to the port of Honolulu Tuesday, after successfully removing 103 tons of fishing nets and consumer plastics from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Known as the 'Ghost Net Buster,' Mary Crowley is renowned for developing effective methods to remove significant amounts of plastics out of the ocean, including 48 tons of plastics during two ocean clean-up voyages in 2019, including one that scooped up nets that had trapped garbage around the Hawaiian islands. Ocean Voyages Institute unloaded the record-breaking haul of ocean plastic debris this week while docked alongside Pier 29, thanks to the support of Honolulu-based Matson, in preparation for upcycling and proper disposal.

> 48 days and 100 tons. I’m so glad someone is out there doing this as the planet desperately needs people exactly like this. 
> 
> But the operating costs for that ship and crew along with the sheer physical labor used to gather that plastic must be huge. I hope how ever these guys are paying for this trip doesn’t dry up . These are the people who are actually living to help the earth . Props to them , let’s hope it continues and they actually do expand like he says.

"If we don't receive urgent funding, children will be on the edge of starvation and many will die," expressed Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF representative in Yemen.

## While coronavirus spread in the U.S., an Indian slum with 1 million residents contained it

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-24/dharavi-slum-in-mumbai-india-contained-covid-19):

> Dharavi has reported more than 2,000 cases and 79 deaths overall, far lower percentages than the rest of Mumbai, a sprawling megacity of some 20 million people that has become the epicenter of the disease in India. The city assigned 2,450 health workers to Dharavi alone - about 30 of whom would eventually test positive for COVID-19. "Instead of people reporting it, we started chasing the virus," said Kiran Dighavkar, an assistant commissioner of the Mumbai ward that includes Dharavi.

> My cousin recently stopped in America (Chicago, then Houston) due to a work trip. (He’s born and raised Indian).
> 
> He was STUNNED by what he described as a complete lack of caution by America, particularly in Houston. I couldn’t answer him when he asked how there isn’t a greater effort nationwide to curb the disease after 120,000 people had died.
> 
> Edit: since multiple people are asking, someone has asked, let me elaborate how and why my cousin is traveling, to my knowledge. Details may be incomplete since I don’t get to talk to him much and there’s a bit of a language barrier.
> 
> My cousin works for a maritime shipping company as a crewman for cargo ships. Cargo ships are essential business that continues to run despite the pandemic. He left India via a charter flight, not subject to the ban on international travel in India at the moment. I don’t know the exact details of getting on the flight but I know it was not an easy thing for him or his company to manage.
