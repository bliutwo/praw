> Is the average Chinese citizen supportive of CCP rule. Is there any scope of an popular uprising in the near future against CCP rule of the kind that happened in Warsaw pact countries. And what is the general opinion among ordinary Chinese regarding Tibet, Hong Kong and the Uighurs.

> According to Der Spiegel, the pair form part of a network founded by Eckhardt, who also lives in Cape Breton. Eckhardt, Der Spiegel reports, is a so-called Reichsbuerger - a person who feels the modern German state that arose after the Nazi defeat doesn't have legitimacy. Der Spiegel reports that at the end of 2019, Interpol staff based in Ottawa informed German intelligence of Eckhardt's activities in this country, but Herman and Popp have denied links to Eckhardt.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/un-warns-america-against-excessive-force-portland-officers-seen-shoving-medics-ground-1520292?utm_source=Public&utm_medium=Feed&utm_campaign=Distribution):

> The United Nations, on Friday, urged America to avoid using excessive force against protesters and journalists, following a viral video that shows volunteer medics being shoved to the ground by police officers in Portland, Oregon. During the news briefing, Throssell also urged authorities to ensure that federal and local police were "Clearly identified," after photos have shown officers covering their badge numbers when using excessive force against protesters. In Portland, protesters and police officers have continued to clash, and a recently viral video shows two volunteer medics being pushed to the ground by law enforcement officials during a protest.

> I watched the video of police beating medics with red plus sign tags all over them.  On their backpacks and shoulders and everything.
> 
> If the police can’t recognize medics, they should not be police.  This is a crime in war, and even worse when it’s against your own citizens.

## Narcissists and psychopaths are more likely to refuse to wear masks, Says New Research

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/narcissists-psychopaths-face-mask-requirement-mandate-social-distancing-covid-19-coronavirus-1519732):

> Respondents demonstrating Dark Triad traits-so-called because their malevolent qualities correlate with more crime, less compassion and dangerous leadership qualities-were more likely to hoard and less likely to take preventive measures. The results correspond well with previous research into individuals with Dark Triad personality traits, who tend to be more impulsive, short-sighted, competitive and risk-taking. While psychopaths and narcissists may be less likely to comply with coronavirus restrictions, the evidence doesn't suggest that personality disorders are to blame for social-distancing failures and mask-mandate pushback.

## Vietnam, one of Asia's biggest consumers of wildlife products, has suspended all imports of wild animal species "dead or alive -- their eggs... parts or derivatives" and vowed to "eliminate" illegal markets across the country.

Summary of [original article](https://www.ibtimes.com/vietnam-suspends-wildlife-trade-pandemic-prods-action-3016571):

> The country will also "Resolutely eliminate market and trading sites which trade wildlife illegally", the edict said - warning of a crackdown on the poaching, trafficking, storing and advertising of animals, birds and reptiles. Anti-trafficking group Freeland hailed the move as the most stringent to control the wildlife trade since the pandemic broke out. Vietnam has gone further by taking aim at online sales and imposing an indefinite ban on the trade.

## A doctor has run 22 miles to work and back wearing a mask to help stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around face coverings and to raise funds for charity. He recorded that oxygen levels never fell below 98% of what it would usually be.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/masks-covid-19-doctor-oxygen-1520060):

> A doctor has run 22 miles to work and back wearing a mask to help stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around face coverings and to raise funds for charity. Tom Lawton, who works at the Bradford Royal Infirmary in Yorkshire, north England, said he decided to run with the mask on, following his concerns for people with respiratory illnesses who want to wear a mask but are too scared to do so over false information. "To make up for the fact that I'm fit and healthy, I thought if I'm running then I'm using 10 times the amount of oxygen as I would if I'm just sat here. If I can show that I can get 10 peoples worth of oxygen through the mask then hopefully someone who has a respiratory disease and wants to wear a mask, they can be reassured that it is safe thing to do."

`/u/peter-doubt` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hwyruv/a_doctor_has_run_22_miles_to_work_and_back/):

> Anyone using that excuse should be told to bring oxygen *and* a mask.  Their lungs would be chronically ill, already.
