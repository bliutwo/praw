> Scientists ARE being allowed in, according to the article. Some, and we don't know their affiliation, are being denied access to SOME of the caves...ok.
> 
> As for blocking journalists, that's absolutely the BEST move. Having a bunch of noobs running around caves known to be host to infection vectors then flying back to their home countries is a great way to spread another plague.
> 
> China seems to be cautious here, but scientists are being given access while the media isn't. That's kinda prudent, given the situation.

## Two dormant volcanoes on Martinique and St. Vincent and the Grenadines begin to rumble and smoke

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9099553/Eastern-Caribbean-issues-rare-alerts-rumbling-volcanoes.html):

> Volcanoes that have been quiet for decades are rumbling to life in the eastern Caribbean, prompting officials to issue alerts in Martinique and St. Vincent and the Grenadines - a chain of islands home to more than 100,000 people. The most recent warning was issued late Tuesday for La Soufriere volcano in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as strong gas emissions, formation of a new volcanic dome and changes to its crater lake. Klemetti said the most active volcano in recent years in the eastern Caribbean has been Soufriere Hills in Montserrat, which has erupted continuously since 1995, destroying the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.Seventeen of the eastern Caribbean´s 19 live volcanoes are located on 11 islands, with the remaining two are underwater near the island of Grenada, including one called Kick `Em Jenny that has been active in recent years.

## Scottish Leader Tells EU 'Scotland Will Be Back Soon,' Renewing Talks of Independence

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/scottish-leader-tells-eu-scotland-will-back-soon-renewing-talks-independence-1558409):

> The tweet echoed comments she had made during a November 30 virtual meeting of the Scottish National Party of which she is the head. During her comments, she argued that Scotland should be an independent nation so it can direct its own economy and future better than the largely English-dominated union of Great Britain currently allows. "Should it be Scottish Government of whatever party elected by the people of Scotland and with the priorities and interests of Scotland at heart, or Westminster governments that time and again we have rejected?". Johnson has said that he would oppose such a split, stating that the union makes both countries economically stronger and more capable of weathering the pandemic, but Sturgeon and Scottish voters apparently disagree and may soon have the votes to prove it.

`/u/monsieursquirrel` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ko8cwz/scottish_leader_tells_eu_scotland_will_be_back/):

> The SNP have been banging on about becoming independent and rejoining the EU for years. They need to show that they have a plan to achieve it. Even if they have public support, Westminster won't approve a break up. They need to find some other political or legal mechanism.

> 2 Min Read.BERLIN - Banned from setting off fireworks in much of their city, some Berliners instead tried to launch them from their homes on New Year's Eve, leading to dozens of fires across the German capital. Berlin revellers usually take to the streets to light up the sky with fireworks on New Year's Eve but authorities banned the use of fireworks in certain public places, including more than 50 zones in the capital, to discourage large crowds from gathering. The sale of fireworks was also prohibited in the run up to Dec. 31 in Germany, which is locked down with only essential shops open until at least Jan. 10 to try to suppress the new coronavirus.
