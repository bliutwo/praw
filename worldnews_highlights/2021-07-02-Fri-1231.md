## More Churches Up in Flames in Canada as Outrage Against Catholic Church Grows

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dnyk/more-churches-torched-in-canada-as-outrage-against-catholics-grows):

> Another two Catholic Churches have been torched in Canada, as more Indigenous Nations have confirmed unmarked graves at residential school sites that likely hold the remains of Indigenous children. At 3 a.m. on Wednesday, firefighters were called to a century-old Roman Catholic church just north of Edmonton after it lit up in flames. Across Canada, calls are mounting for the country and the Catholic Church to face criminal charges for crimes against humanity and genocide, and many life-long Catholics are considering leaving the church altogether.

## More graves are found at Canadian schools for the indigenous

Summary of [original article](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/03/more-graves-are-found-at-canadian-schools-for-the-indigenous):

> Ground-penetrating radar confirmed what indigenous groups have long suspected: that more children died at these schools than was previously thought. The number of graves has shocked Canadians, even though many indigenous people had complained about the residential schools for decades. In 2016 a Canadian human-rights tribunal found that the government spent less money on reserves on programmes to support families; as a result indigenous children were more likely to be taken from their homes.

`/u/100LittleButterflies` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/occmzl/more_graves_are_found_at_canadian_schools_for_the/):

> I'm honestly happy. We *knew* there were massive graves for decades. Now they can finally be brought home. People can find closure. And now the truth cannot be denied or swept under the rug. I really hope this is a step in a good direction.
