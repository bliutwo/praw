> 2 Min Read.BARNALA, India - More than 100,000 farmers and farm workers gathered in India's northern Punjab state on Sunday in a show of strength against new farm laws, where union leaders called on supporters to amass outside the capital New Delhi on Feb. 27.Tens of thousands of Indian growers have already been camped outside Delhi for nearly three months, demanding the repeal of the three reform laws that they say will hurt them and benefit large corporations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which introduced the laws last September, has offered to defer the laws but refused to abandon them, arguing that legislation will help farmers get better prices. At Sunday's rally at a grain market in Barnala, a town in Punjab, union leaders outlined plans to mobilise farmers and farm workers from across the northern state and move to a protest site outside Delhi later this month.

## Trump offered Kim Jong Un a ride home on Air Force One after their second summit, new series reveals

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-offered-kim-jong-un-ride-air-force-one-report-2021-2):

> Former President Donald Trump offered North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a ride home on Air Force One after the two met for a second time at a summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2019, a new BBC documentary has revealed. The three-part series, titled "Trump Takes On the World," discloses new details about how Trump and Kim negotiated North Korea's nuclear program, which eventually ended without a deal. "President Trump offered Kim a lift home on Air Force One," Matthew Pottinger, the top Asia expert on Trump's National Security Council, told the BBC. "The president knew that Kim had arrived on a multi-day train ride through China into Hanoi and the president said: 'I can get you home in two hours if you want.' It was a gracious gesture," he added.

`/u/shelcod` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/lozsmw/trump_offered_kim_jong_un_a_ride_home_on_air/):

> Trumps relationship with Kim Jong In is the weirdest part of Trump's whole presidency in my opinion. Trump went from threatening Kim with nuclear war on Twitter, to telling other G7 leaders that Kim is a great guy. What reason could Trump have to all of the sudden be best friends with Kim Jong Un?

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - U.S. regulators announced extra inspections on Boeing Co 777 jets using the same type of engine that shed debris over Denver on Saturday, while Japan went further and suspended their use while it considers what action to take. Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc to suspend the use of 777s with P&W4000 engines while it considered whether to take additional measures. "Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes."

## Study finds one in six New Zealanders exposed to high levels of nitrates in tap water, links to bowel cancer

Summary of [original article](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/02/study-finds-one-in-six-kiwis-exposed-to-high-levels-of-nitrates-in-tap-water-links-to-bowel-cancer.html):

> "We have the highest rates of colorectal cancer in the world, in NZ, and the highest rates within NZ correlate to where those high nitrate levels are in groundwater and drinking water," Joy said. "It's one of the first studies to try and pull together a nitrate contamination data set and look at this issue. It's concerning because we do have high levels of nitrates in our drinking water, and it's likely to get higher with dairy intensification." A Danish study monitoring 2.7 million people over 23 years found a significant increase in bowel cancer risk at just 0.87mg/litre of nitrate-nitrogen per litre of water.

## 'Name it for what it is': MPs implore PM to label China's treatment of Uighurs a genocide

> OTTAWA - Federal MPs are making their case to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to join them in voting to label China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims a genocide ahead of Monday's House of Commons vote on the matter. The Conservatives introduced a motion on Thursday calling for the formal recognition of the situation in China's Xinjiang province as a genocide. "We are looking at that question right now, certainly what is happening with the Uighurs is of great concern to our government, and to me personally as minister of justice. We are certainly working with international allies but there are consequences, important consequences, positive consequences to applying the term genocide. So we are studying the matter carefully," Lametti said.
