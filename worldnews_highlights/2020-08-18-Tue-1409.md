## Female-led countries handled coronavirus better, study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel):

> Countries led by women had "Systematically and significantly better" Covid-19 outcomes, research appears to show, locking down earlier and suffering half as many deaths on average as those led by men. The analysis of 194 countries, published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the World Economic Forum, suggests the difference is real and "May be explained by the proactive and coordinated policy responses" adopted by female leaders. Since only 19 of the nearly 200 countries were led by women, the authors also created so-called "Nearest neighbour" countries to offset the small sample size, pairing Germany, New Zealand and Bangladesh with male-led Britain, Ireland and Pakistan.

> Probably more to do with countries the are more progressive. If you have a female leader you are in a progressive country.

## China's Xi Jinping facing widespread opposition in his own party, insider claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/china-xi-jinping-facing-widespread-opposition-in-his-own-party-claims-insider?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other):

> A former professor at China's elite Central Party School has issued an unprecedented rebuke of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, accusing him of "Killing a country" and claiming that many more want out of the ruling Chinese Communist party. She said there was widespread opposition within the party but few dared to speak out, afraid of political retaliation in the form of internal party discipline and corruption charges. Cai said she believed that discontent within the party was widespread, especially among her generation as well as among higher-level officials who came up through the party during China's reform era under Deng Xiaoping, and later as China fully integrated into the global economy following its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.

> 
> A former professor of China’s elite Central Party School has issued an unprecedented rebuke of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, accusing him of “killing a country” and claiming that many more want out of the ruling Chinese communist party.
> 
> Cai Xia, a prominent professor who taught at the school for training top officials, was expelled from the partyon Monday after an [audio recording](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2020/06/translation-former-party-professor-calls-ccp-a-political-zombie/) of remarks she made that were critical of Xi was leaked online in June. The school said in a notice that Cai, a professor at the party school since 1992, had made comments that “damaged the country’s reputation” and were full of “serious political problems”.
> 
> In her first interview with English-language media since her expulsion, Cai told the Guardian she was “happy to be expelled.”
> 
> 
> “Under the regime of Xi, the Chinese communist party is not a force for progress for China. In fact, it is an obstacle to China’s progress,” she said. “I believe I am not the only one who wants to leave this party. More people would like to withdraw or quit this party,” she said. “I had intended to quit the party years ago when there was no more room to speak and my voice was completely blocked.”
> 
> Comments like this from someone once firmly part of the establishment – several of China’s leaders such as Mao Zedong, Hu Jintao as well as Xi were head of the Central Party School – are remarkable and potentially dangerous for the Chinese leadership. Cai is the latest prominent public intellectual to be punished.
> 
> Cai initially spoke to the Guardian in June after the recording was first released. Then, she went further in her denunciation of the top leader, blaming him for making China the “enemy of the world” in comments that will reverberate across the party and country where such public criticisms from within the party establishment are extremely rare.
> 
> On Tuesday Cai, who initially asked that her interview not be published because of threats she and her family received, said she was now willing to speak out. “I have much more freedom now. My speech is free from any constraints. I am responsible only for my own conscience and principles,” she said.
> 
> 
> She said there was widespread opposition within the party but few dared to speak out, afraid of political retaliation in the form of internal party discipline and corruption charges. In this environment Xi’s “unchecked power” and hold on all major decision-making had led to inevitable mistakes such as the Covid-19 outbreak, according to Cai.
> 
> Beijing has blamed the suppression of information on the outbreak in Wuhan on local officials. Chinese health officials only said on 20 January that the virus was contagious, weeks after it had emerged in December. But a speech published by the party magazine Qiushi showed that Xi had met with the politburo and given instructions on the needed virus response on 7 January, almost two weeks before the public had been warned
> 
> 
> “If he knew on January 7, why did it take until January 20th to announce the outbreak? In other words, the fact that people were concealing the news from him is the result of the system,” said Cai, adding: “But when he knew the situation on 7 January, he did not make it public or mobilise resources. So shouldn’t he bear responsibility?”
> 
> Cai, who said she had wanted to leave the party since 2016 as the space for discussion within the party shrunk dramatically, also blamed the country’s international problems on Xi.
> 
> “When no one can oppose him, that means that his power is unlimited,” she said. “He has made the world an enemy. At home, all these big issues are left to him to decide. In other words, whether it is a domestic or international issue, it is very difficult for others to restrict him. It is inevitable that his judgement and decisions will be mistaken,” she said.
> 
> “It is a vicious cycle. After a wrong decision is made, the result is not good. But those below are too afraid to tell him and wrong decisions continue to be made until the situation is out of control. In this vicious cycle, there is no way to stop the country from sliding toward disaster.”
> 
> Cai said she believed that discontent within the party was widespread, especially among her generation as well as higher level officials who came up through the party during China’s reform era under Deng Xiaoping and later as China fully integrated into the global economy following its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.
> 
> “Those within the party have experienced the last 20, 30 years and they understand in which direction is right and which is a dead end,” she said. “We are among a group of cadres who joined the party after reform and opening. So that is why I say everyone is very clear about what is happening.”
> 
> Cai said on Tuesday: “Many of my good friends who saw the news of me being expelled are cheering. They think this is a good thing.”

## Senate committee: Trump admin hampered Russia probe

Summary of [original article](https://www.teletrader.com/senate-committee-trump-admin-hampered-russia-probe/news/details/52994933?internal=1):

> The United States Senate Intelligence Committee accused the administration of President Donald Trump of hampering and prolonging its Russia 2016 election interference investigation. The committee's fifth and final report on the Russia probe also stated that former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked with Konstantin Kilimnik who was designated as "a Russian intelligence officer." Additionally, the report said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Democratic National Committee email hack and claimed the Trump campaign "Publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia." The committee also said that the Trump campaign attempted to get information from Wikileaks releases through Roger Stone and finally stated that Trump's son, Donald Jr. planned on going to a meeting with people linked to Russia to get some "Derogatory information" that would help Trump enter the White House.

> Oh!  I know!  **Obstruction**.  Which he was impeached for.  Thanks for admitting that he *should have been removed*, since you're finally conceding that he did in fact commit obstruction.

## New gene therapy approach eliminates at least 90% latent herpes simplex virus 1

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-08/fhcr-ngt081420.php):

> Infectious disease researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have used a gene editing approach to remove latent herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, also known as oral herpes. In animal models, the findings show at least a 90 percent decrease in the latent virus, enough researchers expect that it will keep the infection from coming back. The researchers are pursuing a similar strategy for herpes simplex 2, which causes genital herpes.
