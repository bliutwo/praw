> US officials believe that Russia may be behind the suspected directed-energy attacks on US government employees around the world, Politico's Lara Seligman and Andrew Desiderio reported. A congressional official who was briefed on the issue told Politico that US officials told lawmakers that the investigation into the suspected attacks was expanding, and that it was focused on whether the GRU was involved. Politico previously reported that officials were investigating a suspected attack on federal government personnel in Miami last year, as well two suspected attacks on National Security Council officials: one who was walking near the White House and another in Virginia.

## Netanyahu declares state of emergency in Lod due to widespread and violent rioting. This is the first use of emergency powers over an Arab community in Israel since the end of the military administration over the Arabs of Israel in 1966.

> I've been playing The Binding of Isaac for the last 6 hours or so while watching Israeli TV. Here's what I understand of the situation: All major cities that have been known to mark friendship between Muslims and Jews are on fire tonight; Lod, Ramla, Acre and even Haifa. Police are going in almost clueless, even the army is getting involved. This is a first time so many Arab teenagers have been rioting in such a way, randomly throwing rocks at people and Molotov Cocktails at buildings. Almost everything burns.  
>   
> Arab politicians and Mayors have been calling citizens to calm down. Some Jews started to riot against the Muslims on the streets, and it looks like an actual civil war. The government closed Lod and hope to deal with the situation until morning. Some believe that the connection between Muslims and Jews that was built in those towns for 70 years, cannot be mended after tonight. Israeli politicians mumble the usual words and hope for a ceasefire. Hamas has no intentions to stop, shows those videos in Muslim channels and call for more riots. The teenagers get motivated through social networks, mainly Tik-Tok.  
>   
> Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. This looks like an actual war, that's going to end with many more deaths than the 2014 one.

## Hundreds of South Africans rallied on Tuesday against Israeli attacks on Palestinians after at least 28 people were killed following clashes over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210511-south-africans-protest-over-palestinian-deaths):

> Hundreds of South Africans rallied on Tuesday against Israeli attacks on Palestinians after at least 28 people were killed following clashes over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. South Africa openly supports the Palestinian cause with formal diplomatic relations established in 1995, a year after the end of apartheid. Waving the Palestinian green, black, red and white flags, demonstrators marched through the streets of South Africa's second city Cape Town chanting "Free, free Palestine" and "Down Israel, down" causing traffic jams.

> None of this is surprising because most of the actions of the Israeli government and the defenses of the Israeli government reminiscient of apartheid for the following reasons: 
> 
> (i)The forced eviction of Palestinians from their homes in places like Sheikh Jarrah is the exact same thing done under the apartheid system in South Africa under Urban Apartheid. The Group Areas Act of 1950 allowed the South African government to categories urban areas into white, indian and black areas. Whites were allowed to appeal to the governor general if they wanted land in black areas and if the governor general accepted their appeal(which they did in most cases) they were allowed to issue forced evictions of black residents from their homes. It was a crime for black residents to remain in their homes once the eviction notices were set up. 
> 
> That is exactly what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah. Many Palestinians were forced into Sheikh Jarrah because of the expulsions of 1948 just like how many black South Africans were forced into the urban areas to seek jobs following the Native land act of 1913. And just like the blacks in South Africa, you now have settlers appealing to the Supreme Court of Israel to have the authorities forcibly evict Palestinians from their homes so they can settle there. 
> 
> (ii)The use of the language of national security is the exact same thing that was used during Apartheid in South Africa. The Apartheid government specifically developed legislation such as the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 and the Terrorism Act of 1967 that propped up the Apartheid system by categorising groups like the ANC as terrorist organisations. Right now the language of national security is also being used to defend and justify the Apartheid policies that the Israeli government is instituting against the Palestinians. 
> 
> (iii)The "we're surrounded" argument is also the same argument the Apartheid government used. Apartheid South Africa appealed to the notion that "we are surrounded by hostile enemies" all around us among the African states as a justification for their repressive policies inside South Africa. Defenders of the Israeli government are also doing the same thing when they use the "we're surrounded by hostile governments" as a way to justify the repressive policies against the Palestinians
> 
> (iv)The checkpoint system in place is exactly the same as what is being implemented in Apartheid South Africa. You had a pass system which restricted the mobility rights of the Palestinians and stated that they needed a pass to either move to different areas or go in white areas where most of the jobs were concentrated. You have a similar system where the check point system restricts the mobility rights of Palestinians and forces them to have things like a Green card where ever they go. 
> 
> (v)The appeal to a history of oppression is also the same argument that was used to defend Apartheid South Africa. The Jewish community has had a terrible history of antisemitism and discrimination from pogroms, to expulsions, to the Holocaust. That history however is often times exploited as a way to say that because the Jewish community suffered antisemitism, therefore the Israeli government can impose its repressive policies against Palestinians. 
> 
> Apartheid South Africa said the same thing. They argued that the Afrikaners and Boers had a history of oppression from escaping religious persecution in Europe to settle in the Dutch colonies, to the hostile African nations all around them, to the British repressing them and placing them in concentration camps during the Boer War. They exploited that history to then justify their own repressive policies against Black South Africans. 
> 
> So literally almost every argument used to defend the policies of the Israeli government were used by the Apartheid government in South Africa. I want to make it clear. I support Israel's right to exist, their right to exist in peace and to have security. I do not however support a perpetual occupation of Palestinians and the system of racism and apartheid that has been imposed on them. And South Africans themselves in solidarity with Palestinians, agree.

## Israeli energy pipeline hit as Iron Dome fails to intercept missile

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/mid-east/israeli-energy-pipeline-hit-as-iron-dome-fails-to-intercept-missile):

> A pipeline belonging to an Israeli state-owned energy company was hit in a rocket attack as Iron Dome failed to intercept the projectile late Tuesday, Reuters reported citing an Israeli government official and an energy sector official. Two Israeli women were also killed by rockets fired from Gaza in response to recent Israeli aggression in the heavily-targeted coastal city of Ashkelon, just north of Gaza, said the emergency service Magen David Adom. Over 90% of recent rockets from Gaza were reported intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system, Israeli army spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said earlier.
