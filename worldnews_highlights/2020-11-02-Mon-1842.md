> when she voted with the labour party on the controversial foreshore and seabed issue (controversial for the majority of Māori, who were claiming ownership of the foreshore and seabed), she removed herself from the list at the next election and told her constituents (in a Māori electorate, so all Māori voters) she would only return to parliament with their support - they returned her and have done so ever since, increasing her majority from 1,000 to 7,000.

## Covid lockdowns are cost of self-isolation failures, says WHO expert | World news

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/02/covid-lockdowns-are-cost-of-self-isolation-failures-says-who-expert):

> Lockdowns affecting entire populations is a price countries pay for failing to ensure people with coronavirus and their contacts self-isolate, according to an expert from the World Health Organization. "For me, the big missing link in what's going on in many European countries is management of isolation," said Dr Margaret Harris of the WHO. "That's not just isolation of people who are sick - it's isolation of people who have contacts and are first-degree contacts." Early medical monitoring helped with getting people the right treatment, she added, and although it's not yet clear, getting earlier care to people could also save some from the after-effects known as long Covid.

`/u/SpankThuMonkey` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jmlxfm/covid_lockdowns_are_cost_of_selfisolation/):

> Well. There are folk like myself who’d much rather isolate and WFH. 
> 
> But my management seem to think my colleagues and i need to cram 25 of us into an office to fill out spreadsheets. 
> 
> Despite us all owning home computers AND company laptops.
