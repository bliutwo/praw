Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2951GI?il=0):

> 2 Min Read.MEXICO CITY - Mexico's president said on Thursday that women should decide whether the country should legalize abortion, but he declined to take a position on the issue, which is still opposed by many Mexicans. One day after the Argentine Senate voted to make abortion legal, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was asked during a news conference whether he thought his country should follow suit. Abortion is legal in Mexico City and the state of Oaxaca, but it remains prohibited in most of the country except under exceptional circumstances, such as rape.

## Canadian politician faked Twitter posts to conceal Caribbean holiday

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/30/canada-finance-minister-caribbean-vacation-covid-travel-warnings):

> Ontario premier Doug Ford is under pressure after admitting that he has known for weeks that his finance minister - who faked social media posts to conceal his location - had ignored a coronavirus lockdown to go on holiday in the Caribbean. Posts on Rod Phillips's social media accounts suggested that he remained home over Christmas, but it emerged on Tuesday that the minister flew to the island of St Barts in mid-December - despite his own government's advice to avoid non-essential travel. Under Canadian law, Phillips will be required to quarantine for 14 days upon his return to Ontario.
