## Animals were subjected to a string of brutal attacks at a farm that sells goats’ milk to Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and other supermarkets, footage from hidden cameras has revealed. Goats were seen on video being punched, kicked, hit with a pole and slammed onto their backs at a plant.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/goats-milk-st-helens-farm-yoghurt-hit-kick-animal-cruelty-video-a9639021.html):

> Animals were subjected to a string of brutal attacks at a farm that sells goats' milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and other supermarkets, footage from hidden cameras has revealed. Goat milk, yoghurts, cheese and ice cream sold by the St Helen's Farm brand are the best-known goat milk products in the UK and are stocked by major supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Ocado. "St Helen's say on their website the milk is a reward for looking after the goats and that their staff have a genuine interest and love for the animals. But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms."
