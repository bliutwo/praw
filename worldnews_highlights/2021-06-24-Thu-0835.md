Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi announced that the number of adults in the UK with two vaccine jabs has passed 60 per cent, with 82 per cent receiving at least one dose. Latest official figures showed a further 16,135 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases recorded in the UK on Wednesday - the highest since 6 February, and an almost 40 per cent increase in just 24 hours.

## Australia has delivered 'strikingly poor' results on a new human rights scorecard

Summary of [original article](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australia-has-delivered-strikingly-poor-results-on-a-new-human-rights-scorecard):

> The upholding of human rights in Australia did not improve last year and government responses to the coronavirus pandemic caused a range of breaches, especially for vulnerable populations, human rights experts say. The observations are made in the latest Human Rights Measurement Initiative tracker, which logs and compares the human rights performances of about 200 countries across the world. The HRMI is hosted by the Motu Economic and Public Policy Research, a New Zealand-based research institute, and is produced from surveys of hundreds of human rights experts across living the globe, including advocates, lawyers, journalists and NGOs.
