> Navalny is a political opponent. He has never been in opposition government. 
> 
> It's like saying Pauline Hanson is the opposition leader in Australia.

## Japanese government allows taxis to refuse to pick up maskless passengers.

Summary of [original article](https://soranews24.com/2020/11/08/no-mask-no-ride-japanese-government-allows-taxis-to-refuse-to-pick-up-maskless-passengers/):

> Perhaps these maskless passengers don't see a taxi as being the same as other forms of public transportation because they're not sharing the car with strangers-to-them riders, and figure that as long as the driver is wearing a mask they don't need one themselves. Whatever the reason it's something cab drivers aren't happy about, and so a group of 10 Tokyo taxi operating companies recently petitioned the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for the right to refuse to pick up passengers who won't wear a mask. The ministry has now approved the request, officially authorizing recognizing Tokyo taxis to leave the maskless waiting on the curb as they drive away.

> Is Japan having a significant problem with people refusing to wear masks?

## Jair Bolsonaro says he might not run for re-election

Summary of [original article](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Bolsonaro-Loses-Interest-in-Re-Election-After-Trumps-Defeat-20201107-0005.html):

> Over the last 24 hours, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has avoided commenting on the electoral defeat of President Donald Trump. "See how the world is. In South America, there are several countries again painted in red. Many times, the President has no way to change, as I would like to happen, the destiny of Brazil. There are people who want the destination to be another and they may be right," Bolsonaro said on Facebook. "Trump's defeat is a historical defeat of far-right fascists, racists, and deniers of the pandemic and climate change. Hate did not prevail!" the Workers' Party lawmaker Erika Kokay stressed.

## Back from the dead: Race to save Romania's 65 million-year-old fish

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54823866):

> One day in late October, Andrei Togor, a 31-year-old fish biologist, was monitoring angling fish species of the Asprete when he discovered 12 specimens in a small section of the Valsan river. The action plan to save the Asprete also includes ecological restoration of the Valsan river basin, an around-the-clock warden, raising local awareness - and, ultimately, a riverside conservation centre that will double up as a captive breeding facility. "Having some Asprete in captivity could be a back-up, should a catastrophe occur on the river," says Nicolae Craciun, adding that they could potentially repopulate the Arges and Raul Doamnei rivers.
