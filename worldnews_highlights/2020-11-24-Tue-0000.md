> Vatican City: In a new book, Pope Francis for the first time calls China's Muslim Uighurs a "Persecuted" people, something human rights activists have been urging him to do for years. Faith leaders, activist groups and governments have said crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China's remote Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps. Last month, during a conference at the Vatican, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted China over its treatment of Uighurs.
