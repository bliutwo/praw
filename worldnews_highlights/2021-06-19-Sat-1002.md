## New Zealand High Court Overturns Stuart Nash's Decision On Tarakihi Fishing Limits: “When deciding how long a fish stock should take to recover, the minister should consider the biology of the fish, not a voluntary industry plan,” the court said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/court-overturns-ministers-decision-on-tarakihi-fishing-limits):

> The current limits were put in place by Nash in 2019, adding up to a 30 percent reduction in fishing for tarakihi on the east coast. The court found that in setting the 2019 limits, Nash did not take into account official advice on the appropriate limits for rebuilding the fish's threatened east coast population. In a briefing to Nash in 2019, the Fisheries Inshore chair Laws Lawson admitted that tarakihi boats had not been staying out of the crucial juvenile tarakihi habitats they had promised not to fish.

## High greenhouse gas emitters should pay for carbon they produce, says IMF | Greenhouse gas emissions

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/18/high-greenhouse-gas-emitters-should-pay-for-carbon-they-produce-says-imf):

> Companies with high greenhouse gas emissions should be subject to a carbon price of $75 a tonne of carbon dioxide, the International Monetary Fund has said, as a way of reaching the goals of the Paris climate agreement. A carbon floor price would mean that companies, including energy generators and heavy industries, would have to pay for the carbon they produce. Carbon pricing can take many forms in practice, from taxes on fuels to carbon trading systems, such as that operated by the EU, under which businesses are allocated or must buy tradable permits to produce carbon dioxide, with laggards forced to buy the excess permits of those that have cut carbon fastest.

> Even if implemented it's not a solution as the big emitters could afford to destroy us.

> 
> Like people are pretty polarized on the police, and how they do their job. I mean, being a teacher, I know what it is like to have a job that is under high public scrutiny...so I don't do the things that got other teachers nuked.

> That image of a cop kneeling on a helpless restrained person's neck is burned into the collective unconscious of society. But sure, do exactly what Chauvin did, the optics won't blow up in your face...

## Tuna-fishing nations hammered out a temporary plan to stop overfishing of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna, but fatal weaknesses may sink it, experts say. The highly prized yellowfin stock is a few years from collapse, scientists warn.

Summary of [original article](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/06/watered-down-plan-to-save-india-ocean-yellowfin-tuna-disappoints-conservationists/):

> Highly contentious negotiations this month over Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna catches have led to the adoption of an interim plan proposed by the Maldives, a major tuna fishing nation. Tuna-fishing nations hammered out a temporary plan to stop overfishing of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna at a June meeting, but fatal weaknesses may sink it, experts say. "The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission's inability to come to an agreement on a sufficient reduction in yellowfin tuna catch levels isn't new, but it is particularly disappointing that the Commission failed again this year, given its market is now at stake," said Glen Holmes from U.S. NGO the Pew Charitable Trusts.

> I know this is unpopular, but as consumers we should boycott tuna until they've found a sustainable solution.

> In Iran we don't really have elections. We don't really have a democracy. It's democracy within someone's head. Khamenei basically decides who gets to run and who doesn't  and this time around he didn't even let reformists or anyone like Rouhani (current president) run. 
> 
> So we all boycotted the election. I personally don't know a single person who voted out of hundreds of people that I know. Khamenei  does whatever the fuck he wants so why give him th satisfaction of saying "this many people voted for this regime"
> 
> the polling stations all around Tehran were empty today and this will be th lowest turnout ever. 
> 
> There is a part of me scare what will happen with Raeisi as the president but we're so tired that no one really gives a shit anymore.
