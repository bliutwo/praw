Summary of [original article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Asians-dump-WhatsApp-for-Signal-and-Telegram-on-privacy-concerns):

Signal is supported by donations, including a $50 million loan from its co-founder Brian Acton, who also helped create WhatsApp and has long been an advocate for data privacy.

## Fisheries minister did not read Brexit bill as she was busy at nativity

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/13/fisheries-minister-admits-not-reading-brexit-bill-as-she-was-at-nativity?CMP=fb_gu&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR3Gdqpk7eRzti-x5Z3IcVFHMc07je9Yfrb-myZqSLcHI1FJUklbEeUwI3I#Echobox=1610608284):

> Downing Street has said Boris Johnson maintains confidence in the fisheries minister after she admitted not reading the post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels when it was agreed because she was busy organising a nativity trail. Victoria Prentis faced calls for her to quit after the comments, but the prime minister is standing by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister. The SNP's Brexit spokesperson, Philippa Whitford, said: "Due to Brexit-induced bureaucracy, Scotland's fishing communities are already experiencing severe disruption and cannot get their produce to their customers in the EU market on time."For the Tory government's fisheries minister to then admit that she did not even bother to read the details of the damaging deal because she was too busy is unbelievable and makes her position untenable.

> The fact that she's organizing Nativity activities despite having a real job to attend to tells you everything you need to know about her.

In total, over five years, BofA said the capital outflow from Hong Kong could reach HK$588 billion.
