> Now if only the rest of the Muslim world could think the same way. The fact that someone gets pissed off at a French cartoon and doesn't bat an eye at millions of their own getting sent to internment camps boggles my fucking mind.

## UK accuses China of stripping Hong Kong of basic rights and breaking international treaty

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hong-kong-china-uk-raab-rights-wong-treaty-b1760305.html):

> The Chinese government is forcing Hong Kong into a dark and uncertain future by systematically stripping its people of basic political, economic and cultural rights, a report by the Foreign Office in London has charged. "The UK accuses the Chinese government of trying to impose its will on Hong Kong through draconian laws. Mr Raab says in the document that"the chilling effects of the national security law can already be seen in Hong Kong. "The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation would curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous", a joint statement by the UK, US, Australian and Canadian governments said in May of this year.

## BBC News: Oxford University vaccine shows 70% protection

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55040635):

> "The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by [the virus]," said the vaccine's architect Prof Sarah Gilbert. There were 30 cases of Covid in people who had two doses of the vaccine and 101 cases in people who received a dummy injection. Nothing can happen until the vaccine has been approved by regulators who will assess the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, and that it is manufactured to high standard.

`/u/RGrimes12` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jzcz94/bbc_news_oxford_university_vaccine_shows_70/):

> A lot of people are missing the big picture. 0 people who received the vaccine had severe covid or were hospitalized. Even if its only 60% effective at fully preventing, if it legitimately takes away the severity of the virus its game changing.

Summary of [original article](https://www.clickondetroit.com/health/good-health/2020/11/18/studies-reveal-alarming-trends-of-anxiety-depression-among-young-adults-during-covid-19-pandemic/):

> Experts have uncovered alarming trends regarding anxiety and depression among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young adults might not be quite as susceptible to the serious adverse medical effects of COVID-19, but they aren't protected from the stress and anxiety of the pandemic. That study found that an alarming 80% of young adults reported significant depressive symptoms, 80% reported drinking alcohol and 30% reported harmful levels of drinking.

`/u/asdfafdsg` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jz8thc/studies_reveal_alarming_trends_of_anxiety/):

> We're not depressed because of fucking lockdowns, we're depressed because our institutions have failed us on every level. All they've done is show how threadbare the social safety net is and that corporate profits in this country come before public health always.
> 
> Meanwhile bootlickers who use these types of reports to justify anti-science narratives completely miss the point that our government could have, and should have done a lot more to help working class people, instead of funding corporate handouts with taxpayer money and helping the rich get richer.
