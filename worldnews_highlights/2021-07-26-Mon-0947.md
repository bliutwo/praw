Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-doses-pfizer-astrazeneca-shots-effective-against-delta-variant-study-finds-2021-07-21/):

> LONDON, July 21 - Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine are nearly as effective against the highly transmissible Delta coronavirus variant as they are against the previously dominant Alpha variant, a study published on Wednesday showed. Wednesday's study found that two doses of Pfizer's shot was 88% effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, compared to 93.7% against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as previously reported. Two shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective against the Delta variant, up from 60% originally reported, and 74.5% effective against the Alpha variant, compared to an original estimate of 66% effectiveness.

> The 2021 global Gallup report ranked countries in terms of both positive and negative emotions-including sadness, enjoyment, smiling and feelings of respect. "In 2020, the world was a sadder, angrier, more worried and more stressed-out place than it has been at any time in the past 15 years," the Gallup poll organizers wrote in the full survey released Friday. Negative experiences cumulatively hit their highest level since Gallup began the emotions report, with about one-third, or 32 percent, of people expressing feelings of stress, worry, anger or sadness.
