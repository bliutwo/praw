## Dictatorâ€™s Gun-Toting Son, 15, Is Being Groomed as Belarusâ€™ King Joffrey

Summary of [original article](https://us.yahoo.com/news/dictator-gun-toting-son-15-084935086.html):

> This week, Nikolay Lukashenko, the youngest son of the "Last dictator in Europe," came of age during the worst period of his father's reign. With his heavily armed son waiting in the wings, even the death of Lukashenko may not signal the end of Europe's only surviving autocracy west of Moscow. His mother has been erased from public life- Lukashenko explained to the nation that his son was "From God"-and an ex-wife was also sidelined.

> Fucking dictator dynasties. Rise up and fuck these people off. They have no right  legitimacy, mandate or superpowers. Just bullies.

## Hong Kong police accused of 'altering history and erasing facts' in account of last year's Yuen Long mob attack

Summary of [original article](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/08/26/hong-kong-police-accused-of-altering-history-and-erasing-facts-in-account-of-last-years-yuen-long-mob-attack/):

> Hong Kong police have dismissed claims that they colluded with criminal gangs during the Yuen Long mob attacks last year. "A year from the Yuen Long July 21 incident, most Hongkongers understood from live-streams that white-clad rioters indiscriminately attacked civilians. Police officers of all ranks turned a blind eye to the attack and - worse - rolled down the gate of the police station and allowed the white-clad rioters to rage in Yuen Long. Police-triad collusion is known to everyone." "The police force use all kinds of arbitrary arrests to cover up their cowardice and shame in order to rationalise themselves. They altered history and erased facts so as to change public opinions, boost the force's morale and comfort themselves," the statement read.

> The narrative is slowly being changed by the authorities. Archive every event, every milestone so that the people don't forget the truth.
> 
> A year ago, it was a mob attack on locals by white-clothed thugs. Now it's said to be an evenly matched brawl between warring factions. A year ago, law enforcement was seen chumming it up with the assailants. Now it's the police dispersing the mob. A year ago, Lam Cheuk-ting was lauded as a responsible citizen reporting a traumatic incident. Now he's being accused of rioting in the very same incident.
> 
> Never forget the cowardice and corruption witnessed on that day.

> Whatever little time she has on the phone, Nimisha has been trying her best to call her relatives in India, desperate for help, as she has been given the death penalty by a court in Yemen. Nimisha and her husband Tomy."I went back to Kerala with my child towards the end of the year. In a month or two, Nimisha and I discussed starting a small clinic in Yemen. At that time we were told that we will need the help of a Yemeni citizen to process the license, and Nimisha suggested Talal's name. We had gone to his clothes shop once and I vaguely remembered him," her husband Tomy, who now lives in Ernakulam, tells TNM.But eventually, Nimisha did not take Talal's help for the license. Her mother Prema Kumari, who works as a house help in Ernakulam, and her husband, are continuing to knock on doors to find some way to help Nimisha.

> So from the article headline alone, you would think itâ€™s some typical maid story, but itâ€™s about a foreign woman who was forcibly unable to leave the country because of an asshole who told everyone sheâ€™s his wife and faked a marriage certificate. I implore those who see this to read it, and hope that someone who can help will find a way. I can feel the frustration just reading this. The wife has a husband back in India trying to help but theyâ€™re out of money.
> 
> Edit: Surprised by the number of people who still comment without reading the article. This article isnâ€™t about slavery or maids in the Middle East subjected to horrible treatment. Those problems exist but stop using this particular womanâ€™s *unrelated* misery to push your own narrative. 
> 
> And yes, the news source might make the article biased and the murder may have been premeditated, but this woman deserves a lawyer and trial at least.
