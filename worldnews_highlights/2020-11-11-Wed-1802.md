> I think this is the key statement in the article. Unlike Trump's refuted claims that the US put money towards the vaccine, the company acknowledges that Germany/The EU **actually did**. And they are willing to take this into account when selling.

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/10/british-companies-will-forced-reveal-sources-raw-materials-new/):

> British companies will be forced to reveal the sources of their raw materials under new laws to clamp down on deforestation, the government has revealed. Sourcing materials in a way which illegally degrades the environment abroad will be made illegal under the Environment Bill, ministers announced, in response to a government consultation. According to a new government report, 80 per cent of deforestation is linked to the expansion of agriculture, with land being cleared to make way for grazing animals and to grow crops.

## Jair Bolsonaro asks Brazilians not to deal with Covid-19 'like f*gs'

Summary of [original article](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/jair-bolsonaro-asks-brazilians-not-to-deal-with-covid-19-like-fags-914199.html#):

> President Jair Bolsonaro drew criticism Tuesday for telling Brazilians not to deal with Covid-19 like "a country of fags," the far-right leader's latest controversial outburst on the pandemic. "All anyone talks about these days is the pandemic. We need to stop that," said Bolsonaro during the speech, which was ostensibly on tourism. CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH. "Recently, a big-shot presidential candidate said if I didn't put out the wildfires in the Amazon he would impose trade sanctions on Brazil," Bolsonaro said, apparently referring to a comment Biden made during his first debate with Trump in September.

## Deutsche Bank proposes a 5% 'privilege' tax on people working from home

`/u/Still_Mighty` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jsc8rr/deutsche_bank_proposes_a_5_privilege_tax_on/):

> > "The $48 billion raised could pay for a $1,500 grant to the 29 million workers who cannot work from home and earn under $30,000 a year," he said.
> 
> It *could* pay for a grant but we all know it fucking *won’t*.
> 
> Edited to add: why is it considered a privilege to now work from home if it turns out your job was always capable of being fully remote? This pandemic exposed so many problems with the workforce that are now being solved as a way to deal with the crisis. It’s brought on a new way of approaching labor for so many industries that now allow people to live in lower cost areas and have a better work-life balance and lessens the number of people on the roads and reduces carbon emissions... these changes feel long overdue. 
> 
> For Deutsche Bank to look at that and complain that people aren’t paying enough for the benefit of the betterment of society at large is mind-bogglingly tone deaf.

## Hong Kong gov't ousts four democratically-elected lawmakers from legislature

Summary of [original article](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/11/11/breaking-hong-kong-govt-ousts-four-democratically-elected-lawmakers-from-legislature/):

> The Hong Kong government has disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers after China's top legislative body passed a resolution to oust legislators who promote or support Hong Kong independence. It came after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a resolution on Wednesday stating that Hong Kong lawmakers who promote or support Hong Kong independence and refuse to admit China's exercise of sovereignty over the city would be deemed as not fulfilling the requirement of swearing allegiance to the SAR. Those who appeal to foreign or overseas forces to interfere with Hong Kong's affairs and those who engage in behaviour endangering national security would not meet the loyalty requirement as well, the ruling said. The Hong Kong authorities said Beijing's decision is applicable to those who were barred from running in the now-delayed 2020 Legislative Council election: "Once confirmed in accordance to the law, [they] would lose their Legislative Council member qualification immediately," the government said in a statement.

`/u/Acrzyguy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/js277e/hong_kong_govt_ousts_four_democraticallyelected/):

> With pro-democracy legislators no longer accounting for one-third of the lawmakers, the final straw of democracy in the legislation of Hong Kong has been destroyed. Now all sensible people can look through the facade China and the puppet-government of Hong Kong have kept for years.
