## Underage girl forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, US court document claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/31/underage-girl-forced-to-have-sex-with-prince-andrew-us-court-document-jeffrey-epstein):

> The sex offender Jeffrey Epstein allegedly tried to gather incriminating material against Prince Andrew by forcing an underage girl to have sex with him, according to newly released court documents. A friend of Prince Andrew said: "The US federal appeals court said in 2019 these allegations should be treated with 'extreme caution'. Allegations are not the same as facts, which is the essential premise on which justice works. Let's see if these allegations stand up, because precious few about the duke do - where's the proof?". Similar allegations about Prince Andrew having sex with an underage girl were ordered to be struck from court records in 2015 in the civil case.

> why is it so hard for the titles to say "Prince Andrew raped underage girl"?
> 
> EDIT: Because I am being accused of libel for saying this, let me clarify my proposed statement/title for this article: "Prince Andrew accused of RAPING A CHILD". Factually the truth based on court documents where he is literally accused of raping a child.

## Germany to ban single use plastics by 2021

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleantechexpress.com/2020/07/germany-to-ban-single-use-plastics-by.html?m=1):

> When Germany does manage to ban these products for good, items like food containers, cotton buds, plastic straws, and others will be a thing of the past. People using products through single-use plastics should be more responsible and take initiatives to refrain from using them as that would reduce the dependence on single-use plastic products. The discovery of microscopic plastic particles inside birds, aquatic animals, and others even in faraway places means the extent of pollution due to discarded plastic materials is huge and the need to tighten their usage or even completely banning them was felt acutely in many countries, including Germany.

`/u/yadoga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i15tji/germany_to_ban_single_use_plastics_by_2021/):

> Reminder that only 16% of the world's plastic is recycled. The vast majority of plastics remains in the environment as waste, collected in landfills at best. Plastic is everywhere. And it's still increasingly ending up where it doesn't belong: In the stomach of fish and other animals and therefore.. in most of us. We can try harder to avoid plastic altogether, wherever possible.
> 
> Edit:
> 
> So after some more digging, it seems to be regarding only consumer goods: Plastic straws, plates, knives, forks etc. As pointed out by others in this thread, too. That leaves this initiative as nothing more than a nice gesture. Especially when considering the overwhelming majority (97%) of single use plastics is used by industry as pointed out here by /u/BatJew_Official as well.
> 
> 
> This is also not a Germany-only regulation: The EU is planning on banning single-use plastics in all member states from summer 2021. Again, only planned for consumer goods. IMHO this is just a tiny step forward. We need bolder regulation and higher taxes on plastics to achieve anything meaningful in a timeframe that can still help us move forward.
> 
> Edit2:
> 
> Policy is lagging / too often closely tied to industry interests. (Water is wet). We need to vote with our wallets..

> One in four positive cases of COVID-19 in Victoria were not at home when health authorities check in on them, prompting fears of the outbreak spreading. More than 100 positive cases of COVID-19 who were not self-isolating at home will now be followed up by Victoria Police.

## Irish citizens win case to force government action on climate change | Living

`/u/dubstar2000` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i169uk/irish_citizens_win_case_to_force_government/):

> Per capita we're actually pretty heavy polluters, a lot of it down to our massive beef/dairy export industry. We export something like 90% of the beef and dairy produced, and with all the land being used for cattle there's no wilderness in the country, and we have the lowest forest coverage in Europe apart from the speck in the med that is Malta. 
> 
> Lots of Irish people think there's no point in us complying with the Paris Agreement etc because we can't make any difference as we are a small nation. But in a globalised world facing a global problem everyone has to chip in, and we should be setting examples for other countries.  
> I would be more concerned about our biodiversity crisis though, farming and pesticides and terrible policies have meant there's nearly nothing left of nature in the country, our uplands are sheepwrecked hills like something on the moon when they should be covered in forest.   
> Hopefully the greens in government will help, but I think people in Ireland see green fields covered in pesticide to feed cows and think we're a very green country when we're far from it.

## How Costa Rica Slowed, Stopped, Then Reversed, Deforestation in Their Rainforests

Summary of [original article](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/costa-rica-slows-stops-and-reverses-deforestation/):

> In the 1970s and 80s, Costa Rica had the highest deforestation rates in Latin America-but the next few decades saw the country halt her forest loss, initiate replanting and conservation efforts, and regrow almost all of her lost tree cover. Now 60% of the country is forested once again, and every year, the Costa Rican Forest Fund collects $33 million which it uses to make sure the forests of Costa Rica which sit on privately-owned land are taken care of. Costa Rica's PES system has been adopted by other nations across the world in recognition of its success-notably Rwanda, whose commitment to restoring its natural forest ecosystems saw them sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Costa Rica in 2019.

`/u/SerfnTurf` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i16x7r/how_costa_rica_slowed_stopped_then_reversed/):

> Yes! They account for I believe 5% of the entire world's biodiverdity, which is a lot for its size.
> 
> The biggest issue I have noticed traveling there often with students and speaking with locals is that they are still trimming grass and shrubbery quite a bit by the roads. This is becoming an issue for a multitude of reasons from deteriorating support for the flora and fauna, to preventing landslides, which happen often already during the wet season. Other than that they have done an AMAZING job of preserving their biodiversity.
> 
> They also abolished their army and put money towards education instead. They have something like a 99% literacy rate. Costa Rica is a cool place and the locals are amazing. Â¡Pura vida!

## Hong Kong postpones election as coronavirus cases surge

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/hong-kong-delays-legislative-council-elections-as-coronavirus-cases-surge.html):

> Hong Kong's legislative council election will be postponed, the city's leader Carrie Lam announced Friday amid a new surge in coronavirus cases. The postponement of the election came after Hong Kong authorities announced Thursday that 12 pro-democracy nominees have been disqualified from running in the upcoming elections. According to Hong Kong law, an election can be postponed if the city's chief executive believes it is likely to be "Obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by riot or open violence or any danger to public health and safety." Voting typically has to take place within 14 days of the original date, but the city's leader also has power to make regulations when there are "Occasions of emergency or public danger."

`/u/boycottchinazi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i1545w/hong_kong_postpones_election_as_coronavirus_cases/):

> Many countries, like South Korea, have held successful elections with much higher infection numbers without any new cases related to the election.
> 
> wear masks  
> wear gloves  
> line up with 2m distance from each other  
> extend voting timeslots  
> different booth for sick people  
> temperature check  
> The solutions are present but the gov chose to ignore them, The whole thing is a political move to suppress the opposition.
