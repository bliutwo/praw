Summary of [original article](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40298573.html):

> Ireland is set to become the first EU country to recognise the Israeli settlement in Palestinian territory as annexation when the Dáil votes on a motion tomorrow. Cross-party motion 'blocked by SF'.Speaking during a debate on a motion brought forward by Sinn Féin, Mr Coveney said the Government had worked with the opposition to come up with a cross-party motion on the matter. A Government amendment to include a condemnation of the actions of Hamas passed the Dáil tonight, paving the way for a passing of the main motion recognising annexation tomorrow afternoon.

On Monday, a video of Protasevich was released on social media in which he claimed to be in good health and admitted he was behind "Civil disturbances" in Belarus.

## ‘We don’t have time’: scientists urge B.C. to immediately defer logging in key old-growth forests amid arrests

Summary of [original article](https://thenarwhal.ca/bc-old-growth-forest-deferrals-scientists-2021/):

> B.C.'s rarest forest ecosystems are rapidly disappearing and if the province doesn't act immediately to defer logging in key areas, as recommended by the 2020 Old Growth Strategic Review, they will be lost forever, according to a report released Wednesday by a team of independent scientists. The analysis of B.C.'s remaining old growth forests and mapping tools aims to help the province meet the recommendations of the old-growth panel. The review recommended the province defer development in old forests with a high risk of irreversible biodiversity loss.

`/u/neosituation_unknown` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nku1zd/we_dont_have_time_scientists_urge_bc_to/):

> This is just absolutely ridiculous the way we use our natural resources.
> 
> If we manage forests properly, we can harvest one area, replant it, and come back in 50 years and harvest again. Repeat forever and you have unlimited and never ending forest products as long as trees grow.
> 
> No need to harm protected and sensitive areas.
> 
> Sir David Attenborough, the famed naturalist, had the same thought in regards to fishing.
> 
> Designate certian areas as protected breeding zones for fish. No fishing whatsoever. Fish will then migrate to areas where fishing is allowed.
> 
> Boom. Unlimited fish for ever.
> 
> It is shocking that a developed country like Canada allows this crap

## Soldier who called on troops to refuse vaccine distribution faces mutiny related charge

Summary of [original article](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/soldier-who-called-on-troops-to-refuse-vaccine-distribution-faces-mutiny-related-charge):

> A soldier who called on his fellow military personnel to refuse helping with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been charged with an offence related to mutiny. Kenderesi, who had a civilian hunting knife strapped to his Canadian Forces uniform and was carrying a non-Canadian helmet, questioned the safety of the vaccine. Ottawa lawyer Michel Drapeau said the laying of a charge related to mutiny is unheard of in the Canadian Forces in modern times.

## Coronavirus: Influencers offered money to badmouth Pfizer vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/05/coronavirus-influencers-offered-money-to-badmouth-pfizer-vaccine.html):

> Several French social media influencers say they have been approached by a communications agency which offered them money to spread negative publicity about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a ploy the health minister described as dangerous and irresponsible. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech last November became the first drug manufacturers to report successful initial data from a large coronavirus vaccine clinical trial. One of the operators of 'Et ca se dit medecin', which has about 30,000 followers on Twitter and 90,000 on Instagram, also said on RMC TV he had been offered money to discredit the Pfizer vaccine.

`/u/bombayblue` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nl0qta/coronavirus_influencers_offered_money_to_badmouth/):

> Paid by Russia. Don’t forget that.

## EU locks out Belarus from international aviation

Summary of [original article](https://euobserver.com/world/151927):

> EU leaders have agreed a first wave of economic sanctions against Belarus over Sunday's hijacking and said there were more to come. The EU "Calls on all EU-based carriers to avoid overflight of Belarus" and will "Ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines", leaders said in a joint statement after meeting in Brussels on Monday. Speculation was rife among EU diplomats on whether Russia had had a hand in the Belarus fiasco.

`/u/European_Unity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nklqqs/eu_locks_out_belarus_from_international_aviation/):

> This is very serious response from the EU and should severely cripple Belarus. Their airline is effectively dead and will no longer generate income for their state. This is much more severe than the usual sanction we see coming from the EU. I think it's a good signal showing you can't simply divert planes with fake bomb threats and military coercion.
