## The pesticide that caused bee colonies to collapse is killing birds now

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/18/the-pesticide-that-caused-bee-colonies-to-collapse-is-killing-birds-now/):

> Because birds can ingest neonicotinoids when they eat crop seeds or aquatic or emergent insects, there appears to be a correlation between consuming the pesticide and a decline in some bird populations. Taking account of that, they find that "The average annual effect of neonicotinoids on grassland birds is 12% and on insectivorous birds is 5%.". Last year researchers at the University of Saskatchewan found that the pesticide imidacloprid, which is also a neonicotinoid, had a negative impact on the ability of migrating birds to lead healthy lives and successfully reproduce.

## Manafort shared campaign info with Russian intelligence officer, Senate panel finds

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/512526-manafort-shared-campaign-info-with-russian-intelligence-officer):

> Former Trump campaign manager had deep ties to a Russian intelligence officer and secretly shared campaign information, according to a sweeping Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday. "The Committee found that Manafort's presence on the Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for the Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump Campaign. The Committee assesses that Kilimnik likely served as a channel to Manafort for Russian intelligence services, and that those services likely sought to exploit Manafort's access to gain insight [into] the Campaign," the committee found. ADVERTISEMENT. The decision by the Senate Intelligence Committee to identify Kilimnik as a Russian intelligence officer goes a step further than former special counsel , who identified Kilimnik as an individual the FBI assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence but did not call him an intelligence agent.

> Russians operated Wikileaks, Stone worked with Wikileaks. Manafort was working with Kilimnick. This was all happening with the knowledge of, and at the direction, of the campaign, which included the Trump family and Trump.
> 
> Normal people would think of this as "collusion"

## New Zealand Lawmakers Are Hitting Back At Trump For His Comments About Their Coronavirus Cases On Monday, the US recorded almost 38,000 new cases of COVID-19. New Zealand recorded just nine.

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/jacinda-ardern-hit-back-trump-coronavirus-new-zealand):

> Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and other New Zealand lawmakers are hitting back at President Donald Trump in unusually blunt terms over his comments comparing the coronavirus outbreak there to the US. "Obviously it's patently wrong," Ardern told reporters on Tuesday in response to Trump saying there had been a "Huge surge" in her country. According to public broadcaster Radio New Zealand, there are currently 90 active cases of the virus in all of New Zealand, which has a total population of 4.8 million people. New Zealand politicians called Trump out, saying it was not fair or accurate to compare their number of new cases - nine on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, according to Radio New Zealand - with the US. "Obviously I don't think there's any comparisons between New Zealand's current cluster and the tens of thousands of cases that are being seen daily in the United States," said Ardern.

> As a Kiwi, please don’t even engage him. He’s the fat loser sitting in the corner taking pot shots a those who are achieving something, because he’s feeling left out, jealous and bitter. The only reason he speaks is to get a response that will be printed somewhere.
> 
> Ignore him, keeping doing the great work being done. He’s not worth even thinking about.
