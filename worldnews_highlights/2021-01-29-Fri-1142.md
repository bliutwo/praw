> Don’t forget locked down colleges still charging for campus amenities like gyms, parking, and library use
> 
> Edit*  some have brought forth the idea that I may have added library use unfairly. I am willing to concede that perhaps library use should be struck from this post. As it  could be stated that some colleges could have their librarians running around a doing backend work. This is fair. 
> 
>  I want to state publicly I adore libraries and fully support them.  I am speaking specifically to charges involved in being able to go into the library on campus to use it to study. 
> 
> Also I want to say to some of you that talk about databases and online materials through the campus library. I still have friends in college that are being charged for library use fees ( physical usage) and technology fees where the tech fees are for campus database search and online library (ebook) fees.  This is the meat of my complaint toward library fees.

> I really want to stress the point of nineteen eighty four is to show how words like patriot and freedom have become corrupted. Orwell wanted to describe a world so terrible it could never exist to stress how this was happening to us and how bad it really was. This just ~60 years ago was a horror of incredible proportions that it is ingrained in our culture just because of the sheer magnitude of horror. China has made an entire country that looks just like this and it really exists. It’s starting to propagate everywhere else too.

## China says it will no longer recognise British passport for Hong Kong residents

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-hong-kong-british-passport-bno-b1794566.html):

> China has said it will not recognise the British National Overseas passport as a valid document for Hong Kong residents from Sunday, after the UK said it would allow it to be used as a route to British citizenship. "The British side's attempt to turn a large number of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens has completely changed the nature of the two sides' original understanding of BNO. This move seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations," Mr Zhao told reporters. "The British side, in breach of its promise, has chosen to obstinately and repeatedly hype up the BNO passport issue to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs. This will only end up hurting its own interests."

> All bark and no bite. 
> 
> BNO passports are only relevant to the UK. HKers can still leave Chinese borders with their HKID cards and HKSAR passports.
> 
> If they said they no longer recognise HKID cards or HKSAR passports then that would actually do something...
