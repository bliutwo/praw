Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/thousands-protest-against-netanyahu-in-final-pre-election-demonstration/):

> In a final mass protest before the March 23 elections, thousands of demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem on Saturday evening to call for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. At its peak in mid-summer, the anti-Netanyahu protests saw tens of thousands take to the streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with thousands more carrying black flags and protest signs on bridges and intersections across the country. Who protested against Netanyahu for years, there would be no alternative except to continue demonstrating in the event of a Netanyahu victory.

## Japan's Intellectual Property High Court ruled on March 18 that performances by students in lessons at music schools are not subject to fees from Japan's music copyright body, in a modification of a February 2020 ruling that stated teachers and students' playing was chargeable.

Summary of [original article](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210320/p2a/00m/0na/004000c):

> TOKYO - Japan's Intellectual Property High Court ruled on March 18 that performances by students in lessons at music schools are not subject to fees from Japan's music copyright body, in a modification of a February 2020 ruling that stated teachers and students' playing was chargeable. With consideration for Japan's Copyright Act allowing the collection of fees on music played publicly, the high court decided students' performances are not for public consumption because they play to be heard by specific teachers. From a music schools' perspective, the students are the public, and teachers' performances are for public consumption, so the court said teachers are subject to copyright fees as ruled in the first trial.

> I am all for artists making money from their music, including for those who doing live performance makes no or less sense, but IP law around music has become incredibly stupid. The amount of years to make money from some musical and timbral string of notes should be severely restricted to a few years tops (5-10 years) with more fair use.

## Revealed: the grim list of sex abuse claims against Metropolitan police | Metropolitan police | The Guardian

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/20/revealed-the-grim-list-of-sex-abuse-claims-against-metropolitan-police?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Firefox_Beta):

> An extraordinary catalogue of sexual misconduct allegations against Metropolitan police officers, including claims that one had sex with a rape victim and another assaulted a domestic abuse survivor, are revealed in documents obtained by the Observer. The details, disclosed by the Met after the Observer requested information on complaints regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape against officers, community support officers and special constables, emerged from the 594 complaints against Met employees. Figures from the Royal College of Policing's current "Barred list" - officers who have been dismissed from a force and are banned from joining another - show that nearly a fifth of offences include abuse of position for sexual purposes, domestic violence or harassment against the public and colleagues.
