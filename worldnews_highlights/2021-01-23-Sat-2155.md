## Navalny escalates battle with Putin as European officials demand his release

Summary of [original article](https://www.politico.eu/article/imprisoned-alexei-navalny-escalates-battle-with-putin-as-eu-officials-condemn-arrest-and-demand-release/):

> As top EU officials noisily demanded his release but took no concrete action, Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who was immediately arrested upon his return to Moscow after recovering in Germany from an assassination attempt, escalated his battle with President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Posing as a high-ranking security official, Navalny telephoned one of his alleged attackers, and elicited incriminating statements, in what amounted to a humiliating blow to the Federal Security Service, the FSB. In testimony to the European Parliament in November, Navalny had urged the EU not to focus on mid-ranking officers of the special services, but rather on the super-wealthy oligarchs close to Putin, many of whom maintain assets in Europe. Navalny rose to prominence as an anti-corruption crusader, but his battle with Putin has been personal at least since 2014 when Navalny and his brother, Oleg, were convicted on trumped-up fraud charges.

> There's a 2-hour video released a couple of days ago that pretty much unravels the whole Putin clan. I'm rooting for this guy, let's hope he can change Russia. It has English subtitles so give it a [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI&t=2s&ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9).

## Jair Bolsonaro could face charges in The Hague over Amazon rainforest

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/jair-bolsonaro-could-face-charges-in-the-hague-over-amazon-rainforest):

> Jair Bolsonaro could face charges in the international criminal court after being accused of crimes against humanity. Indigenous leaders in Brazil and human rights groups are urging the court to investigate the Brazilian president over his dismantling of environmental policies and violations of indigenous rights, which they say amount to ecocide. Raoni is renowned for his fight for the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and indigenous culture.

> These people never get what they deserve. If he does, it's because he doesn't have as much power as other country leaders. Remember, if there's people illegally taking wood,farmers with cattle and soil, is because someone is buying
> 
> Edit:putting it right here so people can read it. I know it's a tough time for everyone, to be seeing a dark future ahead. Indeed, we are not fighting between saving nature or having a rough time, we are fighting between "stop the destruction and minimize the damage" and "ready the ships to mars by 2120". Here's how you can help to save your community/city: talk about it to your peers, use your profession for something good, and organize protests. "Uhhh but that won't save the world, companies are to blame", indeed, but your local fish will probably die out of intense fishing before climate change, so fight for what you can fight(in this case, preserving mangrooves). For the ones who want to be politicians, there ain't no bigger moral obligation than the survival of all life we know. Everytime you do something, ask yourself "how can i help the ecosystem with this" or at least "will this be harmful?"

## Scottish nationalists lay groundwork for second independence referendum

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-scotland-idUSKBN29S0MO):

> 2 Min Read.LONDON - The Scottish National Party published a "Roadmap to Referendum" on Saturday, laying out plans for another vote on Scottish independence just as the United Kingdom grapples with COVID-19 and the impact of Brexit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, argues there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.But the SNP has said that if it wins a parliamentary majority at elections scheduled for May 6, it will pass its own bill so that a referendum can take place once the pandemic is over. "Such a legal challenge would be vigorously opposed by an SNP Scottish government," said the document, dated Jan. 24.Polls show that Scottish nationalists are on course to win a record majority in elections for Scotland's devolved parliament.
