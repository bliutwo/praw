"The ABF website declares that people travelling to or entering Australia must not bring in anything constituting"illegal pornography"-that being defined as "child pornography" as well as the fairly broad and nondescript catchall of "publications, films, computer games and any other goods that describe, depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence, terrorist acts or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults are not allowed. Consumers can still be charged and prosecuted for possessing cartoon hentai if authorities decide it fits the definition of child exploitation material.

Summary of [original article](https://pledgetimes.com/in-russia-doctors-were-banned-from-publicly-commenting-on-the-situation-with-the-coronavirus/):

> In Russia, where a book with "Anti-coronavirus" prayers recently went on sale, doctors were forbidden to publicly comment on the situation with COVID-19 without the consent of the Ministry of Health.

They say that currently the information agenda around the coronavirus is overloaded, including with little useful facts. Earlier, RosSMI reported about scandals due to overcrowding of hospitals with bodies of those who died from coronavirus infection, which have nowhere to store.
