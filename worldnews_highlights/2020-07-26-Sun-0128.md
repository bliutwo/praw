> > The Ecuadorian Navy has identified some 260 vessels in the vicinity of the Galapagos Islands’ exclusive ecological and economic zone.

> What the f\*&#. Is China intent on raiding the world's oceans of any and all life? Two hundred and sixty. Count it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. And that's just 5% of this armada out there. Five f\*&#ing percent. Each one being a fully-equipped fishing ship, with a crew and nets. How many fishing ships does one country need to have *in a single area*.

> This is no mere fishing expedition. It's a f*&#ing invasion.
> 
> > Chinese fishing vessels appear each year near the Galapagos, attracted by marine species such as the hammerhead shark, which is in danger of extinction.
> 
> Why the f*&# are Chinese fishing vessels trying to catch endangered species? Normal sea food, like salmon, shrimp, and tuna, is abundant. There are these things called aquaculture farms, that allow you to cultivate fish on land, without depleting the oceans that are the shared heritage of mankind.

## Tens of Thousands in Russia Challenge the Kremlin in Second Week of Protests

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5871766/protests-russia-governor-arrest/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+time%2Ftopstories+%28TIME%3A+Top+Stories%29):

> Tens of thousands of people marched Saturday across the Russian city of Khabarovsk on the border with China to protest the arrest of the regional governor on murder charges, continuing a wave of protests that has lasted for two weeks in a challenge to the Kremlin. Protesters in Khabarovsk see the charges against Furgal as unsubstantiated and demand that he stand trial at home. "We want to protect Furgal," said Evgenia Selina, who joined Saturday's protest.

`/u/Rice_Krispie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxnrfo/tens_of_thousands_in_russia_challenge_the_kremlin/):

> Russian authorities haven’t quelled this protest because they expected it to fizzle out. It’s nice to see that it’s still strong and the larger the movement gets the more difficult it will be to stop. Furgal, the governor in this locality, is incredibly popular within Khabarovsk and was falsely imprisoned by Putin. However, this protest won’t move the needle much countrywide. The protest is largely localized to just Khabarovsk, I’d love to see it gain traction in other cities as well.

## Israel Bans "Gay conversion" therapy

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53511329?at_custom2=facebook_page&at_custom3=BBC+News&at_custom4=70BD8A48-CCCD-11EA-B70C-FDB096E8478F&at_medium=custom7&at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&at_campaign=64):

> Israeli MPs have taken steps to outlaw the practice of "Gay conversion" therapy by psychologists - the first Middle East country to do so. A bill passed its first stage in parliament, after two parties in the coalition government joined the opposition to vote in favour. The country has a record number of openly gay MPs and last year appointed its first openly gay minister.

`/u/ScumBunnyEx` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxph6k/israel_bans_gay_conversion_therapy/):

> Clarification: the bill to ban gay conversion therapy only passed it's first stage vote. The chances of it passing the second and third stages are not great.
> 
> See, voting for the law on the first stage was a political show of force by the Blue and White party against their Likud coalition members (after the Likud tried to push through a law against the Israeli courts in violation of coalition agreements).
> 
> This move however irked all the ultra-orthodox coalition members, and neither Likud nor Blue and White want them do drop out of the coalition as that would mean going to elections again when public approval for the government is at an all time low.
> 
> Which means the odds that Blue and White or any of their coalition partners vote in favor of the law again on the second and third stages is pretty low, and considering some of the opposition parties (like the religious elements of the Joint Arab List) oppose the law as well it's going to be hard for it to pass the next stages and become a full fledged law.

## Black Lives Matter rally in Sydney ruled a prohibited public assembly

Summary of [original article](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/black-lives-matter-rally-in-sydney-ruled-a-prohibited-public-assembly?cid=newsapp:socialshare:copylink):

> A Sydney Black Lives Matters rally has lost its status as an authorised assembly, opening up demonstrators to arrest and fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions on mass gatherings. The NSW Supreme Court on Sunday sided with police and dubbed the event a prohibited public assembly. 23 July: Black Lives Matter protesters defend protest plans at Supreme Court.

`/u/Feignedremorse` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxzrwx/black_lives_matter_rally_in_sydney_ruled_a/):

> Can we please be reasonable about this. It was prohibited due to Covid19, not because those in power want to supress the social issue.
> 
> I know it's tempting and easy to spin this into an act of suppression but it was simply done to protect the public from medical harm.

## Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1957399/vietnam-sees-first-covid-case-in-100-days):

> HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease. "Patient 416" is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16. Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.

`/u/gabonthegreat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxmqa7/vietnam_has_detected_its_first_locally/):

> So did it come from outside the country or was the virus circulating amongst non-tested people for 100 days and was finally detected after a test?

> During a daily briefing, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia and China have developed "Relations of a special partnership", China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
