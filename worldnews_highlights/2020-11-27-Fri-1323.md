## Climate ‘apocalypse’ fears stopping people having children – study

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/27/climate-apocalypse-fears-stopping-people-having-children-study):

> People worried about the climate crisis are deciding not to have children because of fears that their offspring would have to struggle through a climate apocalypse, according to the first academic study of the issue. Previously, opinion polls of the general public indicated people were connecting the climate crisis and reproduction, with one poll in 2020 finding that among 18- to 44-year-old US citizens without children, 14% cited climate change as a "Major reason" for not having children. "Seth Wynes, of Concordia University in Canada, whose 2017 study found having one less child was the greatest impact individuals can have in fighting climate change, said the researchers had properly stressed that the sample was not representative of all Americans. But he said the distress over the decision to have children made sense."Climate change is already affecting our world in frightening ways and so it's certainly reasonable to account for the climate crisis when thinking about the future of one's family.

When Iran entered the 2015 nuclear deal, it denied that such a program existed.

## Just 1% of Farms Control 70% of Global Farmland: Study Finds 'Shocking State of Land Inequality'

Summary of [original article](https://www.ecowatch.com/land-inequality-world-farms-2649043242.html):

> <p>"As we embark on a just recovery from the compound crises of climate disasters, racist police brutality, economic injustice, and Covid-19, we are in a pivotal moment of reckoning that requires us to ground in the history of the United States as a country built on stolen Indigenous land by stolen Black and African labor," Yakupitiyage said. </p><p>"Fossil fuel executives and racist climate criminals continue to assault treaty rights and Indigenous sovereignty, attempting to ram toxic and unnecessary pipelines like Keystone XL, Dakota Access, and Line 3 through sacred Indigenous land and waters, while perpetuating threats and violence against Indigenous womxn, girls, and two-spirit people," said Yakupitiyage. "Our leap toward a just recovery must start with honoring treaties with sovereign Indigenous nations and returning land back to Native peoples. The time is now for meaningful care and repair."</p><p>For months, 350.org has spearheaded global calls for a just recovery from the pandemic - <a href="Https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/30/ahead-may-day-500-groups-worldwide-demand-just-and-visionary-recovery-covid-19" target=" blank">demanding</a> that policymakers prioritize human health, provide economic relief directly to the people, help workers and communities rather than corporate executives, work to create resilience for future crises, and build solidarity across borders.

## Chinese doctors jailed for organ harvesting

Summary of [original article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3111547/chinese-doctors-jailed-organ-harvesting):

> Another doctor Lu Sen, also an organ procurement officer at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital, was responsible for the remaining one. In 2005, former health minister Huang Jiefu publicly acknowledged that China had harvested executed prisoners' organs for transplant. International human rights activists and domestic critics have exposed other cases of organ harvesting, but Beijing has consistently denied the accusations stressing that the voluntary organ donation system has worked well.

`/u/angilinwago4` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k1tmfs/chinese_doctors_jailed_for_organ_harvesting/):

> "Once a suitable candidate had been identified, the doctors then travelled from Nanjing to Huaiyuan county to get the families to sign what they believed were legitimate consent forms.
> 
> The dead patients were then hastily operated on in a delivery van disguised as an ambulance and without the presence of staff from the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) or the patients’ relatives as required under the law.
> 
> According to the World Health Organization, the RCSC has been commissioned by China’s Ministry of Health to run the organ donation system. It also acts as a watchdog to ensure everything is done according to the law."
> 
> I am sure it's the problem of a few rotten apples, but operated on at the back of a delivery van, fuck. You wonder how widespread this is.

> >You think that because we are women we are weak, and that may be true but only up to a point, because even though we have nobody to defend us and we have to work long hours until late into the night to earn a living for our families we can no longer be silent in the face of these acts that enrage us. We were victims of sexual violence from bus drivers working the maquila night shifts here in Juárez, and although a lot of people know about the things we've suffered, nobody defends us nor does anything to protect us. That's why I am an instrument that will take revenge for many women. For we are seen as weak, but in reality we are not. We are brave. And if we don't get respect, we will earn that respect with our own hands. We the women of Juárez are strong.

## Iran accuses Israel after assassination of top nuclear scientist

Summary of [original article](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/11/27/iran-accuses-israel-after-assassination-of-top-nuclear-scientist):

> The killing comes just days before the 10-year anniversary of the killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari, which Tehran also blamed on Israel. A Western diplomat interviewed for a 2014 profile of the nuclear scientist said Fakhrizadeh "Would be known as the father of the Iranian bomb" if Tehran ever pursued nuclear weapons. IAEA inspectors now monitor Iranian nuclear sites as part of Iran's now-unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.
