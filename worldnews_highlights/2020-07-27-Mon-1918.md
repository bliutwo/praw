Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/07/24/trained-dogs-sniffed-out-covid-19-infections-with-high-accuracy-study.html?__twitter_impression=true):

> A new study, which was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, the Hannover Medical School and the German Armed Forces found that, if properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV-2 and non-infected samples with a 94% success rate overall. To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germany's Armed Forces for one week. While more research is still needed, Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to differentiate Covid-19 samples from other diseases like influenza.

> > Taken together, the two studies, published Monday in JAMA Cardiology, suggest that in many patients, Covid-19 could presage heart failure, a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body declines. It is too soon to say if the damage in patients recovering from Covid-19 is transient or permanent, but cardiologists are worried.

> Wow, the health implications for the general public could be enormous if the changes are permanent.

> Animals were subjected to a string of brutal attacks at a farm that sells goats' milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and other supermarkets, footage from hidden cameras has revealed. Goat milk, yoghurts, cheese and ice cream sold by the St Helen's Farm brand are the best-known goat milk products in the UK and are stocked by major supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Ocado. "St Helen's say on their website the milk is a reward for looking after the goats and that their staff have a genuine interest and love for the animals. But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms."

## Philippine Duterte: Face-to-face classes to resume in January 2021. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers

Summary of [original article](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/27/20/duterte-no-face-to-face-classes-until-covid-19-vaccine-is-available):

> MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday said in-person classes would be allowed starting January 21, clarifying earlier statements he made, as the COVID-19 threat remains. Last week, the president approved the Department of Education's proposal to hold limited in-person or face-to-face classes in areas with low risk of COVID-19 transmission. Classes in public schools are scheduled to start on August 24 while private schools are allowed to open earlier upon the approval of the DepEd's regional directors.

> Why does Duterte sometimes seem reasonable and thoughtful and then other times sound completely batshit crazy? There's no middle ground.

## Alarm over discovery of hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels near Galápagos Islands

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/27/chinese-fishing-vessels-galapagos-islands):

> Ecuador has sounded the alarm after its navy discovered a huge fishing fleet of mostly Chinese-flagged vessels some 200 miles from the Galápagos Islands, the archipelago which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the Galápagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this year's fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years. "We were appalled to discover that a massive Chinese industrial fishing fleet is currently off the Galápagos Islands," said John Hourston, a spokesman for the Blue Planet Society, a NGO which campaigns against overfishing.
