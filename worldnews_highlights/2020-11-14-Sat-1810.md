## Jewish-Muslim Biker Gang Protects Jewish Cemetery in Copenhagen From Far-Right Attacks

Summary of [original article](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/11/13/jewish-muslim-biker-gang-protects-jewish-cemetery-in-copenhagen-from-far-right-attacks/):

> A group of Jewish and Muslim bikers came together this week in the Danish capital of Copenhagen to protect a Jewish cemetery in the city from a feared far-right attack. Members of the motorcycle club Muju and Co patrolled the Jewish section of the Vestre Kirkegård in Copenhagen on Monday night - the 82nd anniversary of the Nazi-sanctioned "Reichspogromnacht" that devastated Jewish communities in Germany and Austria with violence and arson. When the anniversary fell in 2019, more than 80 graves in the Jewish section of the cemetery were vandalized by far-right thugs.

`/u/foodbag` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ju6tqs/water_cannon_fired_at_german_antilockdown_rally/):

> This headline is a bit misleading. The police did not use the Water cannon against the "Querdenker" aka anti-lockdown rally at the beginning. They used them against the couinter protesters to clear the way for the anti-lockdown rally. Only later in the day after the anti-lockdown rally was ended by the police and the protesters not complying was the water cannon also used against the Querdenker.

> The article does not mention the second part and only speaks of the usage of the water cannon against the counter protesters.

## Britain to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars just 10 years from now - The Prime Minister is expected to announce that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030, with some experts predicting the change presents a 'monumental challenge' to the car industry

Summary of [original article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/britain-ban-sale-new-petrol-23010157):

> "Ian Plummer, director at Auto Trader, said:"In order to meet the government's new ban of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, the sale of EVs must overtake the sale of traditional ICE cars by 2024. An end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would mark a huge shift in Britain's automotive market. Industry figures show that petrol and diesel powered cars accounted for 73.6% of new car sales so far this year, while just 5.5% of sales were for pure electric vehicles, which are typically more expensive.
