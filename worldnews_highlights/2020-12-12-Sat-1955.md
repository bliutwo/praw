> > The family’s route home was blocked by the Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu nationalist group, who threatened them and called the police. The police arrested Rashid and took Muskan to the shelter home, despite her protesting the couple were happily married.
> 
> > “This is what Muslims do, first they love, and then they carry out Love Jihad after a few months. We know Pinky [Muskan] is seeing love right now, but after a few days she will find it very difficult to live her life,” said Gaurav Bhatnagar, the Bajrang Dal leader from Moradabad.
> 
> This is getting more and more ridiculous. Shouldn't they at least pretend that the woman has been abducted or given drugs or something? What is even the basis for such an accusation? The family of the woman disapproving of the marriage?
> 
> > On Tuesday, the police arrested Haider Ali, a Muslim from the town of Kushinagar, tortured him and threatened to “skin him alive”. Mr Ali was released the next day after it was discovered his bride was born a Muslim.
> 
> Now I'm completely at a loss for words. How does a man who marries a woman that was born to a Muslim family get accused of love jihad? Who even made that accusation? Can't be the woman, can't be the woman's family. Is the law already being used for "swatting" people you don't like with made-up accusations, a bit like the blasphemy law in Pakistan?
