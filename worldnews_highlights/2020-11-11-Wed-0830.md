## Australian parliament to probe Rupert Murdoch’s media dominance

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/11/australian-parliament-to-probe-rupert-murdochs-media-dominance):

> Australia's parliament will launch an inquiry into media ownership, a prominent senator said, after more than half a million people signed a petition demanding a probe into Rupert Murdoch's dominance of the news industry. The online petition attracted a record number of signatories after being launched on October 12 by former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a frequent target of newspapers controlled by Murdoch's News Corp. The Australian arm of the New York-based company is the country's largest media organisation, owning papers in nearly every major city as well as cable television networks and magazines. "We are especially concerned that Australia's print media is overwhelmingly controlled by News Corporation, founded by Fox News billionaire Rupert Murdoch, with around two-thirds of daily newspaper readership."

Summary of [original article](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/jair-bolsonaro-asks-brazilians-not-to-deal-with-covid-19-like-fags-914199.html#):

> President Jair Bolsonaro drew criticism Tuesday for telling Brazilians not to deal with Covid-19 like "a country of fags," the far-right leader's latest controversial outburst on the pandemic.

"Recently, a big-shot presidential candidate said if I didn't put out the wildfires in the Amazon he would impose trade sanctions on Brazil," Bolsonaro said, apparently referring to a comment Biden made during his first debate with Trump in September.

## Hong Kong gov't ousts four democratically-elected lawmakers from legislature

Summary of [original article](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/11/11/breaking-hong-kong-govt-ousts-four-democratically-elected-lawmakers-from-legislature/):

> The Hong Kong government has disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers after China's top legislative body passed a resolution to oust legislators who promote or support Hong Kong independence. It came after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a resolution on Wednesday stating that Hong Kong lawmakers who promote or support Hong Kong independence and refuse to admit China's exercise of sovereignty over the city would be deemed as not fulfilling the requirement of swearing allegiance to the SAR. Those who appeal to foreign or overseas forces to interfere with Hong Kong's affairs and those who engage in behaviour endangering national security would not meet the loyalty requirement as well, the ruling said. The Hong Kong authorities said Beijing's decision is applicable to those who were barred from running in the now-delayed 2020 Legislative Council election: "Once confirmed in accordance to the law, [they] would lose their Legislative Council member qualification immediately," the government said in a statement.

`/u/Acrzyguy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/js277e/hong_kong_govt_ousts_four_democraticallyelected/):

> With pro-democracy legislators no longer accounting for one-third of the lawmakers, the final straw of democracy in the legislation of Hong Kong has been destroyed. Now all sensible people can look through the facade China and the puppet-government of Hong Kong have kept for years.

## British companies will be forced to reveal the sources of their raw materials, under new laws to end deforestation

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/10/british-companies-will-forced-reveal-sources-raw-materials-new/):

> British companies will be forced to reveal the sources of their raw materials under new laws to clamp down on deforestation, the government has revealed. Sourcing materials in a way which illegally degrades the environment abroad will be made illegal under the Environment Bill, ministers announced, in response to a government consultation. According to a new government report, 80 per cent of deforestation is linked to the expansion of agriculture, with land being cleared to make way for grazing animals and to grow crops.

> Not to be overly pessimistic, but that will only create a market in far off islands to offload the unethical raw materials and reload and repackage them as coming form said island.
> 
> They do this with venezuelian oil since the US doesn't allow for it's importation....
