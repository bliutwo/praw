## Amazon rainforest ‘will collapse if Bolsonaro remains president’

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/amazon-rainforest-will-collapse-if-bolsonaro-remains-president):

> The collapse of the Amazon rainforest is inevitable if Jair Bolsonaro remains president of Brazil, academics and environmental activists have warned amid a fresh government assault on protections for the forest. Since Bolsonaro took power in 2019, deforestation and fire in the Amazon have risen to their highest levels in more than a decade. "It is now clear that a solution for the Amazon can only be possible if we change government. There is no hope if Bolsonaro is re-elected president. It is either the Amazon or Bolsonaro. There is no space for both."

`/u/dromni` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/okb8fi/amazon_rainforest_will_collapse_if_bolsonaro/):

> It's not as if previous Brazilian presidents did a better job of protecting the Amazon (with the possible exception of Dilma and Temer) - [graph of total area of Amazon deforestation by year](https://cdn.noticiasagricolas.com.br/dbimagens/75ea83882d34f173c50190741bd1fc61.jpg). (Edit: found [another graph](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01368-x) in English, though covering a smaller time span.) It looks like a systemic problem of Brazil, regardless of who is the president.
> 
> Of course, unlike his predecessors, Bolsonaro doesn't even *pretend* that he's doing something.

## US to begin evacuation of Afghans who aided US military

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-7efdf3059a2d356b8d8506d991aca9f5?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter):

> WASHINGTON - The Biden administration said Wednesday that it is prepared to begin evacuation flights for Afghan interpreters and translators who aided the U.S. military effort in the nearly 20-year war - but their destinations are still unknown and there are lingering questions about how to ensure their safety until they can get on planes. The Biden administration has also been working on identifying a third country or U.S. territory that could host Afghans while their visa applications are processed. Biden announced last week that the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan will end on Aug. 31.The firming of the date to end the war comes after President Donald Trump's administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1, 2021.
