## Lithuania bluntly rejects Russia's order to arrest an exiled ally of Alexei Navalny, says it raises doubts about Russia

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-lithuania-moscow-arrests-russia-e050b5dad5215f0815eb63fab23e3b40):

> The action against Leonid Volkov by the Basmanny District Court was seen as part of an effort by authorities to squelch demonstrations demanding the release of Navalny, a top Kremlin foe who has been jailed since Jan. 17.Volkov, a chief strategist for Navalny, was charged with encouraging minors to take part in unauthorized rallies, which could land him in jail for up to three years. More protests rocked Moscow and St. Petersburg after a Moscow court on Feb. 2 sentenced Navalny to two years and eight months in prison for violating terms of his probation while recuperating in Germany. The United States and the European Union have urged Russia to release Navalny, but the Kremlin has accused them of meddling in Russia's internal affairs and warned that it won't listen to Western criticism of Navalny's sentencing and police actions against his supporters.

> Russia has whole bunch of people whom it refuses to extradite to Lithuania. So I doubt Russia had any illusions about Lithuania's willingness to hand over anyone and especially this one person.
