## Korean scientists developed a cancer-targeted phototherapeutic agent that promises complete elimination of cancer cells without side effects. It involves only one injection and repeated phototherapy. In a mouse model, it showed no toxicity while the cancer was completely removed.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/nrco-cwl011121.php):

> The research team developed a peptide-based photosensitizer that activates phototherapeutic effects only in cancer tissues by using the internalizing RGD peptide that can selectively penetrate and target cancer tissues, and by proper design for the modulation of its reaction to light. The phototherapeutic agent developed by the researchers was injected into a mouse model implanted with a tumor, and the photosensitizer was stored around the tumor and was continuously released for a long time, demonstrating the ability of selectively targeting the tumor with just a single injection around the cancerous tissues. "The developed phototherapeutic agent is expected to be useful in future phototherapy as it allows long-term repeated phototherapy without toxicity after only one injection around the cancer until the complete removal of the cancer, and has a simple formulation with a single component," he added.
