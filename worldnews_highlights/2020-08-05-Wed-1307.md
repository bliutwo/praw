## Trump's new ambassador to Germany attacked Merkel for giving money to 'unwanted Muslim invaders' and said migrants want to turn Europe into 'an Islamic state'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/douglas-macgregor-attacked-merkel-immigration-policy-2020-8):

> President Trump's pick for US ambassador to Germany accused Angela Merkel of prioritizing "Unwanted Muslim invaders" over military aid and said Muslim migrants wanted to turn Europe "Into an Islamic state." Macgregor, a frequent guest on Fox News, has accused both Germany and the EU's immigration policies of being too welcoming to Muslim migrants, claiming that they have "The goal of eventually turning Europe into an Islamic state." In a series of comments unearthed by CNN, Macregor in 2018 attacked Chancellor Merkel's decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees to Germany during the migrant crisis, claiming she was "More concerned about providing free services to millions of unwanted Muslim invaders, to be blunt, than it does about its own armed forces in the defense of its country."

## Tesco urged to ditch meat company over alleged links to Amazon deforestation - Responding to Greenpeace campaign to cut links to Brazilian meat giant JBS, supermarket calls on government to ensure all UK food is deforestation-free

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/05/tesco-urged-to-ditch-meat-company-over-alleged-links-to-amazon-deforestation):

> The move comes in response to a new Greenpeace campaign calling on the supermarket to cut links to JBS, the world's biggest meat company, over its alleged links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation. Its YouGov poll found that 26% of respondents think supermarkets should sell less meat and 55% "Would not consider buying meat from companies that also buy meat from farms in areas that were recently Amazon rainforest." In response to Greenpeace's claims that the company is indirectly sourcing cattle from farms in the Amazon involved in deforestation, a spokesperson said: "All JBS subsidiary companies adhere to strict responsible procurement policies throughout their supply chains and share our dedication to eliminating deforestation for good."

## After blast, Lebanon has less than a month's grain reserves

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-security-blast-wheat-idUSKCN251190?taid=5f2a9967f1042a00013d3e31&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter):

> BEIRUT/DUBAI - Lebanon's main grain silo at Beirut port was destroyed in a blast, leaving the nation with less than a month's reserves of the grain but enough flour to avoid a crisis, the economy minister said on Wednesday. He said grain reserves in Lebanon's remaining silos stood at "a bit less than a month" but said the destroyed silos had only held 15,000 tonnes of the grain at the time, much less than capacity which one official put at 120,000 tonnes. Reserves of flour were sufficient to cover market needs for a month and a half and there were four ships carrying 28,000 tonnes of wheat heading to Lebanon, Ahmed Hattit, the head of the wheat importers union, told Al-Akhbar newspaper.

## Brazil: Bolsonaro vetoes financial compensation for health workers

Summary of [original article](https://brazilian.report/coronavirus-brazil-live-blog/2020/08/04/bolsonaro-vetoes-financial-compensation-for-health-workers-debilitated-by-covid-19/):

> On Tuesday, President Jair Bolsonaro vetoed a Congress proposal to grant health workers debilitated by Covid-19 BRL 50,000 in compensation for their services. "Mr. Bolsonaro disdains the lives of Brazilians and health workers who are on the front line in the war against the coronavirus. This veto against our bill that guarantees compensation to health workers and victims of Covid-19 is further testament to his genocidal policy," Ms. Melchionna declared, on a social media post. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, health workers at the forefront of efforts against the coronavirus have been ill equipped and inadequately supported, suffering from a lack of personal protection equipment and no financial compensation against the health problems caused by Covid-19.

`/u/TheGreatOffWhiteHype` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i43jne/brazil_bolsonaro_vetoes_financial_compensation/):

> Bolsonaro was kicked out of the army for being incompetent. As state representative for over 20 years, he got one bill passed. He has ties with rogue police militias. After elected president, he stacked his cabinet with generals and extremist evangelicals. He’s a misogynist, a racist and has no concern for the indigenous population. He’s directly interfered with the equivalent of the Brazilian FBI because they were investigating one of his corrupt sons. He praises the military coup of 1964 and wishes to return to a military state. He’s anti LGBTQ and abortions. He’s ignored the pandemic saying it was nothing but a little flu. He endorses the use of  hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid. He regularly holds public gatherings where no one wears a mask or keep social distancing. Finally, he’s dumber than a sack of rocks.

## Trump Was Talking Nonsense When He Called Beirut Explosion “an Attack,” Say Pentagon Officials

Summary of [original article](https://www.newpakweb.com/trump-was-talking-nonsense-when-he-called-beirut-explosion-an-attack-say-pentagon-officials/):

> Earlier on Tuesday, hours after the deadly explosion in Lebanon's capital Beirut, US president Donald Trump pulled the plug by calling Beirut's Blast "a terrible attack" carried out using a "Bomb of some kind." However, Pentagon's officials say they have no idea of what Donald Trump was talking when he called Beirut explosion "A terrible Attack." According to details, President Donald Trump on Tuesday cast a massive explosion that killed dozens of people and wounded thousands in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, as a possible attack and offered U.S. help. Three US Defense Department officials told CNN that as of Tuesday night there was no indication that the massive explosion that rocked Beirut on Tuesday were an "Attack," contradicting an earlier claim from President Donald Trump.

> It’s amazing how meaningless the president’s words are. He’s made it so that everyone intelligent just ignores him.
