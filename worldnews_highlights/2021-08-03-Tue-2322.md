> > The videos of the killing of Mohammed al-Alami were made public by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. Thirteen shots are heard on one of the videos, which were filmed near at a makeshift cemetery serving the Hebron-area town of Beit Ummar. The footage shows that when the boy's father, who was driving the car, approached the soldiers, he then immediately backed up. Three soldiers are seen running toward the car. Several shots are then heard.

> The Republican governor said the State Board of Administration added London-based Unilever to its list of "Scrutinized companies" that boycott Israel. The company's founders, Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, said in a recent New York Times opinion piece that they no longer control the company but approve of the action in Israel as reflecting their progressive values. Florida officials say the company told them in a call Wednesday that there are no plans to change Ben & Jerry's stance on Israel.
