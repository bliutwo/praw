> I worked there briefly and I can tell you the major problem is that so many people aspire to work at Blizzard and will do anything and put up with anything to be a part of their games that Blizzard really has no reason to pay people better.

## New Evidence Suggests Young Children Spread Covid-19 More Efficiently Than Adults

Summary of [original article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/07/31/new-evidence-suggests-young-children-spread-covid-19-more-efficiently-than-adults):

> Two new studies, though from different parts of the world, have arrived at the same conclusion: that young children not only transmit SARS-CoV-2 efficiently, but may be major drivers of the pandemic as well. According to the results, children 5 years and younger who develop mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms have 10 to 100 times as much SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx as older children and adults. The researchers found that although young children had a somewhat lower risk of infection than adults and were less likely to become ill, children age 14 and younger transmit the virus more efficiently to other children and adults than adults themselves.

## Physicists: 90% Chance of Human Society Collapsing Within Decades | "Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10 percent in most optimistic estimate, to survive," the authors write

> Just so people know, this was done based off a model, which assumes deforestation/population rates are constant. In other words, they are making predictions based off the assumption that humans  do nothing about it and take no action (even though these responses are ongoing)
> 
> Most importantly, they use deforestation as a surrogate measure for all Human Resources. There is many other methods to obtain resources, and therefor this model cannot generalize to the world we live in. Additionally, when demand exceeds resources, of course the growth curve plateaus, or decreases. But to make a stretch by saying ‘total extinction’ isn’t right - it certainly functions to grasp ones attention and gain views.
> 
> For those still reading, This is simply a sensationalist article. Although global/human health are important topics that need ongoing action, there is many other resources to learn this information from.
