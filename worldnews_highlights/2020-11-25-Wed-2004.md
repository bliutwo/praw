> Edward Snowden said the "War on whistleblowers" trend in the U.S. that expanded during former President Barack Obama's administration and continued under President Donald Trump is evidence of a growing "Criminalization of journalism." Snowden spoke about the freedom of the press during a video interview with Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who first helped Snowden expose information from the National Security Agency when Snowden took his first steps toward becoming an internationally recognized government whistleblower in 2013. Greenwald asked Snowden about his concerns regarding the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who was part of the Obama administration that Snowden said saw the escalation of the "War on whistleblowers." Snowden said the freedom of the press will "Continue to decline" until there is "An actual policy shift."

Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company's biggest market after the United States - since 2013, most recently last month during its "Prime Day" promotional event. Last week, Amazon bowed to government pressure in France to postpone its local Black Friday event by a week to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown.

## Xi Jinping sends congratulations to US president-elect Joe Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3111377/xi-jinping-sends-congratulations-us-president-elect-joe-biden):

> A week later, China's Foreign Ministry offered cautious congratulations to Biden and Harris but stopped short of calling Biden the president-elect and said China understood the election results needed to be confirmed in accordance with US rules and tradition. With several veteran diplomats who have experience dealing with China in the incoming administration, hopes are rising that China and the US can resume cooperation on global issues such as climate change and seek to ease tensions, though confrontation over human rights and security is expected to continue. Biden said in an interview earlier this year that China was a competitor, and before the election said that he would force China to play by the international rules when it came to trade, treatment of foreign companies and its actions in the South China Sea.Trump "Embraces thugs like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all of our friends, all of our allies", Biden said during the final presidential debate last month.

## 6,000 years of arrows emerge from melting Norwegian ice patch

Summary of [original article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/11/6000-years-arrows-emerge-melting-norway-ice-patch/):

> Expeditions to survey the Langfonne ice patch in 2014 and 2016, both particularly warm summers, also revealed copious reindeer bones and antlers, suggesting that hunters used the ice patch over the course of millennia. Since archaeologists started systematically surveying melting ice sites 15 years ago, ice patches from Norway to North America have yielded almost perfectly-preserved artifacts from long-ago time periods. Langfonne was one of the first ice patch sites to come to light, after a local hiker discovered a 3,300-year-old leather shoe sitting next to the edge of the ice patch in the summer of 2006 and reported it to archaeologist Lars PilÃ¸, now a researcher at the Innlandet County Council Cultural Heritage Department and a co-author of the new study.
