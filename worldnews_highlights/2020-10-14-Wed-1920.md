## Berlin gives middle finger to anti-maskers in tourism agency ad

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/14/berlin-gives-middle-finger-to-anti-maskers-in-tourism-agency-ad):

> An ad placed in local papers by the German capital's senate as part of a public information campaign shows an elderly woman presenting her outstretched middle finger to the camera, next to the words: "A finger-wag for all those without a mask: we stick to corona rules." In a city that prides itself on its Berliner Schnauze - the coarse-but-hearty "Berlin gob" - public service messaging could not afford to moralise from on high, said a spokesperson for Visit Berlin, the tourism agency that developed the campaign. In the past, Berlin's public transport company BVG has won numerous prizes for an ad campaign that embraces rather than apologises for the capital's image as the shambolic outlier in a county priding itself on efficiency and respectability.

> >“We wanted to use a language that suits the Berlin character and that underscores the dramatic pandemic situation – and that we managed,” the spokesperson told the Guardian.
> 
> I think it's a perfect way to get the message across.

## 61 people who went to Canadian spin studio get coronavirus despite adhering to public health guidelines

Summary of [original article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/61-people-who-went-to-Canadian-spin-studio-get-15647189.php):

> Now, despite appearing to have complied with public health regulations, at least 61 people linked to the studio have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Although Hamilton requires masks to be worn in most public settings, the law includes an exemption for anyone "Actively engaged in an athletic or fitness activity." In keeping with that policy, the studio, SPINCO, allowed riders to remove their masks once clipped into their bikes, and told them to cover up again before dismounting. The outbreak offers is evidence of the dangers of people gathering indoors without masks, and health experts warn that cases could spike further in the coming months as winter weather sets in and outdoor gatherings and exercise classes will be harder to continue.

`/u/triplab` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jb9t2q/61_people_who_went_to_canadian_spin_studio_get/):

> >"Even though they followed guidelines, there was obviously significant transmission," Yaffe said, "so I think we do need to review the guidelines and that's in process."
> 
> Ya think?  Ok, so you must wear a mask until you are clipped in to your bike. Then, for the next hour while you spin, sweat, breathe hard, you are good. But as soon as you get off that bike, mask up again.  Really?

## Golden Dawn leadership sentenced to 13 years in prison

Summary of [original article](https://www.ekathimerini.com/258056/article/ekathimerini/news/golden-dawn-leadership-sentenced-to-13-years-in-prison):

> A Greek court sentenced the leadership of the extreme-right Golden Dawn party to 13 years in prison Wednesday, imposing the near-maximum penalty for running a criminal organization blamed for numerous violent hate crimes. The landmark ruling follows a five-year trial of dozens of top officials, members and supporters of Golden Dawn, an organization founded as a neo-Nazi group in the 1980s that rose to become Greece's third-largest political during a major financial crisis in the previous decade. Eleven other former parliament members were jailed for between five and seven years for membership of a criminal organization, while a party associate was given a life sentence for the murder of Greek rap singer Pavlos Fyssas in a 2013 attack that triggered the crackdown against the party.
