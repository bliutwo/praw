## Germany is beginning a universal basic income trial with individuals getting $1,400 a month for 3 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-begins-universal-basic-income-trial-three-years-2020-8):

> Germany is about to become the latest country to trial a universal basic income after 1,500 people signed up to a three-year experiment into how it affects the economy and the wellbeing of recipients. Universal basic income is the idea that a government should pay a lump sum of money to each of its citizens, usually once a month, regardless of their income and employment status, effectively replacing means-tested benefits. Finland experimented its with own form of Universal Basic Income for nearly two years between January 2017 and December 2018 but concluded that while it led to people out of work feeling happier, it did not lead to increased employment, the BBC reported.
