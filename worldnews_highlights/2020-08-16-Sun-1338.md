> Kenya's Elephant Population Has Doubled Since 1980s Kenya's elephant population has more than doubled since the 1980s, and one national park is currently having a 'baby boom' thanks to a relief from drought and a drop in poaching. Kenya's Wildlife Service said the country has seen its elephant population increase from 16,000 elephants in 1989 to 34,800 by the end of 2019. Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Tourism and Wildlife, Najib Balala, says that growth in elephant population is in part due to the country's efforts to stop poachers.

## Belarus ambassador declares solidarity with opposition protesters

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belarus-protests-ambassador-alexander-lukashenko-nasha-niva-slovakia-a9672771.html):

> The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia has broken rank to declare solidarity with protesters in Belarus following the country's disputed presidential election. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, has faced down a week of street demonstrations and refused demands for a re-run of an election protesters say was massively rigged to disguise the fact that he has lost public support. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Mr Lukashenko's opposition rival in the contested election, has called for a huge "March of Freedom" through the centre of Minsk, the Belarusian capital, on Sunday morning.

## Thailand's largest pro-democracy rally in years draws 10,000

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/thailands-largest-pro-democracy-rally-in-years-draws-10000/a-54588173):

> An anti-government protest in Thailand's capital Bangkok drew at least 10,000 people on Sunday, police said, making it the largest political demonstration the kingdom has seen in years. The last demand is particularly sensitive in Thailand - anyone criticizing the monarchy faces between 1.5 to 15 years in jail. Thailand has experienced multiple coups ever since the army toppled the absolute monarchy in 1932, replacing it with a constitutional monarchy.

## Thousands return to streets in Israel urging Netanyahu to resign

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/thousands-return-streets-israel-urging-netanyahu-resign-200816021834656.html):

> Thousands of demonstrators have returned to the streets of Jerusalem calling for the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over allegations of corruption and his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. Netanyahu has dismissed the demonstrators as "Leftists" and "Anarchists" and accused local media of strengthening the protests by giving them heavy coverage. In recent days, Netanyahu got a political boost after Israel announced a historic normalisation of diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates.

> I hope these people (including the ones in Belarus, Brazil, Beirut etc.) actually have a good replacement for these governments, because there might as well be a new government that is equally shitty

## More than 10,000 Thai protesters chanting "down with dictatorship" and "the country belongs to the people" rallied in Bangkok on Sunday in by far the biggest anti-government demonstration since a 2014 coup. There were cheers for student calls to curb the monarchy's powers - once a taboo subject

> More than 10,000 Thai protesters chanting "Down with dictatorship" and "The country belongs to the people" rallied in Bangkok on Sunday in by far the biggest anti-government demonstration since a 2014 coup. Students have led protests almost daily for the past month, but Sunday's demonstration drew a broader crowd in the Southeast Asian country, which has experienced decades of protests punctuated by military coups. "The prime minister sends his concern to officials and protesters to avoid violence," Traisulee Traisoranakul, a government spokeswoman, told reporters.

## Germany's biggest union calls for 4-day week to save thousands of jobs

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-biggest-union-calls-for-4-day-week-to-save-thousands-of-jobs/a-54582132):

> Germany's largest trade union IG Metall proposed a four-day working week ahead of the next round of collective bargaining talks due to begin next year, reported German media on Saturday. The shorter week would be "The answer to structural changes in sectors such as the automotive industry," said union chair Jörg Hoffman to German national newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. In the upcoming union talks, Hoffman said IG Metall would call for a wage increase for workers, despite the recession.

`/u/Skwissgaaar` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iajvhw/germanys_biggest_union_calls_for_4day_week_to/):

> They're calling for a wage increase (probably hourly wage increase) as well as a 4 day work week. They would probably get paid less, and they would work less. I would imagine the hourly wage increase would help offset the impact of the pay cut. There will probably be a pay cut, but seeing as how these are metal workers, they're most likely going to still get paid enough to live comfortably. Money isn't everything.
