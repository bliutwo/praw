## Airbnb asked Canada for a bailout. Canada slapped Airbnb with a tax.

Summary of [original article](https://thinkpol.ca/2020/12/01/airbnb-asked-canada-for-a-bailout-canada-slapped-airbnb-with-a-tax/):

> It's about to get a lot more expensive to stay at short-term rentals in Canada as Ottawa announced a new tax on Airbnb and other short-term accommodation platforms. "In order to ensure that the GST/HST applies consistently and effectively with respect to supplies of short-term accommodation in Canada facilitated by platforms, the Government proposes to apply the GST/HST on all supplies of short-term accommodation in Canada facilitated through a digital platform," according to the federal government's fiscal update released on Monday by Finance Minister Chrystia FreelandFall Economic Statement 2020 Supporting Canadians and Fighting COVID-19 https://www. The tax will also apply to any service fees charged by the Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms.

## UN: Food has run out for nearly 100,000 refugees in Ethiopia

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/international-news-eritrea-abiy-ahmed-ethiopia-united-nations-344e7156295eb1801f9441a9359c2dab):

> NAIROBI, Kenya - The United Nations says food has now run out for the nearly 100,000 refugees from Eritrea who have been sheltering in camps in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, which has been cut off from the world for nearly a month amid fighting. The U.N. has said some 2 million people in Tigray now need assistance - a doubling from the number before the fighting - and some 1 million people are displaced, including more than 45,000 Ethiopians who have fled into Sudan as refugees. "UNHCR appeals to the government of Ethiopia to continue to fulfill its responsibility in hosting and protecting Eritrean refugees and allow humanitarians to access people who are now desperately in need."

`/u/soldflink` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k4kowt/un_food_has_run_out_for_nearly_100000_refugees_in/):

> "The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis "of biblical proportions", or "hunger pandemic". This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way."

## Huge Puerto Rico radio telescope collapses; many mourning

`/u/Andromeda321` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k4k85y/huge_puerto_rico_radio_telescope_collapses_many/):

> Radio astronomer here- this is a sad day for science. We will never see the likes of Arecibo again and I literally have colleagues crying right now, not just because of the science lost but because Arecibo was so close to many lives. (Many got their first start in the field at Arecibo through its student programs, I know at least one couple that met there, and it was iconic in Puerto Rican identity.)
> 
> FAQ, along with my post last week that addressed a lot of the questions then:
> 
> **What happened?** There was a cable break in August, followed by a main cable break holding the gigantic 900 ton feed horn (that James Bond ran on- or rather his stunt double, astronomers bragged Pierce Brosnan was too scared to do what they do every day), and it looks like the entire thing finally collapsed onto the dish below. It was the size of the house and where all the expensive equipment was. 
> 
> **Can they fix it?** No. This is the equivalent on an optical telescope of the bottom where your eyepiece/camera falling out and smashing a hole in the mirror. It’s gone. 
> 
> **Did they save any of the millions of dollars of equipment?** Again, no. It was far too dangerous to get into the horn once the main cable snapped and engineering reports indicate they were keeping people *very* far from it. For good reason based on this development...
> 
> **What happens now?** The NSF is under contract to return the telescope site to its original natural state so I guess the demolition will begin. There is not money or interest in rebuilding this magnificent engineering marvel. 
> 
> *Q&A from last week*
> 
> To answer some questions you might have:
> 
> **It's a 50 year old telescope- was it still doing good science?** Short answer: yes.  Arecibo has had a storied history doing a lot of great radio astronomy- while [its SETI days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) are behind it (it hasn't really done SETI in years) the telescope has done a ton of amazing science over the years- in fact, Arecibo gave us one Nobel Prize for the [discovery of the first binary pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1937%2B21) (which was the first indirect discovery of gravitational waves!).  More recently, Arecibo was [the first radio telescope on the planet to discover a repeating Fast Radio Burst \(FRB\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst#FRB_121102)- the newest class of weird radio signal- which was a giant milestone in our quest to understand what they are (we now think they are probably from a souped up type of pulsar, called a magnetar, thanks in large part to the work Arecibo has done).  Finally, Arecibo was also a huge partner in [nanoGRAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Nanohertz_Observatory_for_Gravitational_Waves)- an amazing group aiming to detect gravitational waves via measuring pulsars really carefully- so that's a huge setback there.
> 
> **Can't other radio telescopes just pick up the slack?** Yes and no.  [FAST in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope) is an amazing dish that's even bigger than Arecibo, so that'll be great, but right now is still pretty limited in the kind of science it can do.  Second, it doesn't really have the capability to transmit and receive like Arecibo does- Arecibo was basically the biggest interplanetary radar out there, and FAST has said they might do that but it's not currently clear the timeline on that- Arecibo would do this to update the shape and orbits of asteroids that might hit Earth someday using radar, for example, so we just don't have that capability anymore.
> 
> Beyond that, you could of course do *some* science Arecibo has been traditionally doing on telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBI), but those are oversubscribed- there are literally only so many hours in a day, and right now the VLA for example will receive proposals for 2-3x as much telescope time as they can give.  Losing Arecibo means getting telescope time is now going to be that much more competitive.
> 
> **Why don't we just build a bigger telescope?  One on the far side of the moon sounds great!** I agree!  But good Lord, Arecibo has been struggling for *years* because the NSF couldn't scratch together a few million dollars to keep it running, which probably led to the literal dish falling apart.  Do you really think a nation that can't find money to perform basic maintenance is going to cough up to build a radio telescope on the far side of the moon anytime soon?!  Radio astronomy funding has been *disastrous* in recent years, with our flagship observatories literally falling apart, and the best future instruments are now being constructed abroad (FAST in China, SKA in South Africa/Australia).  Chalk this up as a symbol for American investment in science as a whole, really...
> 
> So yeah, there we have it- it's a sad day for me.  I actually was lucky enough to [visit Arecibo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/d49tz7/i_think_im_going_to_need_a_bigger_antenna/) just over [a year ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/4oW7RTr) (on my honeymoon!), and I'm really happy now that I had the chance to see the telescope in person that's inspired so much.  And I'm also really sad right now because science aside, a lot of people are now going to lose their jobs, and I know how important Arecibo was to Puerto Rico, both in terms of education/science but as a cultural icon.
> 
> TL;DR this is a sad day for American science.  We will definitely know a little less about the universe for no longer having the Arecibo Observatory in it.

## 'Will not be bullied': citizens around the world told to buy Australian wine in stand against China

> The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, comprising more than 200 MPs from a range of political parties and representing 19 country legislatures, has launched a campaign to convince people to buy and drink Australian wine in December, as a show of solidarity. It comes after China slapped tariffs of up to 212 per cent against Australian wine producers, which Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said would spell a "Hellishly tough time for Australia's winemakers." A video campaign has also been launched by an alliance of politicians from around the world to convince people to buy and drink Australian wine amid growing tensions with Beijing.
