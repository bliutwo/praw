Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c):

> MOSCOW - Chanting slogans against President Vladimir Putin, tens of thousands took to the streets Sunday across Russia to demand the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, keeping up nationwide protests that have rattled the Kremlin. Navalny's team initially called for Sunday's protest to be held on Moscow's Lubyanka Square, home to the main headquarters of the Federal Security Service, which Navalny contends was responsible for his poisoning. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde, who currently chairs the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, condemned "The excessive use of force by authorities and mass detention of peaceful protesters and journalists" and urged Russia "To release all those unjustly detained, including Navalny."

Bolsonaro vetoes the entirety of the bill that determines the federal government should pay financial compensation to health workers and professionals who are incapacitated due to their role in the fight against Covid-19.The Bolsonaro government ignores Pfizer's proposal.
