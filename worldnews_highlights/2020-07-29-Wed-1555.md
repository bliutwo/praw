## WHO warns that waiting to achieve herd immunity to the coronavirus will kill a lot of people

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/who-warns-that-waiting-to-achieve-herd-immunity-to-the-coronavirus-will-kill-a-lot-of-people.html):

> Herd immunity is necessary to really contain a virus, according to epidemiologists. Simply waiting for herd immunity to happen by allowing the virus to spread, as some opponents of social distancing measures have suggested, is dangerous, he added. While the virus may not totally disappear, it's possible world leaders and public health officials could work to bring the virus down to "Low levels," he told the TB Alliance.

## Trump Admits He’s Never Mentioned Bounties to Putin Because He Thinks It’s ‘Fake News’

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admits-hes-never-mentioned-bounties-to-putin-because-he-thinks-its-fake-news?ref=home):

> President Donald Trump has admitted that he failed to mention U.S. intelligence that indicates Russia paid the Taliban to kill American troops during a call with Vladimir Putin last week. Asked why he skirted the issue with Putin last week, Trump replied: "That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that's an issue that many people said was fake news." The White House insisted Trump was never briefed, but then it was later reported that it was included in the President's Daily Brief in February-and he may have simply failed to read it.

In a separate row, EU officials were "Furious" with the Trump administration, Bloomberg reported, after the president moved to shut Germany and the rest of the EU out of White House talks between leaders of Serbia and Kosovo.
