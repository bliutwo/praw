## 'Homosexual People Have the Right to Be in a Family.' Pope Francis Offers New Support for Same-Sex Civil Unions

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5902186/pope-francis-supports-same-sex-civil-unions-francesco/):

> Pope Francis endorsed same-sex civil unions for the first time as pontiff while being interviewed for the feature-length documentary "Francesco," which premiered Wednesday at the Rome Film Festival. Cruz, who is gay, said that during his first meetings with the pope in May 2018 after they patched things up, Francis assured him that God made Cruz gay. One of them was his former student, Yayo Grassi, who along with his partner visited Francis at the Vatican's Washington D.C. embassy during the pope's 2015 visit to the U.S. The Vatican publicized that encounter, making video and photos of it available, after Francis was ambushed during that same visit by his then-ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who invited the anti-gay marriage activist Kim Davis to meet with the pope.

> Pope Francis sounds exactly like someone who would ask : "What would Jesus do?" before speaking.
> 
> And I mean the  Jesus of the New Testament, not the "supply-side" Jesus...

## South Africa Makes Strides and Passes Same-Sex Marriage Law

`/u/ctnguy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jh4fz2/south_africa_makes_strides_and_passes_samesex/):

> I wrote up [the Wikipedia article on the new law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Union_Amendment_Act,_2020) yesterday, so let me give a bit of a summary that explains what it's about.
> 
> There  are two types of marriage officers (people who can legally solemnise  marriages) in South African law: clergy/religious leaders who perform  marriages according to their religion's rules; and government employees  who are appointed to perform civil marriages - mostly magistrates (a  kind of judge) and civil servants in the Department of Home Affairs.
> 
> **Same-sex marriage has been legal in South Africa since 2006**, but a provision  was included in the law which said that the government-employed marriage  officers could opt out of performing them if they had a religious objection. Which might have been OK in theory, except that there were so  many objections filed that there were some areas of the country with no  officials who would perform civil same-sex marriages.
> 
> The  new law takes away the opt-out for government-employed marriage  officers. There is a two-year adjustment period where the opt-out is  still valid, but the Department of Home Affairs is required to make sure  that every branch office has at least one official who can perform  same-sex marriages.
> 
> The clergy who  are marriage officers are not affected by this: they remain free to  decide which marriage to perform according to the beliefs of their  religion.

## Bolivia’s president Arce vows to ‘rebuild’ country as landslide socialist win confirmed

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bolivia-president-luis-arce-socialist-election-morales-b1279153.html):

> Bolivia's president-elect Luis Arce pledged on Friday to "Rebuild" the Andean country after a tumultuous year thanks to political turmoil and the pandemic, as the official vote count confirmed a landslide win for his socialist party. "Now our great challenge is to rebuild our homeland in peace, to regain joy, stability and hope for a better tomorrow for all Bolivians," Mr Arce said on social media in response to the final result, with a video of his support around the country. Mr Mesa, who also placed second in the since-voided 2019 vote, congratulated Mr Arce on Twitter, though he already conceded defeat at the start of the week when rapid counts showed a big Arce win.
