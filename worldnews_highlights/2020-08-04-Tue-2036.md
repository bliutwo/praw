## Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-53650246):

> The video of Mr Ghappar, along with a number of accompanying text messages also passed to the BBC, together provide a chilling and extremely rare first-hand account of China's highly secure and secretive detention system - sent directly from the inside. In 2009, Merdan Ghappar - like many Uighurs at that time - left Xinjiang to seek opportunity in China's wealthier cities in the east. There is evidence of other Uighurs being forced to return home, either from elsewhere in China or from abroad, and Mr Ghappar's family were convinced that he had disappeared into the re-education camps.

## Coca-Cola 'paid scientists to downplay how sugary beverages fueled the obesity crisis between 2013-2015,' medical journal study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8589497/Coca-Colas-work-scientists-low-point-history-public-health.html):

> Coca-Cola's work with scientists to downplay the role sugar plays in contributing to obesity has been called a 'low point in this history of public health. For the analysis, published in Public Health Nutrition, researchers from the University of Oxford; the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; the University of Bocconi in Milan, Italy; and US Right to Know teamed up. 'Coke used public health academics to carry out classic tobacco tactics to protect its profits,' said Gary Ruskin, the executive director of US Right to Know.'It's a low point in the history of public health and a warning about the perils of accepting corporate funding for public health work.

Summary of [original article](https://www.arre.co.in/coronavirus/priest-gujarat-godman-covid-19-prasad-with-saliva/):

> Last month, a priest in Gujarat's Ahmedabad died due to Covid-19. A Hindu priest in Ahmedabad has died of COVID. Here's the kicker though, remember the fake news circulated by brahmin media abt "Spitting on food" to villify muslims? This pandit was actually feeding devotees his saliva laced sweets as 'prasad', single handedly infecting 1000s. This godman from Gujarat, Purushottam Priyadas, who distributed prasad laced with his saliva, has died of Covid.
