## Mass grave uncovered of people killed during Russian armed and led officiating of Sloviansk in 2014

Summary of [original article](http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1597801489):

> A grave has been exhumed in Sloviansk containing the remains of people killed during the months in 2014 when Sloviansk was under the control of 'former' Russian military intelligence officer Igor Girkin and his militants. On 24 July 2014, just weeks after the militants fled the advancing Ukrainian Army, a major exhumation was carried out which uncovered the bodies of 14 civilians believed to have been killed by Girkin and his Russian and pro-Russian militants. Russian television had already tried to pass the murders off as the work of Ukrainian soldiers, claiming - falsely - that they had been killed for helping the militants.

> From the article: 
> 
> "The police note that this is not the first such exhumation of mass graves in Sloviansk.  On 24 July 2014, just weeks after the militants fled the advancing Ukrainian Army, a major exhumation was carried out which uncovered the bodies of 14 civilians believed to have been killed by Girkin and his Russian and pro-Russian militants. 
> 
>  These included four members of the Evangelical Church of the Transfiguration in Sloviansk: the two sons - Reuben and Albert – of Paster Oleksandr Pavenko, and two deacons of the church Viktor Bradarsky and Volodymyr Velichko.  The four were abducted from the Trinity Sunday festive service on June 8, and are believed to have been tortured and then killed the next day.  
> 
> Russian television had already tried to pass the murders off as the work of Ukrainian soldiers, claiming – falsely – that they had been killed for helping the militants.  In fact, they may have been killed to steal their cars – which would not be the first time that militants, treated as heroes by Russia, killed purely for gain."

> Absolutely chilling.

## Germany is beginning a universal-basic-income trial with people getting $1,400 a month for 3 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-begins-universal-basic-income-trial-three-years-2020-8):

> Germany is about to become the latest country to trial a universal basic income after 1,500 people signed up to a three-year experiment into how it affects the economy and the wellbeing of recipients. Universal basic income is the idea that a government should pay a lump sum of money to each of its citizens, usually once a month, regardless of their income and employment status, effectively replacing means-tested benefits. Finland experimented its with own form of Universal Basic Income for nearly two years between January 2017 and December 2018 but concluded that while it led to people out of work feeling happier, it did not lead to increased employment, the BBC reported.

## EU rejects Belarus vote result, warns of imminent new sanctions

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/eu-leaders-seek-ramp-pressure-belarus-leader-lukashenko-200819084402186.html):

> The European Union has rejected the result of the disputed Belarus election, saying President Alexander Lukashenko's victory was neither free nor fair, and warned of imminent fresh sanctions against his government. The EU has been working on a new round of sanctions against Belarus, targeting those involved in allegedly fixing the August 9 vote and in the bloody repression of protests, which have shaken Lukashenko's grip on the ex-Soviet republic as never before. "The people in Belarus know what they want ... that's why we want an independent path for Belarus where the political conditions are decided by the country itself," she said.

## US Senate report says Russian investor in Braidy Industries' mill is a proxy for the Kremlin

Summary of [original article](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/08/19/senate-report-russian-investor-braidy-mill-kremlin-proxy/5607217002/):

> A Russian company that has invested in Braidy Industries' planned aluminum rolling mill in Eastern Kentucky was identified as a proxy of the Kremlin in a new report the Senate Intelligence Committee released this week. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission report Braidy filed in June said Rusal had provided $75 million so far for the mill project as of Dec. 31, 2019, but had discontinued further contributions until Braidy secures another $300 million in funding. The Kentucky Democratic Party on Wednesday questioned McConnell's decision to support lifting the sanctions on Rusal, in light of the Senate Intelligence Committee report's identification of Rusal as a proxy for the Kremlin.
