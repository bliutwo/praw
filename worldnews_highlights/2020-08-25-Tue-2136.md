## Congolese elephant poacher sentenced to 30 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/congolese-elephant-poacher-sentenced-to-30-years/a-54697087?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf):

> A notorious Congolese poacher was convicted to 30 years in prison for ivory trafficking and attempted murder of park rangers, a conservation group said on Tuesday. It is the longest sentence handed to a poacher in the Republic of Congo, which had previously convicted poachers with up to 5 years in prison. Richard Malonga, head of WCS Congo, which works directly with the Nouabale Ndoki park said the detention creates "Opportunities to criminalize acts of poaching, and punish poachers even more severely."

## It's now illegal for Zimbabwe schools to expel pregnant girls

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/illegal-zimbabwe-schools-expel-pregnant-girls-200825152257748.html):

> Zimbabwe has made it illegal for schools to expel pupils who get pregnant, a measure women's rights campaigners said would help tackle gender inequality in the classroom and stop many girls from dropping out of school. Many parents of pregnant girls, or the girls themselves, decide to quit schooling due to the pregnancy, and schools do not always do enough to encourage them to stay, officials say. Pregnancy is just one of the reasons that girls in Zimbabwe could fail to return to classes after coronavirus restrictions are lifted, said Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, communications specialist at Plan International Zimbabwe.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnet.com/news/ai-confirms-50-new-planets-from-old-nasa-data-in-a-groundbreaking-first/):

> The research team created a machine learning algorithm and trained it using data on confirmed planets and false-positives from NASA's retired Kepler mission. In a first, the AI system confirmed 50 planets out of that bunch. Validating planets can help scientists direct their resources to interesting spots in space without wasting their time on "Fake" planets.

## Canada has effectively moved to block China's Huawei from 5G

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-huawei-analysis/canada-has-effectively-moved-to-block-chinas-huawei-from-5g-but-cant-say-so-idUSKBN25L26S):

> OTTAWA - Canada is the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network that has not formally blocked Huawei from 5G networks, but it has effectively done just that, delaying a decision long enough to force telecom companies to exclude the Chinese gear maker. In June, Bell Canada and rival Telus Corp - two of the biggest wireless providers - teamed with Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia Oyj to build fifth-generation telecoms networks, ditching Huawei for the project despite using Huawei 4G gear. Operators in Canada feel the U.S. curbs mean they have no choice but to sideline Huawei in 5G networks, at least for now, say the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

## Call Of Duty Trailer Replaced Worldwide Over Tiananmen Square Footage

Summary of [original article](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/08/call-of-duty-trailer-replaced-worldwide-over-tiananmen-square-footage/):

> The debut trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has been blocked in China, and subsequently edited everywhere else, after featuring around one second's worth of footage from the Communist government's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989. When the game was first announced last week, a trailer running for 2:02 was released to the world and hosted on the official Call of Duty and Xbox YouTube pages, along with major trailer sites like IGN and Gamespot. Nobody really noticed the switch when it took place, but Hong Kong news site Apple Daily and the South China Morning Post point out that it was definitely noticed in China, where the original trailer was swiftly blocked and a lot of people recognised the Tiananmen Square footage and began commenting online.
