## Britons being refused job interviews in Europe because of Brexit, MPs told - Loss of free movement rights means UK workers not suitable for many professional roles

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/job-interviews-british-citizens-europe-brexit-a9593066.html):

> British citizens living in the EU are increasingly being refused job interviews because of their impending Brexit loss of free movement rights, MPs have been told. "We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU," Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee. Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: "There's a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain - there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won't be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this - to go and study and work."

> BRUSSELS - The United States is not on a "Safe list" of destinations for non-essential travel due to be unveiled by European Union governments later on Tuesday, three diplomats said.

The list must be passed by a "Qualified majority" of EU countries, meaning 15 EU countries representing 65% of the population.

## ‘Overwhelming majority’ of rapists going free because of collapse in prosecutions, campaigners warn - Only 1.5% of rapes recorded by police in England and Wales were prosecuted in 2019

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rape-prosecution-prison-sentence-police-cps-court-a9592186.html):

> The "Overwhelming majority" of rapists are walking free because of a collapse in prosecutions in England and Wales, campaigners have warned. Rape Crisis is among the signatories of a letter to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, amid an "End-to-end-review" of how rape cases are handled in the criminal justice system. "We continue to be inundated with inquiries from rape victims who have been told by the CPS that their cases will not be prosecuted, despite compelling evidence and the risk that dangerous men will feel free to offend again," she added.

## WHO says 'we cannot let our guard down' after China pigs study

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-pigs-who-idUSKBN2411DC):

> GENEVA - The World Health Organization will "Read carefully" a Chinese study on a new flu virus found in pigs, a spokesman said on Tuesday, saying the findings underscored the importance of influenza surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. A new flu virus found in Chinese pigs has become more infectious to humans and needs to be watched closely in case it becomes a potential "Pandemic virus", the study said. "It also highlights we cannot let our guard down on influenza and need to be vigilant and continue surveillance even in the coronavirus pandemic," he added.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-radiation-leak-appears-ignoring-iaea-un-watchdog-questions-2020-6):

> Russia is yet to respond to a request for information from the UN nuclear watchdog after it was accused of being behind a radiation leak in Scandinavia.

## A Massive Star Has Seemingly Vanished from Space With No Explanation: Astronomers are trying to figure out whether the star collapsed into a black hole without going supernova, or if it disappeared in a cloud of dust.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dyzyez/a-massive-star-has-seemingly-vanished-from-space-with-no-explanation):

> Astronomers are perplexed by the unexplained disappearance of a massive star located 75 million light years away. The weird disappearance of the massive star was so tantalizing that the European Southern Observatory, which manages the VLT, gave the team another shot to image the system with an instrument called X-Shooter. Another star appears to have fizzled out without any fireworks in a galaxy 22 million light years away, though it was only 25 times as massive as the Sun.

## Koalas will be driven to extinction before 2050 in New South Wales, major inquiry finds - State parliamentary investigation finds biggest threat to the species’ survival is habitat loss – but logging and clearing has continued

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/koalas-will-be-driven-to-extinction-by-2050-in-nsw-major-inquiry-finds):

> Koalas will become extinct before 2050 in NSW unless there is urgent government intervention to prevent habitat loss, a year-long inquiry has found. The NSW parliamentary inquiry also finds that a government estimate that there are 36,000 koalas in the state is outdated and unreliable. "The report found that habitat loss and fragmentation was the biggest threat to koalas, yet at every turn we were handed evidence that showed our current laws are inadequate and facilitating the clearing of core koala habitat."The strategies and policies currently in place to protect the koala aren't working, like the NSW Koala Strategy, which fails in ensuring enough koala habitat is protected for the different koala populations across the state.

## German officials were so alarmed by Trump's conversations with Angela Merkel that they took extra steps to make sure they stayed secret, according to a CNN report

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/german-officials-alarmed-trump-merkel-call-conversations-cnn-report-2020-6):

> German officials were so alarmed by President Donald Trump's "Very aggressive" conversations with Chancellor Angela Merkel that they kept their calls secret, sources told CNN. In calls with the German chancellor, Trump reportedly bullied and disparaged Merkel in a "Near-sadistic" fashion, according to the CNN report by Carl Bernstein, a longtime journalist known for his reporting on the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post. The group of officials assigned to monitor Merkel's calls with Trump also diminished in size, leaving "Just a small circle of people who are involved and the reason, the main reason, is that they are indeed problematic," a German official told CNN. The official added that the conversations between Trump and Merkel were deemed "So unusual" that extra steps were taken to keep the calls secret. "President Trump is a world-class negotiator who has consistently furthered America's interests on the world stage," White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said in a statement to Business Insider, in response to the CNN report.
