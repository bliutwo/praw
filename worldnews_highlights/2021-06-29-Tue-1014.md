## Canada Has Added More US Far-Right Extremists To Its List Of Banned Terrorists

Summary of [original article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/canada-terror-three-percenters):

> Canada's government on Friday added more American neo-Nazis to its list of banned terrorist groups, yet another sign that the country is going further than the United States when it comes to recognizing such white supremacist extremists as threats. In the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol, Canada moved to declare four far-right or white supremacist groups as terrorist entities, marking the first time it had listed such groups. The absence of specific laws outlining domestic terrorism is one reason the US hasn't gone as far as Canada in designating US and foreign extremist groups as terrorist entities.

> >Designating a group or individual as a “terrorist entity” under Canadian federal law makes it illegal for people to join and collaborate with the groups. It also grants the government the power to freeze the assets of people involved with the groups and charge anyone who financially or materially supports them. It can also make it easier for authorities to get online content posted by the banned extremists removed.

## UN report accuses Israel of ‘grave violations’ against children

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-report-accuses-israel-of-grave-violations-against-children/):

> The report also accused Israel of killing eight Palestinian children in the West Bank and one Israeli boy, who died in a car crash while he was fleeing from Israel police. Despite an intensive multi-year campaign by a consortium of NGOs called the 1612 Watchlist on Children to have it listed in the report's annex, the IDF is not seen as a grave violator and Israel is not under the MRM. The Syrian government is one of the regional actors listed as a grave violator, as are armed Sunni and Shiite terrorists organizations in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan and Iraq. "Because the reporting on Israel is largely reported by radical anti-Israel NGOs," argued Herzberg, "That blind themselves to violation by Palestinian terror groups, the report does not accurately capture violations against children by Palestinians and therefore the UN response is going to be inadequate to remedy violations against children in conflict."

## A baby gorilla has been born in the wild in Gabon from two parents who grew up in captivity in Europe, in a world-first that has delighted conservationists of the endangered species

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210629-captive-bred-gorillas-give-birth-in-the-wild-zoo):

> A baby gorilla has been born in the wild in Gabon from two parents who grew up in captivity in Europe, in a world-first that has delighted conservationists of the endangered species, the zoos announced on Tuesday. "Male gorillas have a role to play in the development of their offspring. We're looking at the creation of a new troop here which will be boosted by the reintroduction of another female who was born in England," Delord said. The Aspinall Foundation, set up by conservationist John Aspinall in the 1970s, says it has released eight black rhino, 135 primates, 11 European bison, and over 70 western lowland gorillas back to the wild.

## 'Historic day for freedoms' as Mexico decriminalises marijuana for personal use

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-29/mexico-supreme-court-decriminalises-marijuana-for-personal-use/100252604):

> "The right to free development of the personality is consolidated in the case of recreational or recreational use of marijuana." Medicinal marijuana use has been legal in Mexico since 2017 and is allowed in a number of other Latin American countries. The bill approved by the lower house in March would permit recreational use of marijuana, but establish a system of licences required for the entire chain of production, distribution, transformation and sales.
