## China adopts law against food waste; binge eating, excessive leftovers to face fines

Summary of [original article](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222490.shtml):

> China officially adopted a law against food waste on Thursday, banning binge-eating videos and excessive leftovers, which observers said will foster a resource-conserving and environmentally-friendly society. Observers noted that adoption of the legislation against food waste does not imply that China is facing an immediate food shortage risk, but it is a far-sighted move for food security as the country seeks to stabilize domestic grain output and ensure supply, facing increasing domestic demand for grain due to population growth and external uncertainties. Zheng Fengtian, a professor at Renmin University of China's School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development, told the Global Times that the legislation will guide enterprises, consumers and governments in the food industry chain in how to tackle severe waste problems in a legal manner, using either penalties or awards to regulate food waste.

> This is obviously targeted against [mukbangs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE6h2sdDBh4), videos of people eating massive amounts of food that have been gaining popularity in Asia. This is not about controlling what people eat in their homes privately.

## Antarctic ‘doomsday glacier’ may be melting faster than was thought

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/30/antarctic-doomsday-glacier-may-be-melting-faster-than-was-thought):

> An Antarctic glacier larger than the UK is at risk of breaking up after scientists discovered more warm water flowing underneath it than previously thought. The fate of Thwaites - nicknamed the doomsday glacier - and the massive west Antarctic ice sheet it supports are the biggest unknown factors in future global sea level rise. Because a lot of the ground on which the glacier sits is below sea level, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to melting as warmer water encroaches further under the ice inland.

> “Large” glacier just doesn’t carry the same *impact* as “doomsday” glacier...

> So, in other words, they are saying that their only purpose is to stick around so that the country is never free from foreign military forces, as it is the ONLY reason they exist at all.. To their supporters, this should be direct evidence of them not caring at all about the "liberation of the country", they are only in it to create conflict. Usually insurgencies at least claim they are in it to stop war, The Base just said they are in it for the chaos and death.

## Belarus: 2008 Olympic medalist on 10-day hunger strike, sells medal, in protest of jailing of 100s for political views

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/belarusian-athlete-stages-hunger-strike-support-jailed-compatriots-2021-04-30/):

> To support those behind bars and aid their families, the 2008 Olympic silver medallist has started a 10-day hunger strike and is auctioning his gold medal from the 2011 European indoor championships. "I had some kind of internal urge to do this because the repression isn't subsiding," Krauchanka, 35, told Reuters, days after starting his hunger strike this week. Krauchanka, who said he had lost six kg in the first three days of his hunger strike, won the heptathlon gold medal at the 2011 European indoor championships despite acute pain from his torn Achilles.
