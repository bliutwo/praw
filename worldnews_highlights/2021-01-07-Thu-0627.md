> Shares blame? He straight up TOLD the crowd to March on the Capitol. He TOLD them to overturn the peaceful transition of power to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. He also told them that he would be there with them, but yeah, that was a lie. Oh Yeah, then after these insurrectionists invaded the Capitol building he sent them a little love note on Twitter, praising his â€˜special peopleâ€™.

> Wednesday was fucking nuts.

## New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern: Democracy "should never be undone by a mob"

Summary of [original article](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/123890446/jacinda-ardern-on-us-capitol-riot-democracy-should-never-be-undone-by-a-mob):

> There were shocking scenes of violence and mobs rampaging through the halls that are supposed to be the bastion of democracy, and they ricocheted around the United States and across the world. "Rest assured, our democracy & institutions are strong and resilient," Covert said. Former US ambassador to New Zealand Scott Brown left the role in December.

> Fun fact about NZ: after unpopular political outcomes, they reformed their electoral system.
> 
> In NZ, you vote for a local representative. You *also* vote for a party. If at the end of the election, parties aren't proportionally represented, they add seats until they are.
> 
> So if a party gets 5% of the vote, they get 5% of the voice in parliament.
> 
> If your democracy is at times feeling like it does not represent the people, that you're ever forced to select the lessor of just two evils, [mixed-member proportional](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) is well worth looking in to.

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7559368/canada-pro-trump-rallies-us-capitol-lockdown/amp/):

> Small rallies backing outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump broke out in several Canadian cities Wednesday, as a riotous mob occupied the U.S. Capitol in an effort to disrupt the certification of president-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory. The convoy moved on from the Consulate by 4:30 p.m. ET. In Vancouver, about two dozen demonstrators with Trump and Canadian flags gathered at the Vancouver Art Gallery North Plaza. The Canadian rallies came as law enforcement struggled to regain control of the U.S. Capitol building, which was locked down after pro-Trump demonstrators smashed windows and flowed inside following a speech from President Donald Trump.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-immigration-vaccines-idUSKBN29B2IN?taid=5ff60e92224979000124d2d3&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter):

> 3 Min Read.MEXICO CITY - Mexico's president said on Wednesday he was ready to provide coronavirus vaccines to undocumented migrants in the United States, after the governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska said they would likely not get vaccinated due to immigration status. "It's a universal right. We would do it," President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular government news conference when asked if Mexico would vaccinate undocumented migrants in the United States, many of which are Mexican nationals. The comments on Tuesday about workers at Nebraska's meat-packing plants by state governor Pete Ricketts, a member of President Donald Trump's Republican party, had provoked criticism from public health and migrant advocates.

> PR stunt from the piece of shit. Can't even finish vaccinating all hospital personnel.
