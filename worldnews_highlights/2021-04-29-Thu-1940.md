> I don't think putin's ever seriously dealt with a dude whose sole purpose in life and death was to punish him before.
> Most of the time, threats of death work on people and you can easily(ish) control them through fear.
> 
> but every once in a while your aggressive domination backfires horrifically and creates a single sick magnificent bastard who just wants you to pay and will gladly toss his life in a furnace if it means fucking you as hard as possible. Not because he hates you specifically, but because you represent to him an intolerable state of existence, a future dominated by one man, where people are controlled through fear. animal husbandry for humanity.
> 
> and this one person, putin isn't equipped to handle him. he can't kill him now, he can't break him, he could permanently cripple the guy and turn him into a vegetable and that still won't stop him.
> Putin has created the purest, most natural nemesis to dictators everywhere.
> 
> He's created a psychotically brave man, a man who'll stop at nothing to no-sale putin for the good of his country. even if his own views are misaligned his will can't be questioned. Nalvany is going to win, solely because putin doesn't know how to defeat a man who knows no fear of death or torture.

## Pope Francis issues law that forbids Vatican employees from accepting gifts over $48

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-issues-law-that-forbids-vatican-employees-accepting-gifts-over-48-1587464):

> In an effort to cut down on corruption among Vatican employees, Pope Francis instituted a new policy that prohibits them from receiving any work-related gift with a value over 40 euros. The "Work-related" qualifier will likely be open to interpretation, but the new rule is aimed at cutting back on the lavish gifts that Vatican employees are accustomed to receiving. Francis has spoken about the need to clean up corruption for eight years, but the new law represents the biggest step taken to ensure those who work at the Vatican are in the clear.

> That's the conversion from 40 Euros if anyone was wondering why the weird number.

## Taiwan bans recruitment from China to combat chip talent poaching

Summary of [original article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Taiwan-bans-recruitment-from-China-to-combat-chip-talent-poaching):

> TAIPEI - Taiwan has told staffing companies to remove all listings for jobs in China, a drastic move to prevent the outflow of vital tech talent to the mainland amid rising tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan's biggest recruitment platform, 104 Job Bank, told clients in a letter Wednesday to "Please close your job vacancies in China as soon as possible to avoid violating the law," citing the ministry notice. Taiwan has been intensifying efforts to prevent talent, especially in semiconductors, from flowing to China.

## Flu Has Disappeared Worldwide during the COVID Pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic/):

> The U.S. saw about 600 deaths from influenza during the 2020-2021 flu season. Because each year's flu vaccine is based on strains that have been circulating during the past year, it is unclear how next year's vaccine will fare, should the typical patterns of the disease return. The WHO made its flu strain recommendations for vaccines in late February as usual, but they were based on far fewer cases than in a common year.

`/u/Jay_Rizzle_Dizzle` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n1i01l/flu_has_disappeared_worldwide_during_the_covid/):

> Isn’t it strange that while we are mostly all
> Isolating, wearing masks and being serious about hand washing that the common flu stops spreading.
> Conspiracy nuts are claiming firstly that the lockdowns don’t work and that “evil doctors” are claiming that the sniffles is corona.
> The reality is, the lockdowns and masks that you lot claim to not work, actually works quite well and here is the evidence.
> There is no cabal of evil doctors trying to trick you into believing corona, stop being idiots.

## World will lose 10% of glacier ice even if it hits climate targets

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/29/world-lose-glacier-ice-climate-targets):

> A tenth of the world's mountain glacier ice will have melted by the middle of this century even if humanity meets the goals of the Paris climate agreement, according to figures compiled exclusively for the Guardian. Mountain glacier melt contributes more than a third of sea-level rise, a higher contribution than the Antarctic, according to the latest European State of the Climate Report, which was released last week. Scientists predict there could even be more glaciers in the world by 2050 because many of the current big bodies of ice will split into smaller fragments, but they stress the number and area of glaciers is less important than the trends affecting mass and volume over decades.

`/u/Memory_Less` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n11rp1/world_will_lose_10_of_glacier_ice_even_if_it_hits/):

> F^#*k! Wake up political representatives and stop playing politics and start collaborating like our lives depend on it. It does!
