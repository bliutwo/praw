> BERLIN - Germany has rejected a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the Group of Seven most advanced economies, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a newspaper interview published on Monday. Maas told Rheinische Post that he did not see any chance for allowing Russia back into the G7 as long as there was no meaningful progress in solving the conflict in Crimea as well as in eastern Ukraine. Russia itself could make the biggest contribution to becoming part of the G7 format again by contributing to a peaceful solution in the Ukraine conflict, Maas said.

## Chinese mogul expelled from party after calling Xi Jinping a 'clown,' accused of corruption

Summary of [original article](https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinese-mogul-expelled-calling-president-clown):

> A Chinese real estate mogul has been expelled from the Communist Party after he called President Xi Jinping "a clown," with the party bringing charges of corruption against him. The party accused Ren of "Distorting party history" and showing disloyalty and dishonesty to the party. Ren has long been considered a symbol of dissent from Xi, regularly voicing his opinions on the government and party operations, and some believe that he is being used as an example to show that no one is above loyalty to the party.

`/u/Faunstein` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hy3prg/chinese_mogul_expelled_from_party_after_calling/):

> To be fair they could probably all be sentenced for one form of corruption or another.
