> So they want the anti-corona measures to end. And their chosen strategy is .... torching a testing facillity. Thereby potentially setting back progress, and definitely inhibiting future progress at least somewhat, making the whole damn pandemic last that much longer.
> 
> I mean, I'm not exactly sure a curfew actually helps either, but man, talk about a self-defeating path of action.

> Remember that Obama, with the help of other countries, got a nuclear treaty with Iran with a [159 page detailed plan](https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1651/) and an inspections team on the ground in Iran to verify that Iran is complying with the deal.  Trump eventually pulled out of this deal.

> In his summit with North Korea, Trump got a [1 page vague signed statement by North Korea](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/read-full-text-of-trump-kim-signed-statement/index.html) regarding nuclear disarmament with no details, and it was vague enough that North Korea can interpret the statement as it suits them. And of course, there are no inspections team on the ground in North Korea.

> Trump is the worst deal maker.  Trump would never get a nuclear treaty with 159 pages of detail and an inspections team on the ground in North Korea.  Kim Jong Un, however, got a nice photo op with an American President, something that North Korea has always wanted, for practically nothing.

## Frequent New York Times Opinion Writer Was Secret Iranian Agent, Federal Prosecutors Charge

Summary of [original article](https://www.algemeiner.com/2021/01/20/frequent-new-york-times-opinion-writer-was-secret-iranian-agent-federal-prosecutors-charge/):

> A press release from the Department of Justice announcing the unsealing of a criminal complaint in the case says, "Since at least 2007 to the present, Afrasiabi has also been secretly employed by the Iranian government and paid by Iranian diplomats assigned to the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations in New York City. Afrasiabi has been paid approximately $265,000 in checks drawn on the IMUN's official bank accounts since 2007 and has received health insurance through the IMUN's employee health benefit plans since at least 2011.". Perhaps if Afrasiabi had been more transparent about his Iranian government connections, he might have been even more successful in getting published by the New York Times. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, had a byline on at least seven Times op-ed pieces between 2003 and 2017, four of them between 2015 and 2017, prompting at least some wry speculation that the Times editors will give the Iranian diplomat a Peter Beinart-style promotion to "Contributing opinion writer" status.

## Biden administration to unveil more climate policies, urges China to toughen emissions target

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29S0PA):

> 3 Min Read.WASHINGTON - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration next week will release more policies it believes are needed to tackle climate change and is urging China to toughen one of its targets on greenhouse gas emissions, his top climate advisers said on Saturday. A memo seen by Reuters on Thursday showed Biden will unveil a second round of executive orders as soon as Jan. 27 that include an omnibus order to combat climate change domestically and elevate the issue as a national security priority. John Kerry, Biden's special climate envoy, said a recent pledge by China, the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, was "Not good enough." In September, Chinese President Xi Xingping set a goal for his country to become carbon neutral by 2060, 10 years after the 2050 time frame favored by most countries, while also pledging a more ambitious short-term goal on emissions.

`/u/Express_Hyena` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/l40fjf/biden_administration_to_unveil_more_climate/):

> For durable climate policy, Congress needs to pass legislation. Executive orders signed by the president are limited in scope and are easily reversible. For example, all Obama-era greenhouse gas regulations had the [equivalent effect](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/mit-sloan-study-finds-modest-carbon-tax-achieves-same-reductions-obama-era-regulations) of a $7 carbon price, which is a small fraction of [what's needed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0880-3). So while it's a time for optimism on climate, we can't look to Biden to solve this by himself. Subs like [r/CitizensClimateLobby](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizensClimateLobby/) and [r/ClimateOffensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/) are working to pass durable bipartisan climate legislation that won't be as subject to the political pendulum.

## Scotland will hold independence referendum if SNP wins in May, says Sturgeon

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/24/scotland-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon-snp-wins-may-):

> Nicola Sturgeon has said she will hold an advisory referendum on independence if her Scottish National party wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections, regardless of whether Westminster consents to the move. Scotland's first minister told BBC One's Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning: "I want to have a legal referendum, that's what I'm going to seek the authority of the Scottish people for in May and if they give me that authority that's what I intend to do: to have a legal referendum to give people the right to choose. That's democracy. It's not about what I want or what Boris Johnson wants." Sturgeon told Marr: "The polls now show that a majority of people in Scotland want independence. If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months' time on proposition of giving the people that choice, then what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?".

`/u/limitless__` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/l3yka0/scotland_will_hold_independence_referendum_if_snp/):

> Here's the thing.  Scotland is more interested in being part of the EU than the UK.  When the English voted to leave the EU, Scotland did not. Ireland does JUST FINE being in the EU but not the UK.  Scotland can be the same way.

> 2 Min Read.BERLIN - The European Union should punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the arrest of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and thousands of his supporters with targeted financial sanctions, the leader of the bloc's largest political alliance said on Sunday. A German government spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether Berlin was willing to support new sanctions against Russia following Navalny's arrest. EU lawmakers passed a resolution on Thursday calling for the bloc to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a response to Navalny's arrest.
