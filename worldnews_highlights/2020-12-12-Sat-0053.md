## Argentina lower house approves landmark bill to legalize abortion

`/u/XyloArch` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kb1yhz/argentina_lower_house_approves_landmark_bill_to/):

> "Voting to legalize abortion" should be thought of as "voting for the state to intervene to make abortions safe for the mother". 
> 
> Abortions happen whether they are illegal or not, this is a fact. Making them illegal only makes them way more dangerous because of back-street or even self-administered procedures.
> 
> Everyone in the world wants to minimize the total number of abortions and minimize harm. Ideally no abortions would ever need to happen, but this is simply not realistic. At all. Promoting the use of contraception, making contraception free and very accessible, and making abortions legal and safe and accessible are the absolute best ways to minimize the number of abortions and minimize harm to women. 
> 
> If you're in the no-abortions-ever camp then I genuinely respect your position. I totally see the argument that says abortions are a red line that cannot be crossed, even if I disagree. However you then *have* to be pro-contraception because *that is how you minimize the need for abortions*. If you are anti-abortion, anti-contraception, and hence, presumably, pro-abstinence, then you are being hilariously, dangerously unrealistic.
