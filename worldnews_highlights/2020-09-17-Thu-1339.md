Following the incident, Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh faced an angry backlash and calls for his resignation after suggesting the rape was partially the victim's fault. In a television interview on Monday, the prime minister said that he had discussed punishment options with his cabinet for such cases.

> This title made me think the mother of the prime minister of Pakistan was gang raped, but it was just a woman who happened to be a mother. Obviously still awful but the title is super misleading.

## Putin will try to kill Navalny again and the West will do little about it, NATO sources say

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-will-kill-alexei-navalny-nato-2020-9):

> They also concluded that for now, Navalny is under the impression that the failure to kill him in Siberia will make it more difficult for Putin to try again. "There is some disagreement over whether it is possible that Putin did not directly order the attack but rather it was an initiative undertaken by his henchmen. But the presence of Novichok - which is made in a strictly controlled military lab - convinces me that Putin had to authorize it himself. There's a concern in some NATO circles [about] what it might mean if Russian officials decided to use a nerve agent on their most high profile dissident without Putin's formal approval, this is possible but in my opinion this is unlikely." "Putin is ruthless and but never stupid or rash. If Navalny returns to Russia he will face massive harassment and possibly arrest. This is how Putin ties up domestic opponents with a neverending stream of lawsuits, tax investigations, arrests on ludicrous charges. This will keep Navalny busy for years but eventually Putin is likely to decide that as Nord Stream becomes complete that the West, which he sees as greedy and weak, will probably not respond in a manner that really hurts him. The moment he makes that calculation - and of course he will never indicate he's made it, we will just know because Navalny is dead - then it will just be about finding a time or opportunity that suits him."

## Navalny team says nerve agent was found on hotel room water bottle

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny/navalny-team-says-nerve-agent-was-found-on-hotel-room-water-bottle-idUSKBN2680X0):

> 4 Min Read.MOSCOW - The nerve agent used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting he was poisoned there and not at the airport as first thought, his team said on Thursday. A video posted on Navalny's Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on Aug. 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances. "Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room," the post said.
