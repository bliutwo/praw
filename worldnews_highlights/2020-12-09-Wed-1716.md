Pfizer and BioNTech said they did not believe any personal data of trial participants had been compromised and EMA "Has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review." The two companies said they had been informed by the EMA "That the agency has been subject to a cyber attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine candidate ... had been unlawfully accessed."

> Stealing the recipe for the vaccine doesn't do much if a country doesn't have the facilities to produce that vaccine.
> 
> I don't doubt China or Russia has the capacity to build those facilities but most countries don't. Then there's the problem of transporting and keeping the vaccine in ultra cold storage.

> El Home Office es una modalidad laboral que se volvió indispensable ante la pandemia por el Covid-19; sin embargo, las condiciones laborales no siempre fueron respetadas y surgieron varias quejas de trabajadores al respecto. En la sesión del martes, legisladores de San Lázaro aprobaron una reforma a la Ley Federal del Trabajo, en materia de teletrabajo, misma que fue devuelta al Senado para ser analizada y, en su caso, darle 'luz verde' y sea una realidad. De acuerdo a datos de la CEPAL entre el primer y segundo trimestre de 2020, el tráfico de sitios web y usos de aplicaciones relacionadas con el teletrabajo en el mundo, aumentó 324 por ciento. Igualmente, se establecen obligaciones especiales para los trabajadores, como el cuidado, guarda y conservación de los insumos proporcionados para realizar sus labores; respetar las disposiciones en materia de seguridad y salud en el trabajo, y la protección de datos utilizados en el desempeño de sus actividades.
