`/u/juanTressel` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k75v7e/argentina_has_passed_a_new_tax_on_its_wealthiest/):

> This tax doesn't include people who have tax residency abroad and have their property and wealth abroad, which is the majority of Argentina's wealthiest people. [Including the late Diego Maradona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3I0_2r67T0).
> 
> Argentina [*already has* a wealth tax](https://www.afip.gob.ar/gananciasYBienes/bienes-personales/conceptos-basicos/que-es.asp) for wealths in excess of ARS 3 million (USD 37000 using the official exchange rate, USD 20700 using the blue-chip rate), paying from 0.5% up to 1.25% of the total person's worth (not *net* worth: it doesn't take debts into account). 
> 
> I'm sure the sophomoric Reddit userbase will side with this tax regardless of how it was implemented because "tax the rich" is enough for them, but considering that this new wealth tax not only taxes illiquid assets but also doesn't take into account passives (debt incurred), this could end up being a disaster for businesses, even medium-size businesses: the lowest rate will require to pay ARS 4 million, which few people have *in cash*. They will have to liquidate assets, which will directly impact private investment at a time in which unemployment nears the record 25% rate of 2002. [It has been featured](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/jxztxf/argentinas_new_wealth_tax_is_bad_economics/) in /r/badeconomics for these reasons.

## 'Havana Syndrome' likely caused by microwave energy, government study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/havana-syndrome-likely-caused-microwave-energy-government-study-finds-n1250094):

> The mysterious neurological symptoms experienced by American diplomats in China and Cuba are consistent with the effects of directed microwave energy, according to a long-awaited report by the National Academies of Sciences that cites medical evidence to support the long-held conviction of American intelligence officials. The report, obtained Friday by NBC News, does not conclude that the directed energy was delivered intentionally, by a weapon, as some U.S. officials have long believed. The study examined four possibilities to explain the symptoms: Infection, chemicals, psychological factors and microwave energy.

`/u/JonnyArena` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k7cx8l/havana_syndrome_likely_caused_by_microwave_energy/):

> "...Russian intelligence agents who had worked on microwave weapons programs were present in the same cities at the same time that CIA officers suffered mysterious symptoms."

## World's four largest space agencies published 20 studies on Nov. 25 investigating genetic, biochemical and physiological changes in 56 astronauts, making it the largest study of astronauts to date. “It’s a turning point in space biology and aerospace medicine"

Summary of [original article](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/12/studies-offers-tips-lessening-spaceflight-related-risk):

> Space travel, illnesses like COVID-19 and climbing Mount Everest can trigger the body's stress response systems in similar ways, according to new studies by Weill Cornell Medicine, space agencies and other investigators. Christopher Mason, an associate professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine, led multiple studies by teams of investigators spanning four of the largest space agencies in the world - NASA; the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; the European Space Agency; and Russia's ROSCOSMOS - as well as academic institutions and industry groups. An immune system protein called interleukin-6 was heavily activated in both COVID-19 patients and astronauts, as well as many genes related to the immune system.
