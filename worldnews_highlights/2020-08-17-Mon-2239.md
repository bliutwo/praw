## Tonnes of dead fish cleaned from French river after Nestlé spill: 'A spectacle of desolation'

Summary of [original article](https://observers.france24.com/en/20200817-france-tonnes-dead-fish-river-nestle-spill):

> Thousands of fish were found dead on the banks and in the Aisne river near Brécy-Brières in northeastern France on August 10. On August 12, the Ardennes Fishing Federation sounded a call for volunteers to help clean the dead fish from the river. According to the Prefecture of Ardennes, the death of the fish occurred due to a decrease of oxygen in the water, but an investigation is ongoing by the French Bioversity Office and gendarmerie to determine if any chemical pollution played a part in the death of the fish.

## Canada will not accept ‘fraudulent’ elections in Belarus, says foreign minister

Summary of [original article](https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2020/08/17/canada-will-not-accept-fraudulent-elections-in-belarus-says-foreign-minister/):

> Canada does not accept the results of the Aug. 9 "Fraudulent" presidential election in Belarus and calls for "Free and fair elections," Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Monday as tens of thousands of Belarusians marched to demand the resignation of President Alexander Lukashenko. "We do not accept the results of this fraudulent presidential election in Belarus and call for free and fair elections." Many Russia watchers say, while Putin might be willing to extract further concessions from Belarus on the union, he is not in a hurry to invade Belarus to prop up Lukashenko.

## Facebook algorithm found to 'actively promote' Holocaust denial

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/facebook-algorithm-found-to-actively-promote-holocaust-denial):

> An investigation by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK-based counter-extremist organisation, found that typing "Holocaust" in the Facebook search function brought up suggestions for denial pages, which in turn recommended links to publishers which sell revisionist and denial literature, as well as pages dedicated to the notorious British Holocaust denier David Irving. Researchers found that when they followed public Facebook pages containing Holocaust denial content, Facebook recommended further similar content. "Jacob Davey, ISD's senior research manager, said:"Facebook's decision to allow Holocaust denial content to remain on its platform is framed under the guise of protecting legitimate historical debate, but this misses the reason why people engage in Holocaust denial in the first place.

> I think this has more to do with FB's incentive to push controversial content than specific anti-semitic bias

"We held elections already. Until you kill me, there will be no other elections," he was quoted by Belarusian media as saying during a visit to a tractor plant Monday morning.

## Iran paid bounties for targeting US troops, intelligence reportedly suggests

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/512273-iran-paid-bounties-for-targeting-us-troops-intelligence-reportedly-suggests):

> U.S. intelligence reportedly indicates Iran's government offered bounties to Taliban fighters to target U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan. While the government in question is classified in the memo, two sources familiar with the intelligence told the network it was in reference to Iran. The briefing document stated that the Bagram attack likely qualified for compensation from the foreign government "Based on the nature of the attack and agreed upon bounties." Although U.S. intelligence said the Haqqani network had reason to target the base without a financial motivator, CNN noted that the document states the alleged funding "Probably incentivizes future high-profile attacks on US and Coalition forces."

`/u/CAESTULA` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ibcugv/iran_paid_bounties_for_targeting_us_troops/):

> You're fucking kidding me right? This is like, general knowledge in the military. We captured tons of Iranian equipment and weapons in Iraq, and captured enemy routinely told us they were trained and paid by Iran. Iranian forces have paid bounties on US troops in Iraq for *years.* I know first hand, because I was there and physically captured some of these people and they not only told us, but they had Iranian weapons and the like. Part of my job was to interrogate these guys and pass the information up.

The Quds Force is an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
