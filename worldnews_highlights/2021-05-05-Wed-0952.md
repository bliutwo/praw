> I think the most shocking statistic is that 71% of Chinese citizens are content with the level of democracy in their country, compared to 33% in Russia and 31% in Hungary. Also the fact that a think tank funded by western governments would say that

## Chinese man seeking ‘freedom and equality’ says he travelled to Taiwan in dinghy

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/04/chinese-man-seeking-freedom-and-equality-says-he-travelled-to-taiwan-in-dinghy):

> A Chinese man seeking "Freedom and equality" has said he travelled undetected to Taiwan in a dinghy through the heavily patrolled Taiwan strait, according to authorities. The 180km journey took about 10 hours, they said, through the highly militarised Taiwan Strait, which is patrolled by both Taiwanese and Chinese authorities. Taiwan has amended laws to decriminalise the act of arriving unlawfully to seek political asylum but has no dedicated refugee program, case review process or streamlined support service in Taiwan.

## Philippines rejects China fishing ban and wards off Chinese vessels

`/u/wizardofthefuture` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n56aca/philippines_rejects_china_fishing_ban_and_wards/):

> For anyone who's not familiar, what China is doing is basically as if they were to show up on California's coast with a naval militia and then issue a ban on Americans using our own waters. Except instead of California, it's happening to the Philippines, which is rightfully rejecting what *looks* from the outside like the first step in an attempt at colonization.
> 
> Worse yet, China is issuing these bans to other countries as well... within the exclusive territorial waters belonging to those countries. Wherever you're from, imagine China just showing up and taking your favorite body of water while telling you that your people are now banned from using it. Imagine China taking all of your favorite islands, too. If they're willing to do that and genuinely don't recognize your country's rights, then what else are they willing to do?
> 
> We should hope the world comes together to protect these countries. Territorial waters are a country's right, and China doesn't get to erase that right.

## Ukraine starts closing gap with Russia; real income almost doubles since 2018

Summary of [original article](https://intellinews.com/datacrunch-ukraine-starts-to-close-the-gap-with-russia-209626):

> Russia and Ukraine are both emerging from the coronacrisis and have had very similar experiences, but as the recovery gets under way Ukraine is beginning to close the gap with Russia. Russia dwarfs Ukraine in almost every way, but given its size it should be pulling ahead of Ukraine as some sort of normality returns and it is not - at least on some scores. Average income in January 2018 in Ukraine was $272 per month against Russia's $679. Two years on, and in February the average wage in Ukraine has almost doubled to $490, whereas in Russia incomes are up only $10 over the last two years to $689. The rising incomes in Ukraine are feeding into the retail sector, which is one of the big growth drivers, whereas Russia's retail was going backwards in March.

> They will soon overtake russia. 
> Ukraine is not perfect, but it is not politically and socially dead as russia is.
