> I understand how libel and slander works in broad strokes but when the subject of your article broadcasts that denial several times a day on at least 3 continents I think it’s safe to leave the word “claims” out of the goddamn headline.

## Declassified tapes reveal Richard Nixon's hate for Indians

Summary of [original article](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/they-are-a-scavenging-people-declassified-tapes-reveal-richard-nixons-hate-for-indians/articleshow/77927223.cms):

> By Gary J. Bass As Americans grapple with problems of racism and power, a newly declassified trove of White House tapes provides startling evidence of the bigotry voiced by President Richard M. Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser. The full content of these tapes reveal how U.S. policy toward South Asia under Mr. Nixon was influenced by his hatred of, and sexual repulsion toward, Indians. Mr. Nixon now asked what "Do the Indians have that takes even a Keating, for Christ, a 70-year-old" - here there is cross-talk, but the word seems to be "Bachelor" or "Bastard." In reply, Mr. Kissinger sweepingly explained: "They are superb flatterers, Mr. President. They are masters at flattery. They are masters at subtle flattery. That's how they survived 600 years. They suck up - their great skill is to suck up to people in key positions."

> Nixon recorded himself saying a mixed race baby was a reason for abortion, its not like he just felt that way, he was so certain of that belief he made a tape of him saying so. The question of if he was racist is answered.

## NATO calls for international response to Navalny poisoning

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/international/515105-nato-calls-for-international-response-to-navalny-poisoning):

> NATO on Friday called for the international community to respond to the attempted assassination of leading Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny and said that Moscow must cooperate with an independent investigation. Stoltenberg said that despite Navalny's attack taking place on Russian soil, the attempt on his life is a violation of international law and requires an international response. In response to a similar poisoning attack in 2018 on the Russian-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English town of Salisbury, NATO expelled seven Russian diplomats from their mission at the allied organization.

## Vitamin D deficiency raises COVID-19 infection risk by 77%, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/09/03/Vitamin-D-deficiency-raises-COVID-19-infection-risk-by-77-study-finds/7001599139929/):

> Sept. 3 - Vitamin D deficiency increases a person's risk for catching COVID-19 by 77% compared to those with sufficient levels of the nutrient, a study published Thursday by JAMA Network Open found. Vitamin D deficiency was found to increase the risk for testing positive for COVID-19 by 77%, while older age - which has been linked with higher risk for the disease - only raised the likelihood by 6%, the study showed. "Given that vitamin D deficiency is common, supplementation of vitamin D intake might reduce the likelihood of developing COVID-19.".

> Vitamin D deficiency is a surrogate marker for people who get little sunlight and advanced age. Vit D deficiency correlates with almost every bad medical condition.

## The number of mammoth skeletons found at Mexico City airport construction site raises to 200, making it the world's largest find of mammoth bones

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-04/mammoth-central-found-at-mexico-airport-construction-site):

> The number of mammoth skeletons recovered at an airport construction site north of Mexico City has risen to at least 200, with a large number still to be excavated, experts said Thursday. There are so many mammoths at the site of the new Santa Lucia airport that observers have to accompany each bulldozer that digs into the soil to make sure work is halted when mammoth bones are uncovered. The site near Mexico City now appears to have outstripped the Mammoth Site at Hot Springs, S.D. - which has about 61 sets of remains - as the world's largest find of mammoth bones.

`/u/tommeyrayhandley` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/imhs18/the_number_of_mammoth_skeletons_found_at_mexico/):

> Imagine the poor Mexican architect trying to build an airport weeping quietly at home as they pull yet another mammoth out of his dig site.
