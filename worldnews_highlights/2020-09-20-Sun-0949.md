## Hackers leak personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police on weekend of protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election/hackers-leak-personal-data-of-1000-belarusian-police-on-weekend-of-protests-idUSKCN26B09X?il=0):

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Anonymous hackers leaked the personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police officers in retaliation for a crackdown on street demonstrations against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko, as protesters geared up for another mass rally on Sunday. Security forces have detained thousands of people to tackle a wave of protests and strikes, their faces often obscured by masks, balaclavas or riot helmets. Lukashenko's crackdown on the protests has prompted the European Union to weigh fresh sanctions against his government.

> > “As the arrests continue, we will continue to publish data on a massive scale,” said a statement that was distributed by the opposition news channel Nexta Live on the messaging app Telegram. “No one will remain anonymous even under a balaclava.”
> 
> Edit: A note on the rewards on this post. A significant number of them come from accounts with no post or comment history. Given the current climate, and the proliferation of awards on rising posts, I felt this was worth disclosing and would again request that Reddit offer some transparency as to where money is entering the reward economy on this site during the upcoming US election season.

## Germany Ends Honeymoon with China; Will Trade More With Democratic Asian Nations

Summary of [original article](https://www.btimesonline.com/articles/139185/20200920/germany-ends-honeymoon-china-will-trade-more-democratic-asian-nations.htm):

> A disillusioned Germany is deemphasizing its close economic ties with China to do more business with liberal democracies that have more respect for the rule of law such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore. China currently accounts for almost 50 percent of Germany's total annual trade due to Germany's China-centric policies. Germany's decades-long infatuation with China was summed-up by the phrase, "Wandel durch Handel," or "Change through trade." In living-up to this maxim, Germany deluded itself into believing China's authoritarian and communist politics would somehow evolve into a free, open, and more democratic system through wider economic ties.

> This is very good. The world needs to not be dependent on China. Germany is a significant player Economicially.

## Bleach touted as 'miracle cure' for Covid being sold on Amazon

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/19/bleach-miracle-cure-amazon-covid):

> Industrial bleach is being sold on Amazon through its product pages which consumers are buying under the mistaken belief that it is a "Miracle cure" for Covid-19, despite health warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration that drinking the fluid can kill. Users discuss how many drops of bleach they are imbibing and explain they are drinking the chemical which they call MMS to "Disinfect ourselves", a phrase that echoes Donald Trump's controversial remarks in April that injections of disinfectant could cure Covid-19.One purchaser, writing in Spanish, said his family had started taking bleach soon after the coronavirus pandemic hit the US. "Many people still don't believe in it, but I am sure that it has helped us a lot," he said. Third-party sellers are still finding ways to peddle potentially dangerous products on the site Several deaths of people drinking bleach marketed as a "Miracle cure" have been reported across South America, including in Argentina where a five-year-old boy was reported to have died in August having been given chlorine dioxide as a Covid cure.

> You remember the old expression “we need a little more chlorine in this end of the gene pool”?
