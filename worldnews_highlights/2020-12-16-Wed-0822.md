## Saudi Arabia removes school textbook content that were considered antisemitic, homophobic, sexist, and anti-Israeli, including a unit that condemned homosexuality as something punishable by death.

Summary of [original article](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/saudi-arabia-text-book-revised-to-be-more-tolerant-study-652256):

> In a review of Saudi Arabia's 2020-2021 curriculum, many textbooks have been found to be revised, moving from previously extreme hate filled content to the direction of moderation, the research institute IMPACT-se found. "Examining the trendline of our 2002, 2008 and even 2019 reports of the Saudi curriculum, it is clear that these new 2020 textbooks represent an institutional effort to modernize the Kingdom's curriculum," Said IMPACT-se CEO, Marcus Sheff. "The Saudi authorities have begun a process of rooting out anti-Jewish hate, including a notorious Hadith that fueled antisemitism in the Muslim world."The report still states that moderation has been introduced and removed before, so while the change is present, more time is needed to determine whether or not it is permanent.

> ITT: people somehow salty that a country with an extensive history and practice of bigotry is taking steps to change that. 
> 
> Yes, I understand it’s terrible that’s been taught. But that’s been taught in the entire region and beyond for quite a while and is deeply culturally engrained. Removing this kind of stuff from textbooks is a big step towards changing those beliefs. 
> 
> You’re asking the country to run before it can crawl. You’re not going to get a country that stones people for homosexuality to be putting out pride flags and legalizing gay marriage just by telling them human rights abuses aren’t cool (and despite what you may think telling them we won’t by their oil until they do isn’t going to make a big impact either)
> 
> I get this kind of stuff shouldn’t be acceptable today. You’re right; they didn’t get the memo or didn’t care when they read it. Be happy they’re taking steps in the right direction, a victory is a victory and with how long the road is it should be celebrated.

## 'Ghost boat’ washes up in Marshall Islands with 649 kilos of cocaine on board

Summary of [original article](https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/ghost-boat-washes-up-in-marshall-islands-with-649-kilos-of-cocaine-on-board-9fd69c15-0591-4320-a4ce-209848d82232):

> Majuro, Marshall Islands - Marshall Islands police have found the Pacific nation's largest-ever haul of cocaine in an abandoned boat that washed up on a remote atoll after drifting on the high seas, potentially for years. There have been numerous other stashes of drugs found along the Marshall Islands' shoreline over the past two decades, including another one in Ailuk, but the latest haul was by far the largest. University of Hawaii researchers conducted 16 computer simulations of drift patterns from the Mexico coast and found nearly all eventually arrived in the Marshall Islands.
