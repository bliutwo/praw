Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9805889/Britain-defy-Beijing-sailing-warships-disputed-waters-South-China-Sea.html):

> Britain will sail an aircraft carrier taskforce through disputed international waters in the South China Sea in a direct challenge to Beijing, the Defence Secretary has revealed. After passing through the South China Sea in August, the British fleet will partake in exercises in the Philippines Sea with Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the US.Mr Wallace declined to say whether the fleet would breach the 12 mile zone around military bases China has built on disputed rocks in the South China Sea.US warships and aircraft have passed close to the bases in the past, provoking warnings from Chinese vessels and angry responses from Beijing. It will come to Japan through the South China Sea, parts of which are claimed by China and South East Asian countries after stops in India, Singapore and South Korea.

> There's an interesting international legal reason that this constantly happens in the South China Sea. Basically, in order to prevent China from taking sovereignty over the islands, the United States, the United Kingdom and other states that do not want China to have legal claim to the islands, must display that China does not have that sovereignty.
> 
> 
> China is attempting to declare a bunch of islands within the South China Sea to be its own territory, most people know this. The reason is the vast natural resource bed available as well as a geopolitically advantageous position. In order to do so it has made its own islands and occupied them which does not actually give it any rights over the surrounding waters according to the Law of the Sea Convention. However, it is also occupying natural islands in the area as well.
> 
> 
> According to the *Island of Palmas Case* (Netherlands v. United States) (1928), 2 RIAA 829, a state effectively occupies a territory when it is able to exert sovereignty over that territory, which in effect, actually leads to that sovereignty. Here is the major except from the case from page 839 of volume II of the UN report of international arbitration awards from 1928.
> 
> 
> > Titles of acquisition of territorial sovereignty in present-day international law are either based on an act of effective apprehension, such as occupation or conquest, or, like cession, presuppose that the ceding and the cessionary Powers or at least one of them, have the faculty of effectively disposing of the ceded territory. In the same way natural accretion can only be conceived of as an accretion to a portion of territory where there exists an actual sovereignty capable of extending to a spot which falls within its sphere of activity. It seems therefore natural that an element which is essential for the constitution of sovereignty should not be lacking in its continuation. So true is this, that practice, as well as doctrine, recognizes—though under different legal formulae and with certain differences as to the conditions required—that the continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty (peaceful in relation to other States) is as good as a title. The growing insistence with which international law, ever since the middle of the 18th century, has demanded that the occupation shall be effective would be inconceivable, if effectiveness were required only for the act of acquisition and not equally for the maintenance of the right. If the effectiveness has above all been insisted on in regard to occupation, this is because the question rarely arises in connection with territories in which there is already an established order of things. Just as before the rise of international law, boundaries of lands were necessarily determined by the fact that the power of a State was exercised within them, so too, under the reign of international law., the fact of peaceful and continuous display is still one of the most important considerations in establishing boundaries between States.

> 
> Which happens at least every few weeks. China asserts its sovereignty, and Western Powers in calling it international waters and airspace dispute that sovereignty. Every time a country successfully sails its ships through the area without China preventing that freedom of movement through international waters, its claim to the islands is weakened. So, when the US or UK or any other country attempts to sail its ships through the areas that China is claiming sovereignty to, it responds as if it actually has sovereignty over the area.
> 
> 
> These ships will also zig-zag through the waters so as to be very clear about the fact that they are not simply excercising their ability to briefly travel through the waters to get to their destination under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but rather do not see the waters as Chinese territorial waters. The operations are known in the United States as Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP).

> Really interesting example of international law!

"The most important thing is to counter this idea that there's such a thing as 'human rights with Chinese characteristics'."
