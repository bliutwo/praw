Fossil fuels – particularly coal. ‘Coal is the source of the problem in most parts of the world,’ Professor Michael Greenstone, co-author of the report, told the Guardian. ‘If these [health] costs were embedded in prices, coal would be uncompetitive in almost all parts of the world.’

> TOKYO - Japan's defence ministry said on Sunday that a submarine believed to be from China was spotted in waters near its southern islands, as maritime tensions persist in the Pacific. Japan's navy on Friday morning identified a submerged vessel sailing northwest just outside territorial waters near Amami Oshima island, part of Kagoshima prefecture, the ministry said in a statement. Saturday's announcement said Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force identified the vessels in a contiguous zone, which is outside territorial waters where vessels are required to identify themselves.

> China replies, probably: 
> 
> "those are our territorial waters and if you were close enough to see our submarine that means you were trespassing. This is further proof of historical Japanese antagonistic and war mongering behavior towards peaceful Chinese nation and we demand immediate apology"                     /s.

## Abandoning 60 Percent of Global Oil and Gas Might Limit Warming to 1.5 C

Summary of [original article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/abandoning-60-percent-of-global-oil-and-gas-might-limit-warming-to-1-5-c/):

> A new study published yesterday in the journal Nature found that 60 percent of oil and natural gas, and a whopping 90 percent of coal, must remain unextracted and unused between now and 2050 in order for the world to have at least a 50 percent shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Under the Paris climate agreement, nations are working to keep global temperatures within 2 C of their preindustrial levels, and within 1.5 C if at all possible. In the United States, the study suggests that 31 percent of oil reserves, 52 percent of natural gas and 97 percent of coal must stay in the ground.

## A new stratospheric Polar Vortex is forming over the North Pole, as the seasonal cooling begins. It will keep strengthening into December, influencing the 2021/2022 Winter season.

`/u/_tropical_tundra_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/pmkkrh/a_new_stratospheric_polar_vortex_is_forming_over/):

> Here’s the TLDR:
> 
> 1. The polar vortex is forming - as it does every year
> 2. The tropical equatorial winds are moving east until the end of the year
> 3. A warming event is expected to pull even more cold air down
> 4. The US, central and Northern Europe will be freezing their asses off. 
> 
> So store up on hot cocoa. (I may have added that, read the article to figure out if I did.)
> 
> ETA: for those of you who stopped reading at the paragraph where SSW collapses the vortex.  This isn’t actually a good thing.  Three or four paragraphs down from that statement the article continues:
> 
> “A Polar Vortex collapse is just as dynamic as it sounds, as the higher pressure comes crashing down, pushing the cold air out of the polar regions, into the United States and/or Europe.”
