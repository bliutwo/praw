> As a male I support them being free and think its ridiculous they are taxed as luxurious products in England...
> 
> Edit: honest mistake it’s not taxed as luxury and I was referring to Tesco’s battle to get them tax free, regarding the current accurate state of tax on them they are taxed in accordance with eu minimum tax rules but are in the slow process of being made tax free.
> 
> Note: rep Tescos for paying the 5% on them so women who buy them in Tesco’s don’t pay tax on period products!

> edit: I'm from Brooklyn and the game of "gunshots or fireworks" was pretty terrifying at first. When I realized they were actually aiming fireworks AT me, I had to resolve that everyone was a target and I wasn't going to be killed, maybe just injured. heh.

## 'Let's rebuild a strong EU-USA alliance', EU chiefs tell Joe Biden

Summary of [original article](https://www.euronews.com/2020/11/24/let-s-rebuild-a-strong-eu-usa-alliance-eu-chiefs-tell-joe-biden):

> European Union chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel heralded "a new beginning" of EU-US relations on Monday during phone conversations with President-elect Joe Biden. Earlier this month, Biden already spoke with several EU leaders including France's Emmanuel Macron, and Germany's Angela Merkel. "The last four years have been an enormous test of the transatlantic relationship. The fact that the majority of Germans expect normalisation under Joe Biden shows that the damage caused is not irreparable," Nora Muller, head of International Politics at the Korber Foundation, said on the survey's results.

> No one should go into any deals with us that last longer than the current presidents term unless those deals are ratified by congress and can't be undone by some lunatic we elect next.

## Nearly half of families forced into debt since start of pandemic, figures show

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/families-debt-poverty-children-uk-b1759318.html):

> Nearly half of families with children have been forced into some form of debt since the start of the pandemic, prompting warnings that Britain risks becoming a nation "Surviving on credit". New figures seen by The Independent show that almost 18 million people, a third of the population, have had to use credit cards, go into their overdraft or borrow from friends and family since March. The new findings from Turn2Us also show that people on furlough were considerably more likely to be borrowing money, with half of those who have been furloughed since March falling into debt, compared to 23 per cent of people who have seen no change to the employment.

## Swiss to vote on banning the funding of weapons makers.

> It seems a lot of people are not clear on what this vote is about. It's not about banning companies that make weapons. It's about not investing public money (from the National Bank, pension funds etc.) in weapons manufacturers.
> 
> It will be difficult to implement and control, and will hinder investments. Let's see if it passes.
