## Dominican Republic bans child marriage. 36% of Dominican girls were married before the age of 18, which is the highest rate in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 12% of unions, the bride was less than 15 years old.

Summary of [original article](https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2021/01/01/dominican-republic-bans-child-marriage/amp/):

The Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic ended 2020 with an approval of the bill that bans child marriage in the country, where girls from the age of 15 were previously allowed to marry.

## Policeman buys family food instead of arresting them for shoplifting

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-55522825):

> Somerset Police Department A US police officer who was called out to arrest a family suspected of shoplifting instead bought them some food so they could have a decent Christmas dinner. When questioned, the family said they had fallen upon hard times and could not afford to pay for all the food. He then bought them gift cards worth $250 with his own money so the women and their two children would be able to buy food for their Christmas dinner at another shop of the same chain.

`/u/rawautos` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kpmhwo/policeman_buys_family_food_instead_of_arresting/):

> An officer who took an oath to serve and protect the community goes out and does just that. I can’t believe I’m reading some of the comments saying this officer should be punished for not taking them to jail. There is grey area in the law, and this officer understands that. I applaud him for doing good for a family instead of causing a rift within the community.

> "We also call on the Australian authorities to intervene and get Zara home to safety." A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson has confirmed consular assistance is being provided to the Australian passport holder. "The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to an Australian in Tanzania."

`/u/agentyage` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kpdulh/australian_woman_who_renounced_islamic_faith_and/):

> Does the ABC regularly have headlines that would seem over the top at Fox News? Her arrest seems to have nothin to do with her being ex Muslim and everything to do with her pissing off a government by mocking their covid handling. It's a bullshit reason to arrest someone, but this headline is blatantly misleading and ginning up islamophobia for no reason.
