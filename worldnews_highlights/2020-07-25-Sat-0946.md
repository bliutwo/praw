## Coronavirus: Israeli court rules Palestinian prisoners have no right to social distancing

Summary of [original article](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-israel-supreme-court-palestinians-prisoners-no-rights-social-distancing):

> Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that Palestinian prisoners have no right to social distancing protection against coronavirus. Adalah attorney Myssana Morany, in a statement released following the ruling, slammed the court for accepting "The fiction pitched to it by Israeli authorities that Covid-19 social distancing policies - essential for everyone else - are not relevant to the Palestinian 'security prisoners' it holds behind bars". "Israeli authorities claimed today in court that social distancing policies essential for protecting prisoners serving time for criminal charges are somehow not relevant for 'security prisoners'. The Israel Prison Service should have stood together with us today and demanded that it be granted the means to protect the people for whose health and safety it holds direct responsibility," Morany said.

Protesters in Khabarovsk see the charges against Furgal as unsubstantiated and demand that he stand trial at home. "We want to protect Furgal," said Evgenia Selina, who joined Saturday's protest.

## Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1957399/vietnam-sees-first-covid-case-in-100-days):

> HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease. "Patient 416" is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16. Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.

`/u/gabonthegreat` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxmqa7/vietnam_has_detected_its_first_locally/):

> So did it come from outside the country or was the virus circulating amongst non-tested people for 100 days and was finally detected after a test?

## Canada’s top doctor warns young people to not give in to coronavirus fatigue

Summary of [original article](https://www.24story.net/2020/07/canadas-top-doctor-warns-young-people.html):

> Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam is doubling down on warnings to young Canadians to stop fuelling the spread of the novel coronavirus. Tam delivered that pre-weekend warning - one week after her deputy Dr. Howard Njoo did the same - because of the worrying trend of rising infections among people aged 20 to 39. The 20-to-39 age group accounted for 60 per cent of those cases, and one-third of them had to be hospitalized, said Tam.

`/u/madsmadhatter` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hxk41c/canadas_top_doctor_warns_young_people_to_not_give/):

> The same people blaming the youth are the same people forcing us to go back to work because it’s “safe”. 
> 
> Honestly I live in a college town where all there is for younger people to do is go to bars and go to the river. No one is at the bars. No one is at the river. 
> 
> You know who is out AND without masks? The boomers. All I see in my town are the rich old people at their golf courses, playing rounds and drinking, not socially distancing, and not wearing masks. When I do see young people out, I ALWAYS see them wearing a mask. 
> 
> Obviously the sample size of my small town is not a large data point, but man. It’s frustrating to hear a lot of the blame being shifted to younger people, when the older generations are the ones forcing us back to work, especially when most of us youngins would love nothing more than to stay inside and not spread this shit. ESPECIALLY when the boomers forcing us back out aren’t following socially distancing guidelines.
