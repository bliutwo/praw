## Scientists Say World Is Approaching Non-Reversible “Tipping Point” in Plastic Pollution. In other words, we’re permeating our entire ecosystem.

Summary of [original article](https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientist-world-non-reversible-tipping-point-plsatic-pollution):

> An international team of researchers are ringing the alarm bells, warning that our global plastic pollution problem may be nearing the point of no return. The researchers believe that plastic pollution isn't just an environmental issue, but a political and economic one as well - the root of the problem that needs to be addressed first. "Reducing emissions requires drastic actions, like capping the production of virgin plastic to increase the value of recycled plastic, and banning export of plastic waste unless it is to a country with better recycling," Tekman argued.

## Indigenous peoples patrolling the Peruvian Amazon equipped with smartphones and satellite data were able to drastically reduce illegal deforestation, according to the results of an experiment published Monday

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210712-satellite-data-helped-indigenous-peruvians-save-rainforest-study):

> Indigenous peoples patrolling the Peruvian Amazon equipped with smartphones and satellite data were able to drastically reduce illegal deforestation, according to the results of an experiment published Monday. The new study was led by Researchers from New York University and Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with Rainforest Foundation US and the Indigenous People's Organization of the Eastern Amazon. "The whole point is to put the deforestation information into the hands of those most affected by its consequences and who can take action to stop it," said Tom Bewick, Peru country director for RFUS. Over the course of the two-year study, the communities that carried out patrols using satellite data prevented the destruction of an estimated 456 hectares of rainforest, avoiding the release of more than 234,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

## China bans pro-democracy candidates in Macau elections: Move mirrors crackdown in Hong Kong and comes despite pledges the territory would have high levels of autonomy

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/china-bans-pro-democracy-candidates-in-macau-elections):

> On Friday the head of the electoral commission, Tong Hio Fong, announced that 21 candidates - including all 15 listed under the banners of three pro-democracy groups - had been disqualified from running in Macau's 12 September elections. Under its national security law, in place since 2009, Macau requires popular election candidates to formally declare support for the Macau Basic Law and their loyalty to the jurisdiction. A deadline to replace those expelled with replacement candidates passed on Sunday, but Chiang said they expected any new candidates would also be disqualified.

> If you can ban candidates, it is not a real election. Let's call it what it is ... appointments from the CCP.
