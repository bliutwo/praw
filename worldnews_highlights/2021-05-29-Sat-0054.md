## Israel now holding 13 Palestinian journalists, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemns Israel’s misuse of administrative detention to hound Palestinian reporters

Summary of [original article](https://rsf.org/en/news/israel-now-holding-13-palestinian-journalists):

> A week ago, on 21 May, an Israeli judge ordered an 11-day extension to the administrative detention of another Palestinian journalist, Alghad TV cameraman Hazem Nasser, who was arrested at an Israeli checkpoint at the entrance to the West Bank town of Tlkarm on 12 May as he was returning from Nablus, 40 km to the south, where he had been filming clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian residents. Ahmad Azaizeh, a blogger who freelances for various outlets including Bokra.net, a local news site, was arrested at his home in Nazareth, in northern Israel, on 12 May after covering clashes between Palestinian citizens and Israeli security forces in Jerusalem, and was placed in administrative detention for "Inciting hatred." A subsequent order was issued extending his detention until 17 May, but he was not released when that order expired. According to RSF's tally, the Israeli authorities are currently holding a total of at least 13 Palestinian journalists.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/26/another-candidate-assassinated-in-mexico-ahead-of-june-6-vote):

> A mayoral candidate has been killed in Mexico, bringing to 34 the total number of candidates murdered nationwide ahead of June 6 legislative elections that will fill thousands of local seats and nearly half of the country's governors. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the gangs were killing candidates to scare voters away from the polls Experts say drug gangs want to place sympathetic candidates in town halls and city governments, so they can operate without interference from police and extort money from local businesses and government budgets. "Organised crime is fully engaged in this election," Payan said, "They are killing and kidnapping candidates and extorting money from candidates, even asking certain candidates to step down because they understand who can be their ally and who can be controlled once they get into local government."

## Photo of massive tree being hauled down Vancouver Island highway sparks global outrage

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tree-cedar-truck-viral-social-media-1.6042822):

> In an emailed response to CBC News, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Forests said the tree was cut between March and mid-August of last year and then transported by Western Forest Products "a month before the Special Tree Protection Regulation came into effect on Sept. 11, of 2020.". "Government brought in this regulation to protect exceptionally large trees of all species throughout the province, and today, a tree of this size might well be illegal to harvest under the regulation, and fines of up to $100,000 could be imposed if it was," the email says. "Especially right now with people fighting to make sure we don't log off these old-growth trees. Holy cow, this is a tree like the ones they are fighting for and it's driving down the road right now," said Beecroft.
