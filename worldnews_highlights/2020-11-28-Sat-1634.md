## French police fired tear gas at protesters rallying in Paris against a bill that would make it a criminal offence to film or take photos of police with malevolent intent

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55115659):

> French police fired tear gas at protesters rallying in Paris against a bill that would make it a criminal offence to film or take photos of police with malevolent intent. Opponents say the bill undermines press freedom to document police brutality. The government argues that the bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses - and is only aimed at giving protection to police officers.

> "Malevolent intent" is interesting wording. I think there's a very strong argument that filming police brutality, corruption or other deriliction of duty is done with benevolent intent.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/27/one-year-old-boy-shot-dead-during-alleged-kidnapping-in-canada):

> A one-year-old infant in Canada has been fatally shot in an incident involving police officers who opened fire on a pickup truck while responding to an alleged kidnapping. Investigators have not yet confirmed if police gunfire killed the boy. Police soon located the father's vehicle along a rural country road. After police attempted to stop him, the truck collided with a police car and another vehicle.

> The mistake here was firing into a vehicle the police suspected had a hostage in it. 
> 
> That is the epic level fuck up.
> 
> Killing the child was the result of this epic level fuck up.
> 
> If they hadn't known about the child this would have merely been an unfortunate accident. The police have no excuse here. In this case, they were stopping the vehicle *because they knew it contained a hostage*. Knowing the guy driving it had a hostage, they decided not to follow protocol and back off in order to negotiate. Instead, **they decided it was worth risking the child's life to kill the driver, rather than not risk the child's life and and de-escalate the situation.**
> 
> This is piss poor... no not piss poor. This was a choice to deliberately endanger an innocent person, namely the dead child, all in the name of ignoring best practices, their training, and the hostage's life.
> 
> There is literally no excuse for them to have opened fire on the car.
> 
> None.

> edit: spelling

> edit 2: What else could they have possibly done?" or "He tried to run over a cop, what else could they have done?" Has already been answered, by me and several dozens of people. If you can't think of anything besides "Fucking shoot into a car that has a hostage in it and pray you don't hit it!" then you really should take the time consider any of the myriad other possibilities, many of which have been presented in this thread.
> 
> If you think the only two options are fire wildly into a car with a hostage in it or "do nothing", or some other version of "let them go" you're not too smart and need to learn to count past two (2).
> 
> I'll reiterate. There were hundreds of options that didn't involve placing that child in the path of incoming fire.
> 
> edit 3: Shutting down inbox replies. Too may idiots trying to justify killing a baby. I don't need that shit in my life. Also, getting out ahead of this before any more show up; please don't give me any more awards. If you have to, donate your hard earned money during this pandemic to those that need it. Any charity will do. From food banks to charities for children whose parents have been killed by senseless violence, make your money do something besides fill Reddit's bank accounts.

> This is the the kind of language that inflames anger and disgust between political tribes and, not coincidentally, grabs eyes and sells ads.
