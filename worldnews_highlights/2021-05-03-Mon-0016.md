> They are sort of far right movements supporters following the local tradition of being stupid before fascists.

## Speed at which world’s glaciers are melting has doubled in 20 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/28/speed-at-which-worlds-glaciers-are-melting-has-doubled-in-20-years):

> The melting of the world's glaciers has nearly doubled in speed over the past 20 years and contributes more to sea-level rise than either the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, according to the most comprehensive global study of ice rivers ever undertaken. The study uses historical Nasa satellite data and new statistical methods to construct three-dimensional topographies going back 20 years and covering 99.9% of the world's glaciers. "A doubling of the thinning rates in 20 years for glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica tells us we need to change the way we live. We need to act now," he said.

`/u/Naggion` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n3gksb/speed_at_which_worlds_glaciers_are_melting_has/):

> We really, really, need to take this seriously otherwise we are going to be in a whole lot of trouble. Politicians (and the general public) need to act and act now. Time is running out. For the sake of future generations, please heed the warnings that are all around us.

## Labelled a terror group by Ottawa, ProudBoys Canada dissolves itself

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/proud-boys-canada-dissolves-1.6011282):

> Proud Boys Canada, a far-right group that Ottawa named as a terrorist entity earlier this year, has dissolved itself, saying it has done nothing wrong, according to a statement by the organization on Sunday. "The truth is, we were never terrorists or a white supremacy group," the statement posted by the administrator of the official Proud Boys channel on Telegram said. Founded in 2016, the Proud Boys began as an organization protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity in the United States and Canada, and grew into a group that embraced street fighting.

`/u/peachyshieldmaiden` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n3npuj/labelled_a_terror_group_by_ottawa_proudboys/):

> One guy claims they aren’t terrorist because, "We are electricians, carpenters, financial advisors, mechanics, etc. More than that, we are fathers, brothers, uncles and sons.”
> 
> Wow. I didn’t know that being an electrician and someone’s son made you automatically not a terrorist. Fathers can’t be terrorists either. Clearly the world was wrong about Bin Laden since he had a kids.

## India’s prime minister Modi has suffered a rare political defeat in a key state election in West Bengal, amid signs of a voter backlash over his handling of the coronavirus disaster

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/02/narendra-modi-loses-key-state-election-west-bengal-covid-grips-india):

> India's prime minister has suffered a rare political defeat in a key state election, amid signs of a voter backlash over his handling of the coronavirus disaster as the country recorded a record number of deaths. Narendra Modi had been expected to make significant gains on Sunday in West Bengal, one of few states where his rightwing Bharatiya Janata party does not have a parliamentary majority. Vinay Sitapati, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka university, said: "Had the BJP won Bengal, it would have been spun as validation of their nationwide Covid approach. We should not make the opposite mistake: the Bengal loss is because of a combination of longstanding local factors." He predicted regional leaders and an "Eventual patchwork of parties" - rather than a weakened Congress party - would now take on Modi nationally.

`/u/aham_brahmasmi` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n36m01/indias_prime_minister_modi_has_suffered_a_rare/):

> What would be rare is if Modi won in West Bengal.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reportr.world/news/philippines-tells-china-to-get-the-f-ck-out-of-a4736-20210503):

> The Philippines' top diplomat on Monday told China to "Get the f*ck out" of its waters as Manila fired a fresh diplomatic protest over Beijing's moves in the Scarborough Shaol. Teodoro Locsin Jr. questioned what China is doing with its "Friendship" with the Philippines as it refuses to heed Manila's call to pull out its ships from the West Philippine Sea. China said the group of its aircraft carrier, Shandong, was recently in the South China Sea for drills aimed at asserting "Sovereignty" as a standoff with the Philippines dragged.
