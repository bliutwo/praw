## City of London to remove statues linked to slavery trade

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-finance-diversity/city-of-london-to-remove-statues-linked-to-slavery-trade-idUSKBN29Q1IX?rpc=401&):

> 3 Min Read.LONDON - The City of London on Thursday approved the removal from its ceremonial Guildhall home of statues of two figures that symbolise the financial sector's historic role in slavery. The move, voted through by the City's elected representatives, is part of a wider debate over how Britain remembers and represents its history, sparked by the spontaneous toppling of a slave trader's statue in the city of Bristol during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.Following those protests, the corporation that runs the Square Mile financial district set up a task force on tackling racism, which recommended removing statues of William Beckford and John Cass from the medieval Guildhall. "The view of members was that removing and re-siting statues linked to slavery is an important milestone in our journey towards a more inclusive and diverse City," the City's political leader Catherine McGuinness said.

> As a German, I have to say I am glad that we removed Nazi statues. We still remember the history without displaying Nazi memorials.
> 
> I don't think there is an inherent need to display such things outside of museums.

> Scientists have unearthed massive, 98-million-year-old fossils in southwest Argentina they say may have belonged to the largest dinosaur ever discovered. Human-sized pieces of fossilized bone belonging to the giant sauropod appear to be 10-20 percent larger than those attributed to Patagotitan mayorum, the biggest dinosaur ever identified, according to a statement Wednesday from the National University of La Matanza's CTYS scientific agency. Alejandro Otero of Argentina's Museo de La Plata is working on piecing together a likeness of the new dinosaur from two-dozen vertebrae and bits of pelvic bone uncovered so far.

> "Biggest dinosaur ever identified" is a topic of...continued and intense debate. Sauropods tend to leave pretty fragmentary fossils, and reconstructing a whole animal from loose bits is tricky. *Maraapunisaurus* (*Amphicoelias*) is a particularly notorious one as the original specimens for it are lost (probably disintegrated, they were found before preserving fossils was invented) and estimates range from 200ft and 170 tons to ~100 feet and 70 tons. 
> 
> That being said...bone fragments the size of humans combined with finding it in Argentina does suggest this is gonna be a *big* motherfucker, world's largest or not. The list for probable longest and heaviest sauropodomorphs (bigass long-necked fuckers) is basically an assortment from the western US, Argentina and one or two from China.

## Korean scientists developed a technique for diagnosing prostate cancer from urine within only 20 minutes with almost 100% accuracy, using AI and a biosensor, without the need for an invasive biopsy. It may be further utilized in the precise diagnoses of other cancers using a urine test.

Summary of [original article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/nrco-ccb011821.php):

> An approach utilizing a single cancer factor associated with a cancer diagnosis was limited in increasing the diagnosis accuracy to over 90%. However, to overcome this limitation, the team simultaneously utilized different kinds of cancer factors instead of using only one to enhance the diagnostic accuracy innovatively. The team developed an ultrasensitive semiconductor sensor system capable of simultaneously measuring trace amounts of selected four cancer factors in urine for diagnosing prostate cancer. "This research developed a smart biosensor that can rapidly diagnose prostate cancer with almost 100 percent accuracy only through a urine test, and it can be further utilized in the precise diagnoses of other cancers using a urine test," Dr. Lee at the KIST said.
