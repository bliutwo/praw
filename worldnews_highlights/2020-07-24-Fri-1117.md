> The Journal spoke with dozens of startup founders, investors, and advisers, who said Amazon met with or invested in their companies, only to later build its own products that directly competed with the smaller company. Amazon told Business Insider that it does not use confidential information that companies share when Amazon invests to create competing products. The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into "Hundreds" of acquisitions by Amazon and other tech firms to determine whether they gained any unfair advantages by purchasing "Nascent competitors." The FTC has also spoken with sellers on Amazon's platform after a Journal investigation from April found that Amazon used data from third-party vendors to launch competing products.

> Isn't that a huge reason for their success? I feel like it's nothing new and they've been getting businesses to their monopoly platform, just to see them grow and in the end undermine them.

## A doctor has run 22 miles to work and back wearing a mask to help stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around face coverings and to raise funds for charity. He recorded that oxygen levels never fell below 98% of what it would usually be.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/masks-covid-19-doctor-oxygen-1520060):

> A doctor has run 22 miles to work and back wearing a mask to help stop the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories around face coverings and to raise funds for charity. Tom Lawton, who works at the Bradford Royal Infirmary in Yorkshire, north England, said he decided to run with the mask on, following his concerns for people with respiratory illnesses who want to wear a mask but are too scared to do so over false information. "To make up for the fact that I'm fit and healthy, I thought if I'm running then I'm using 10 times the amount of oxygen as I would if I'm just sat here. If I can show that I can get 10 peoples worth of oxygen through the mask then hopefully someone who has a respiratory disease and wants to wear a mask, they can be reassured that it is safe thing to do."

`/u/peter-doubt` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hwyruv/a_doctor_has_run_22_miles_to_work_and_back/):

> Anyone using that excuse should be told to bring oxygen *and* a mask.  Their lungs would be chronically ill, already.

## Narcissists and psychopaths are more likely to refuse to wear masks, Says New Research

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/narcissists-psychopaths-face-mask-requirement-mandate-social-distancing-covid-19-coronavirus-1519732):

> Respondents demonstrating Dark Triad traits-so-called because their malevolent qualities correlate with more crime, less compassion and dangerous leadership qualities-were more likely to hoard and less likely to take preventive measures. The results correspond well with previous research into individuals with Dark Triad personality traits, who tend to be more impulsive, short-sighted, competitive and risk-taking. While psychopaths and narcissists may be less likely to comply with coronavirus restrictions, the evidence doesn't suggest that personality disorders are to blame for social-distancing failures and mask-mandate pushback.

`/u/cabeck13` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hx15qb/narcissists_and_psychopaths_are_more_likely_to/):

> Funny, I wear a mask specifically to get off on the idea that I'm just a *better* person than non-maskers.

> US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has called on "Free nations" to triumph over the threat of what he said was a "New tyranny" from China. "If the free world doesn't change Communist China, Communist China will change us," he said at the Richard Nixon presidential library in Yorba Linda, California. Pompeo said Washington had ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, this week because it had become a centre for espionage and operations to illegally obtain US companies' trade secrets.

> 
> Here's something possibly controversial: Fuck Xi, Fuck Putin, Fuck Trump. Fuck all three of them. Authoritarians have much in common.
