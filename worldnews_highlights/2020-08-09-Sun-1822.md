## Exit poll declares improbable 79.7% victory for ‘dictator’ Lukashenko — as Belarus prepares for mass protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belarus-election-lukashenko-result-exit-polls-latest-a9662156.html):

> Serious clashes have broken out between police and protesters in Belarus following disputed exit polls that claimed to show a 79.7 per cent victory for long-time president Alexander Lukashenko in Sunday's elections. The unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 6.8 per cent assigned to her by the official poll, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. Earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko.

## 'We failed': one scientist's despair as Brazil Covid-19 deaths hit 100,000

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/brazil-covid-19-deaths-natalia-pasternak-bolsonaro):

> "Reopening is a recipe for disaster," the 43-year-old scientist warned on a recent talkshow, as lockdown efforts withered despite the soaring number of infections and deaths. Brazil has recorded more than 3m infections - second only to the US. "We failed - as a country, as a government, as a society - to get the message out in a clear, transparent and educative way," she admitted. As Brazil passed its latest cruel milestone, Pasternak said she was disheartened to think things could have been different.

`/u/SpongeJake` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i6htyb/we_failed_one_scientists_despair_as_brazil/):

> “Since March she has sounded the alarm – and petitioned the government – by penning more than 50 articles, appearing on 19 podcasts and giving nearly 300 interviews.”
> 
> Yes, she has nothing to apologize for.  Her government let Brazil down, not the scientists.

Chad's Justice Minister Djimet Arabi told AFP he had taken note of the Commission's report and that an inquiry had been launched to determine who was responsible for the deaths.
