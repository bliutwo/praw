## Huawei reportedly worked with 4 additional companies to build surveillance tools that track people by ethnicity, following recent revelations that it tested a 'Uighur alarm'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-built-more-surveillance-tools-to-track-uyghurs-report-2020-12):

> A new investigation published by The Post on Saturday found that Huawei has worked with dozens of security firms to build surveillance tools - and that products it developed in partnership with four of those companies claimed to be able to identify and monitor people based on their ethnicity. Huawei worked with Beijing Xintiandi Information Technology, DeepGlint, Bresee, and Maiyuesoft on products that made a variety of claims about estimating, tracking, and visualizing people's ethnicities, as well as other Chinese tech companies on tools to suppress citizens' complaints about wrongdoing by local government officials and analyze "Voiceprint" data, according to The Post. In the US, law enforcement agencies and even schools have also increased their reliance on facial recognition software and other AI-powered surveillance technologies, despite growing evidence that such tools exhibit racial and gender bias.
