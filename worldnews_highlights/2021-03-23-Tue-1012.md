> >A senior Saudi official issued what was perceived to be a death threat against the independent United Nations investigator, Agnès Callamard, after her investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
> 
> >In an interview with the Guardian, the outgoing special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings said that a UN colleague alerted her in January 2020 that a senior Saudi official had twice threatened in a meeting with other senior UN officials in Geneva that month to have Callamard “taken care of” if she was not reined in by the UN.
> 
> >Asked how the comment was perceived by her Geneva-based colleagues, Callamard said: “A death threat. That was how it was understood.”
> 
> >Callamard, a French national and human rights expert who will this month take on her new post as secretary general of Amnesty International, was the first official to publicly investigate and publish a detailed report into the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a prominent former insider who used his column at the Washington Post to write critically about the Saudi government.
> 
> >Callamard’s 100-page report, published in June 2019, concluded that there was “credible evidence” that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior Saudi officials were liable for the killing, and called the murder an “international crime”. The Biden administration has since released its own unclassified report, which concluded that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder. The Saudi government has denied the killing, which occurred in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, was ordered by the future king.
> 
> >The Guardian independently corroborated Callamard’s account of the January 2020 episode.
> 
> >The alleged threats were made, she said, at a “high-level” meeting between Geneva-based Saudi diplomats, visiting Saudi officials and UN officials in Geneva. During the exchange, Callamard was told, they criticised her work on the Khashoggi murder, registering their anger about her investigation and her conclusions. The Saudi officials also raised baseless allegations that she had received money from Qatar – a frequent refrain against critics of the Saudi government.
> 
> >Callamard said one of the visiting senior Saudi officials is then alleged to have said that he had received phone calls from individuals who were prepared to “take care of her”.

## Cern experiment hints at new force of nature - Experts reveal ‘cautious excitement’ over unstable particles that fail to decay as standard model suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/mar/23/large-hadron-collider-scientists-particle-physics):

> The mathematical framework that underpins scientists' understanding of the subatomic world, known as the standard model of particle physics, firmly maintains that the particles should break down into products that include electrons at exactly the same rate as they do into products that include a heavier cousin of the electron, a particle called a muon. The standard model of particle physics describes the particles and forces that govern the subatomic world. If the result turns out to be true, it could be explained by so-far hypothetical particles called Z primes or leptoquarks that bring new forces to bear on other particles.

> "Very rarely do bills originate in the Upper House. I think in the last 12 years there's been 10 or 11 bills and only four of those have ever passed this bill is huge, this is a big bill about a big issue and it originated in the Upper House." After passing the Legislative Council unanimously, MPs in the Lower House voted 16 to 6 in favour of the bill. Because a raft of amendments were made, the bill returned to the Upper House for a final sign off.

## Norway blocks Rolls-Royce's plan to sell engine maker to Russia

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rolls-royce-hldg-norway-russia/norway-blocks-rolls-royces-plan-to-sell-engine-maker-to-russia-idUSKBN2BF11U?il=0):

> 3 Min Read.OSLO - Norway will block Rolls-Royce from selling a Norwegian maritime engine maker to a Russian company on national security grounds, its justice minister told parliament on Tuesday. Relations between Norway and Russia, which share a border in the Arctic, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.That triggered more tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides and more frequent military manoeuvres. While corporate takeovers have been assessed from time to time, Norway had abstained from blocking any business transactions since the law came in, the government's NSM security agency said this month.

> Just sell it to the UK, then sell it to Russia. They'll just wave it through like with ARM.
