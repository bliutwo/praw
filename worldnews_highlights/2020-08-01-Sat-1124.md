Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/07/28/brazilian-health-workers-file-icc-complaint-arguing-bolsonaro-covid-19-response-has):

> A network of unions and social organizations representing over a million health workers in Brazil filed a complaint Monday calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate President Jair Bolsonaro's widely condemned handling of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing it amounts to a crime against humanity. Brazilian organizations have submitted a complaint to the International Criminal Court against the Bolsonaro administration's handling of the #COVID19 pandemic, describing the "Contempt, neglect and denial" as a crime against humanity. NPR contacted the president's media office Monday for a comment about the complaint and was referred to the attorney general's department, which said that it would respond only after hearing from the ICC. "The Bolsonaro administration should be held accountable for its callous response to the pandemic and for refusing to protect the care workers and Brazilians that it has sworn to defend," Marcio Monzane, regional secretary of UNI Americas, the group that led the legal action, said in a statement.

## Face up to it - you will probably all get coronavirus, Jair Bolsonaro tells Brazilians

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/01/face-will-probably-get-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-tells-brazilians/):

> Mr Bolsonaro, who has compared the virus to a "Little flu", has fought stay-at-home measures to contain it and regularly flouted social distancing guidelines, hitting the streets of Brasilia to exchange handshakes and hugs with supporters. On the same day, the president's office announced his wife had tested positive for the virus. Mr Bolsonaro argues that stay-at-home measures are needlessly hurting the economy.

`/u/filipinotruther` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i1ovb1/face_up_to_it_you_will_probably_all_get/):

> >President Jair Bolsonaro has said nearly everyone will probably end up catching the new coronavirus, urging Brazilians to "face up to it" and saying there was nothing to fear.
> The far-right leader's latest bid to downplay the pandemic came as Brazil closed in on the grim milestone of 100,000 people killed by the virus, the second-highest death toll in the world, after the United States.
> Mr Bolsonaro, who has spent three weeks in quarantine after being infected with the virus, pointed to his own case as an example.
> "I'm in the high-risk group," the 65-year-old president told journalists during a visit to the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.
> "I knew I was going to catch it someday, as I think unfortunately nearly everyone here is going to catch it eventually. What are you afraid of? Face up to it," he said.
> "I regret the deaths. But people die every day, from lots of things. That's life."

## In Iran, Chinese trawlers are damaging marine ecosystems and the livelihood of local fishermen

Summary of [original article](https://observers.france24.com/en/20200729-iran-chinese-trawlers-destroy-marine-ecosystems):

> Local fishing authorities have refuted these accusations for years, going so far as to deny that there are any Chinese trawlers operating in these waters and stating that there is no fishing agreement between Iran and these Chinese companies. Some local officials or former members of local fisheries have even created shell companies- these are Chinese boats with Chinese fishermen aboard but they have changed the names of the trawlers to something Iranian and they fly the Iranian flag. Several Iranian media outlets have reported that local officials, many of them former or current members of the organization of fisheries of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, agreed to collaborate with Chinese fishing operations via shell companies in exchange for a 6% profit from the yield of the Chinese trawlers.
