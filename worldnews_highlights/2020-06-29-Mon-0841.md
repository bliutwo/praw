Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said on Monday that Trump, along with more than 30 others Iran accuses of involvement in the January 3 attack that killed General Qassem Soleimani, face "Murder and terrorism charges", the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. Alqasimehr did not identify anyone else sought other than Trump, but stressed Iran would continue to pursue his prosecution even after his presidency ends. Alqasimehr was also quoted as saying Iran had requested a "Red notice" be put out for Trump and the others, the highest-level notice issued by Interpol, requesting that seeks the location and arrest of the individual named.

## China forces birth control on Muslims to suppress population

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP):

> The Chinese government is taking draconian measures to slash birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities as part of a sweeping campaign to curb its Muslim population, even as it encourages some of the country's Han majority to have more children. "God bequeaths children on you. To prevent people from having children is wrong," said Omirzakh, who tears up even now thinking back to that day. In Shihezi, a Han-dominated city where Uighurs make up just 2% of the population, the government subsidizes baby formula and hospital birth services to encourage more children, state media reported.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/28/21306256/amazon-warehouse-germany-strike-safety-coronavirus):

> Amazon workers at six sites across Germany plan to strike Monday because dozens of staff members at its logistics centers have been infected with the coronavirus, union officials told Reuters. Amazon warehouse workers in Germany have struck several times in recent years, over worker pay and conditions. In recent months, Amazon warehouse workers in the US have staged protests over what they say are unsafe working conditions, and walked off the job in several cities.

> We can do our part by not buying Amazon products for the duration of the strike. Good luck tackling this behemoth, Germany.

## Ukraine has declassified previously secret Soviet documents on the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant on 26 April 1986, making them public on Monday.

Summary of [original article](https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/119019/ukraine-declassifies-chernobyl-documents/):

> Ukraine has declassified previously secret Soviet documents on the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant on 26 April 1986, making them public on Monday. After Reactor 4 of the Soviet nuclear plant at Chernobyl exploded, a no-go zone was set up around the area due to the risk of radiation. In early April, a forest fire fed by gusty winds and unusually dry weather had broken out around the abandoned nuclear plant.

`/u/ppitm` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hhn0rw/ukraine_has_declassified_previously_secret_soviet/):

> I've skimmed 700-800 pages of it so far, and haven't seen anything too terribly interesting. All the good stuff is in Moscow, and the Ukrainian KGB just made references to collecting those materials.
> 
> Most of the 1800 pages are the same format of report filed on different days: 
> 
> * Weather, radiation levels and decontamination efforts in Kiev
> * Activities of foreigners in Ukraine
> * Conditions at the ChNPP and evolving theories as to the cause of the accident, etc
> 
> It is an intriguing window into the world of the relatively toothless late-Soviet KGB, with their army of informants and agents who mostly just gave people a gentle reminder when they were running their mouth too much.

## NATO officials say they were briefed on Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan — even though Trump claims he wasn't

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-bounty-us-soldiers-afghanistan-nato-officials-briefed-trump-denies-2020-6):

> Three NATO officials say they had been briefed on intelligence that Russian operatives were secretly offering cash bounties to Taliban-linked militants for US casualties in Afghanistan - as President Donald Trump claimed he was not, and dismissed news reports on the intelligence as a "Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax.". The revelation that US intelligence had briefed the White House on the Taliban bounties had been a closely-held secret for several months, until US officials began briefing UK and other European allies last week. Three NATO military officials told Insider on Monday they had been briefed by US intelligence of the potential threat, with two of them saying they were given the briefing about one week ago.

`/u/teslacoil1` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hi08gv/nato_officials_say_they_were_briefed_on_russian/):

> I was watching Morning Joe today and a retired US General (General Barry R McCaffrey) was invited on the show.  The retired General more or less said that the chance that Trump wasn't briefed on the Russia bounties was probably zero. The retired General insinuated that Trump had to have been briefed on it, especially if the allies of the US were briefed on it.
> 
> Assuming Trump was briefed on it, then his decision to try to invite Putin/Russia back to the G7 is nothing short of treason.   Trump is truly a puppet of Putin.

## Russian bounties to Taliban-linked militants resulted in deaths of U.S. troops, according to intelligence assessments

> Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. In each of those years, several service members were also killed by what are known as "Green on blue" hostile incidents by members of Afghan security forces, which are sometimes believed to have been infiltrated by the Taliban. Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-highest-ranking member of the House GOP leadership, also took to Twitter on Sunday to say that if the report of Russian bounties "Is true, the White House must explain" why the president wasn't briefed, who did know and when, and "What has been done in response to protect our forces & hold Putin responsible."

> Everybody forgot to tell Trump? "The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said."

## Europeans’ trust in Trump’s America ‘is gone’ after coronavirus pandemic, poll finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/europeans-trust-in-trumps-america-is-gone-after-pandemic-poll.html):

> The poll of 11,000 respondents across nine European countries, commissioned by the European Council on Foreign Relations, showed that in almost every country surveyed, there was an increasingly negative perception of the U.S. In Denmark, Portugal, France, Germany and Spain, around two-thirds of people surveyed said that their view of the U.S. had worsened during the health crisis, the ECFR think-tank, which provides research on European foreign and security policy, said Monday. "In a frightening world, one looks around for friends. But Europeans are uncertain who they can rely on. As a pan-European poll ECFR carried out in 2019 showed, Europeans preferred the idea of an EU that was strong enough not to be forced to choose sides in a conflict but, ultimately, would usually side with the United States over any other ally. Now, Europeans' trust in Trump's America is gone." "The Covid-19 crisis has caught the European public up with the reality that European foreign policymakers have suspected to be the case for a while. Europeans are, ultimately, alone and vulnerable," report author Susi Dennison said.
