## The US “War on Terror” Has Created at Least 37 Million Refugees

Summary of [original article](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/09/war-on-terror-displacement-refugees-us-imperialism):

> Last week, Brown University's Costs of War Project released a report that revealed a startling statistic: since George W. Bush's initiation of the "Global War on Terror," "At least 37 million people have fled their homes the eight most violent wars the U.S. military has launched or participated in." The interventions in Afghanistan have resulted in 5.3 million displaced people; Pakistan, 3.7 million; Iraq, 9.2 million; Libya, 1.2 million; Syria, 7.1 million; Yemen, 4.4 million; Somalia, 4.2 million; and the Philippines, 1.7 million. The 37 million figure is a conservative estimate - the total number might be as high as 59 million, if not higher, since no estimation has accounted for the number of Africans driven from their homes due to US military interventions on the continent.

## H&M cuts ties with Chinese supplier over accusations of 'forced labour'

Summary of [original article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/h-m-cuts-ties-with-chinese-supplier-over-accusations-of-forced-13115222):

> STOCKHOLM: Swedish clothing giant H&M said Tuesday it was ending its relationship with a Chinese yarn producer over accusations of "Forced labour" involving ethnic and religious minorities from China's Xinjiang province. "While there are no indications for forced labour in the Shangyu mill, we have decided to, until we get more clarity around allegations of forced labour, phase out our indirect business relationship with Huafu Fashion Co, regardless of unit and province, within the next 12 months." On Monday US customs said it would bar a raft of Chinese products including cotton, garments and hair products, from Xinjiang over fears they were made using forced labour.

## Archeologists find remains of syphilis-infected Europeans that pre-date Columbus, challenging the theory that he introduced the disease to Europe

Summary of [original article](https://phys.org/news/2020-09-columbus-syphilis-europe.html):

> Explorer Christopher Columbus, long blamed for bringing syphilis to Europe from the New World, may have gotten a bad rap, new research suggests. The newly discovered diversity among the family of bacteria that causes syphilis may indicate that the disease originated or developed in Europe, potentially dispelling the long-held theory that Columbus and his sailors triggered the outbreak after one of four voyages between 1492 and 1502, researchers said. Citation: Did Columbus really introduce syphilis to Europe? retrieved 15 September 2020 from https://phys.org/news/2020-09-columbus-syphilis-europe.

`/u/basaltgranite` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/itmy9g/archeologists_find_remains_of_syphilisinfected/):

> The bacteria that causes syphilis, *Treponema pallidum*, has a long history in the Old World, where it causes a disease called "Yaws." Uncontroversial. On genetic evidence, the strain that causes syphilis is pretty clearly New World.

## Nearly two-thirds of US young adults unaware 6m Jews killed in the Holocaust | World news

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/16/holocaust-us-adults-study):

> Almost two-thirds of young American adults do not know that 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust, and more than one in 10 believe Jews caused the Holocaust, a new survey has found, revealing shocking levels of ignorance about the greatest crime of the 20th century. The survey, the first to drill down to state level in the US, ranks states according to a score based on three criteria: whether young people have definitely heard about the Holocaust; whether they can name one concentration camp, death camp or ghetto; and whether they know 6 million Jews were killed. The top-scoring state was Wisconsin, where 42% of millennial and Gen Z adults met all three criteria, followed by Minnesota at 37% and Massachusetts at 35%. The lowest-scoring states were Florida at 20%, Mississippi at 18% and Arkansas at 17%. Nationally, 63% of respondents did not know 6 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, and more than one in three thought 2 million or fewer had been killed.

`/u/Jookington_` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/itsymp/nearly_twothirds_of_us_young_adults_unaware_6m/):

> How? That was drilled into us in every social studies and history class I've ever taken. We even had a Holocaust survivor come in and speak with us when I was in elementary school, which I know is not as feasible these days, but come on.
> 
> *I am now aware of how misleading this title is, it's not that they don't know of the Holocaust, but the fact that they didn't know the specific number of Jewish people killed, among other shitty polling tactics. Shit title, shit journalism.
