## Loujain al-Hathloul, who fought Saudi Arabia's ban on women driving, appeared before a judge on Wednesday, shaking uncontrollably, to learn she was being sent to terrorism court, her family said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/25/saudi-activists-trial-transferred-to-terrorism-court-family):

> Saudi Arabia has moved the trial of prominent women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul to a court for terror-related crimes, according to her family. Al-Hathloul, a prominent women's rights activist, was arrested along with about a dozen other female activists in May 2018, just weeks before Saudi Arabia lifted a decades-old ban on female drivers. Some of the activists arrested with al-Hathloul have been provisionally released, while others remain in detention amid what campaigners have called "Opaque" court trials for charges that include contact with foreign media, diplomats and human rights groups.

Summary of [original article](https://thenewsspan.in/covid-19-pandemic-could-be-stopped-if-at-least-70-public-wore-face-masks-consistently-study/):

> The COVID-19 pandemic could be stopped if at least 70 percent of the public wore face masks consistently, according to a research that suggests that the type of material used and the duration of face mask use play major roles in their effectiveness.

Among the many types of face masks in use, such as cloth masks worn for many hours, such as by health care or other essential workers, impact how effective overall mask wearing can be, thermal comfort is an important issue, especially in hot and humid environments, the researchers added.
