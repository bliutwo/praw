## Scientists watch as China's remote glaciers melt at 'shocking' pace

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-china-glacier-widerima-idUSKBN27P34J):

> 5 Min Read.QILIAN MOUNTAINS, China - Glaciers in China's bleak Qilian mountains are disappearing at a shocking rate as global warming brings unpredictable change and raises the prospect of crippling, long-term water shortages, scientists say. Across the mountains, glacier retreat was 50% faster in 1990-2010 than it was from 1956 to 1990, data from the China Academy of Sciences shows. The melting in the mountains could peak within a decade, after which snow melt would sharply decrease due to the smaller, fewer glaciers, China Academy of Sciences expert Shen Yongping said.
