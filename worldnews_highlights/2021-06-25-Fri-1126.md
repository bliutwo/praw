The report warns of a series of thresholds beyond which recovery from climate breakdown may become impossible, The Guardian said. Since the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, the Earth has warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius, according to NASA. The report warns of "Progressively serious, centuries' long and, in some cases, irreversible consequences." The report also said that the millions of people who live along coastlines almost everywhere around the world could be battered by multiple climate calamities at once: drought, heatwaves, cyclones, wildfires and flooding.

## Three Percenters, neo-Nazi group added to Canada's terrorist list

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/terrorist-list-three-percenters-1.6079984):

> The federal government has added the Three Percenters movement to its list of terrorist entities, an anti-government group linked to a recent bomb plot in the U.S. with a known presence in Canada. Canada has added an American neo-Nazi named James Mason, accused of providing ideological and tactical instruction on how to operate a terrorist group to its listed entities and an affiliate of Daesh or the Islamic State in Democratic Republic of the Congo. A group is added to the terrorist list if Canada's security and intelligence agencies, after an "Extremely rigorous" probe, find "Reasonable grounds to believe that an entity has knowingly participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity," the government said in announcing the new designations.

## 2,000 injected with fake Covid-19 vaccines in Mumbai, bogus shots also given in Kolkata

Summary of [original article](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/indian-police-probe-fake-vaccine-scams-in-two-cities):

> MUMBAI - Indian police said on Friday that around 2,000 people were given fake Covid-19 vaccines in Mumbai, and another 500 - some of them disabled - may have suffered the same fate in Kolkata. Inoculation rates rose sharply this week after the government made shots free following a devastating pandemic surge in April and May. Police in Mumbai said around 2,000 people who thought they were being vaccinated were in fact injected with a saline solution. Police said at least 250 disabled and transgender people were injected at one site, and that in total, nearly 500 people may have been given counterfeit jabs across the city.

`/u/T_S_Venture` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/o7lz88/2000_injected_with_fake_covid19_vaccines_in/):

> This is way worse than when they were selling fake vaccine cards.

## Major supplier for Nestle and Pepsi breaks its 'no deforestation' pledge to provide these companies with palm oil from orangutan habitat, report shows

Summary of [original article](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/06/deforestation-of-orangutan-habitat-feeds-global-palm-oil-demand-report-leuser-royal-golden-eagle/):

> RGE's palm oil arm, APICAL, said it had put a monitoring system in place and carried out risk engagement and supplier engagement measures in its supply chain, but RAN said these efforts were not enough as deforestation-tainted palm oil from the Leuser Ecosystem was still ending up in its supply chain. JAKARTA - A major palm oil company supplying to global brands like Nestlé and PepsiCo continues to source the raw commodity from plantations responsible for deforesting prime orangutan habitat in Sumatra, according to a recent investigation. The latter sells its crude palm oil to a palm oil refinery, PT Sari Dumai Sejati, operated by RGE's palm oil arm, APICAL. "The fact is that the PT SDS refinery has been sourcing from PT GSS for over a year and our field team found that sourcing continued at least up to April 2021 despite reports of the mill's non-compliance with no-deforestation policies during this period," Tillack said.
