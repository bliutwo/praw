During their 1996-2001 rule, guided by Islamic law, the Taliban stopped women from working.

> 
> \>In the late 1990s, Saleh was a member of the Northern Alliance (also known as the United Front) and was fighting against the Taliban expansion.
> 
> \>Saleh had a sister, who was tortured to death by Taliban fighters after they started a manhunt for him.
> 
> \>"Sure, and if they kill me, I have told my family and my friends not to complain about anything, because I have killed many of them with pride, so, I am a very, very legitimate target, very legitimate, because when I stand against them, the desire to stand against them is part of my blood. I believe they are wrong."
