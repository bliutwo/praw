## Julian Assange cannot be extradited to US, British judge rules

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/04/julian-assange-cannot-be-extradited-to-us-british-judge-rules?CMP=twt_gu&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium#Echobox=1609758162):

> Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the US to face charges of espionage and of hacking government computers, a British judge has decided. Prosecutors say Assange helped the US defence analyst Chelsea Manning breach the US Espionage Act, was complicit in hacking by others and published classified information that endangered informants. In her ruling, which triggered elation among Assange's supporters that he was not being extradited, but dismay that it was solely based on health grounds, the judge said she had no reason to doubt that "The usual constitutional and procedural protections" would be applied to a trial he might face in the US. Sending Assange across the Atlantic would not breach a bar on extradition for "Political offences" she said, and she had no reason to doubt that "The usual constitutional and procedural protections" would be applied to a trial he might face in the US. She sided with the argument of lawyers for US authorities who had denied Assange was being prosecuted merely for publishing diplomatic cables and military files.

> The extradition request was rejected by the judge because of inadequate conditions regarding mental health and suicide prevention in US maximum security prisons. The decision was not based on the case itself.

## Scotland announces full lockdown, closing schools for all of January

Summary of [original article](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/scotland-announces-full-lockdown-closing-schools-for-all-of-january-1.4449759):

> Scotland will be placed in a full lockdown from midnight on Monday for the duration of January in an effort to stop the coronavirus pandemic spiralling out of control, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The first minister said in an emergency statement to Holyrood that all Scotland's schools would remain closed for the whole of January, shifting to online learning, because of the risks posed by the new Covid variant B117. The new "Stay at home" rules, mirroring the very strict controls imposed last March, would also be legally enforced and greatly restrict who was able to travel, the Scottish government's cabinet agreed earlier on Monday. While Scotland has not experienced the sharp escalation in the number of Covid patients in hospital seen in parts of England over the last week, the number of positive cases has risen to new heights every day, hitting 2,464 on Sunday.

## Vitamin D Deficiency in COVID-19 Quadrupled Death Rate

Summary of [original article](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/942497):

> " highlight the need for randomized controlled trials specifically targeting vitamin D-deficient patients at intake, and make a call for general avoidance of vitamin D deficiency as a safe and inexpensive possible mitigation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic," say De Smet and colleagues in their article, published online November 25 in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology. "What is not clear is whether vitamin D levels are acting as an acute-phase reactant, dropping because of the infection, with larger drops indicating more severe disease, or whether vitamin D deficiency is causing worse outcomes," added Teitelbaum, who is director of the Center for Effective CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Therapies, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Upon admission to hospital, median vitamin D level was 18 ng/mL. A remarkably high percentage of patients with COVID-19 were vitamin D deficientD < 20 ng/mL) when admitted, write the authors.

> >Vitamin D deficiency on admission to hospital was *associated* with a 3.7-fold increase in the odds of dying from COVID-19
> 
> Bear in mind that association isn't the same as causation. There may be other factors involved (such as the reason for Vit-D deficiency) that can affect the results.

> I love how he acts like it's some sort of family emergency and then gives exactly the same reason everybody else is giving for traveling over the holidays. I guess he thinks he's the only person who has a child that lives far away. I bet the warning that his agency sent out didn't say "avoid travel unless your children live far away, in which case it's okay to visit them."
