## World's largest vaccine manufacturer in Maharashtra, India wants to cap vaccine price at $3

Summary of [original article](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/serum-institute-caps-proposed-vaccine-price-at-rs-225/dose/amp_articleshow/77424541.cms):

> Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has set a ceiling price of $3 per dose for the proposed. Through the partnership, the company will accelerate manufacture and delivery of up to 100 million doses as part of the agreement for India and LMICs, as early as the first half of 2021, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute said. The collaboration will provide upfront capital to Serum to increase manufacturing capacity, so that once a vaccine gains regulatory approval and WHO prequalification, doses can be produced at a scale for distribution to India and LMICs.

> So it'll be cheaper to fly to India, spend two weeks in quarantine, get a vaccine and fly back than to get it in the US.

## Amnesty International: widespread human rights violations against protesters, medics, journalists and legal observers who gathered to protest the unlawful killings of Black people in the US

Summary of [original article](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/usa-law-enforcement-violated-black-lives-matter-protesters-human-rights/?=):

> The report, The World is Watching: Mass Violations by US Police of Black Lives Matter Protesters' Rights, builds on Amnesty's interactive mapping of violence against protesters and new findings on the use of lethal force by the police. "The unnecessary and sometimes excessive use of force by police against protesters exhibits the very systemic racism and impunity they had taken to the streets to protest. The research shows that people who were simply exercising their human right to peacefully protest were met with such violence that they lost eyesight, survived brutal beatings, and suffered seizures and severe wounds," said Ernest Coverson, Amnesty International USA's End Gun Violence Campaign Manager. The organization is also calling on all law enforcement agencies to revise their policies and practices for the policing of protests, and comply with international human rights standards, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the guiding principles underpinning all operations before, during and after demonstrations.

## [New Zealand] Covid-19: 100 days of no community spread, no new cases reported

Summary of [original article](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/423108/covid-19-100-days-of-no-community-spread-no-new-cases-reported):

> New Zealand has officially marked 100 days without any community transmission of Covid-19, with no further new cases in managed isolation reported today. "We have seen overseas how quickly the virus can re-emerge and spread in places where it was previously under control, and we need to be prepared to quickly stamp out any future cases in New Zealand." Today is the fourth day in a row that there has been no new cases reported in New Zealand.

`/u/topografica` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i6ami4/new_zealand_covid19_100_days_of_no_community/):

> **Hello non-New Zealanders from r/worldnews. Before you get started tearing into this, some ground rules:**
> 
> * New Zealand isn't "an island". We're a collection of islands. Don't lose sight of basic geography before starting the pointless debates you'd like to wage.
> * Distance has practically nothing to do with COVID-19 spread. We have these things called planes now. They take us to far flung destinations across the Earth very directly. 
> * New Zealand's population is highly densified, and highly urban. Whatever city you'd like to compare New Zealand's cities too, I guarantee ours have more coffee shops per square kilometre.
> * New Zealand's biggest sector of the economy (was) tourism, and saw 3.7 million foreign visitors in 2017 alone. Scaled for population, that's one of the highest tourist:citizen ratios on the planet.
> 
> You are now free to proceed with the pointless back-and-forth Reddit is so well known for.

## India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields):

> The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. While across the world governments have geared towards a "Green recovery" post Covid-19 - the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was "No good reason for any country to include coal" in recovery plans - India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity. India is the world's cheapest producer of solar power and the cost of constructing a new solar plant is 14% less than that of a building a new coal plant.
