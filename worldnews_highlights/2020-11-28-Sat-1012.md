> I'm concerned that Slate magazine has taken Pope Francis' simple and eloquent plea (in his letter to the NYT) for all of us to care for one another, and labels it "Pope **Blasts** Those Who Criticize COVID Restrictions".
>

> McDonald, who receives no salary for being an assistant warden, says she and other PhD students in her position face "Massive amounts of abuse" from undergraduates upset about being told to stick to the rules.

Ruth Smith, who is in the third year of her PhD at Leeds University on the relationship between gender, agriculture and climate change in Tanzania, says: "The pandemic has opened my eyes to how badly PhD students are treated in the UK.
In most European countries PhD researchers are treated as staff.
They are much better paid and are entitled to support like sick pay.
In the UK, we are relied on as staff members but not treated that way."

> What the fuck are these comments, filled with people who don't seem to understand what a PhD is, and seem to think that adults performing the duties of staff in addition to their research are whiny entitled brats for feeling exploited by the lack of compensation for that.
