Summary of [original article](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/serum-institute-caps-proposed-vaccine-price-at-rs-225/dose/amp_articleshow/77424541.cms):

> Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has set a ceiling price of $3 per dose for the proposed. Through the partnership, the company will accelerate manufacture and delivery of up to 100 million doses as part of the agreement for India and LMICs, as early as the first half of 2021, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute said.

> So it'll be cheaper to fly to India, spend two weeks in quarantine, get a vaccine and fly back than to get it in the US.

## France and Germany pulled out of talks to reform the WHO because the US was trying to take control, according to a report

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/france-germany-quit-who-reform-talks-over-us-involvement-reuters-2020-8):

> France and Germany have quit a project to reform the World Health Organization because the US is trying to take control, Reuters reported. The US blueprint is too extreme for France and Germany and the countries' health ministries told Reuters it was wrong that the US was leading the talks. A Trump administration official told Reuters that: "It is regrettable that Germany and France ultimately chose not to join the group in endorsing the roadmap."

## Amnesty International: widespread human rights violations against protesters, medics, journalists and legal observers who gathered to protest the unlawful killings of Black people in the US

Summary of [original article](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/usa-law-enforcement-violated-black-lives-matter-protesters-human-rights/?=):

> The report, The World is Watching: Mass Violations by US Police of Black Lives Matter Protesters' Rights, builds on Amnesty's interactive mapping of violence against protesters and new findings on the use of lethal force by the police. "The unnecessary and sometimes excessive use of force by police against protesters exhibits the very systemic racism and impunity they had taken to the streets to protest. The research shows that people who were simply exercising their human right to peacefully protest were met with such violence that they lost eyesight, survived brutal beatings, and suffered seizures and severe wounds," said Ernest Coverson, Amnesty International USA's End Gun Violence Campaign Manager. The organization is also calling on all law enforcement agencies to revise their policies and practices for the policing of protests, and comply with international human rights standards, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the guiding principles underpinning all operations before, during and after demonstrations.

## "The policeman pinned her head to the pavement". Demonstrations in defence of LGBTQ activist in Poland meet with police crackdown

Summary of [original article](https://oko.press/the-policeman-pinned-her-head-to-the-pavement-demonstrations-in-defence-of-an-lgbtq-activist-in-poland-meet-with-the-police-crackdown/):

> "The policeman pinned her head to the pavement with his boot. She was bleeding, but the police did not react to our pleas to call the ambulance. She was taken to Wilcza street." "We were standing near the police station, but we weren't even shouting. They walked up to us and asked my friend to show his ID. He said, ok, here it is, and reached into his pocket. They reacted as if he was going to pull out a gun. They started jerking him around. Six of them grabbed his legs even though he was screaming don't touch me. They carried him writhing to the police car. There were many others arrested, inside the car. I saw how brutally they were searched." "It is bad" - said Magdalena Biejat, one of the members of the Parliament Left who intervened at the police station "We're sitting on the steps and trying to verify names of the arrested" She told us the phones of the police officials are off the hook, no one is given any information and it is not clear why people are being transported from one police station to another.

## India plans to fell ancient forest to create 40 new coalfields

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-plans-to-fell-ancient-forest-to-create-40-new-coal-fields):

> The coal industry in India is state-owned, but this auction of 40 new coal blocks will see the creation of a privatised, commercial coal sector in India. While across the world governments have geared towards a "Green recovery" post Covid-19 - the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said recently there was "No good reason for any country to include coal" in recovery plans - India is putting fossil fuel at the forefront of its strategy to turn the pandemic into economic opportunity. India is the world's cheapest producer of solar power and the cost of constructing a new solar plant is 14% less than that of a building a new coal plant.

## Protests against homophobia break out in Poland

> Hi everyone,
> 
> Just some background context, and please note that I am not excusing, just informing with some extra context. 
> 
> So I live in Poland and have a friend who recently arranged a demonstration for George Floyd and there was on the same day Pro-LGBT demonstrations nearby on the same square. The police came and broke up both non violently but took phone numbers, names, and identity documentation numbers down. About a month later they sent out summons/ tickets for creating a demonstration during a pandemic. I would guess that was the argument used in Warsaw right now and it’s liable to resonate with some individuals as covid is spiking in Poland right now. Again, not commenting my opinion, just background information. 
> 
> The person I know who received a summons for demonstrating is an immigrant and besides that that’s all I can say. They missed me when sweeping up the demonstration and were also video taping. This one was in Wroclaw, not Warsaw. 
> 
> Political tensions and angst is pretty high with the re-election of Duda, who has a history of damning homophobic statements including saying that homosexual folks are not people. In the larger cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, Gdańsk, Wroclaw, and Poznan, LGBT is mostly accepted, but it’s gets problematic the further into rural locations you go or put east in places such as Białystock, which saw anti-lgbt demonstrations last year or two years ago.
