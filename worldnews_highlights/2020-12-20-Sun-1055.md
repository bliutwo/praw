`/u/Mamlucky` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kguajf/suicides_among_women_in_japan_and_south_korea/):

> For any clever remarks on women's misery "catching up" with men's. This is a tragedy, not a pissing contest. Mental health and psychiatry are still very taboo in those countries. The intense competition, family values, pressure to provide, and lack of resources for help create the perfect storm for mental health crisis & high suicide rates. The effects of a pandemic didn't create these problems; it just intensified them. Direct excerpt below. 
> 
> Women were not only bearing the brunt of job losses, but also the pressure of additional household chores, she argued. “The burden of childcare and household chores falls mainly on women.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/19/scorned-scientist-now-vindicated-in-her-work-on-how-to-treat-stroke?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other):

> In older people, these key blood vessels can thicken, a condition known as carotid stenosis; if left untreated, this can lead to blockages and trigger a stroke. Despite publication of papers on the effectiveness of these measures, major programmes to use surgical interventions were being introduced across the world, and Abbott came under considerable pressure to stop her attempts to improve stroke prevention. "Anne Abbott's efforts to move away from unnecessary clinical interventions and procedures have shifted stroke prevention methods and improved stroke prevention worldwide - despite coming up against resistance from her academic seniors."

> > judges also gave an early career award to Abbott for her perseverance in challenging traditional surgical and stenting procedures as the main way to treat patients at risk of strokes.
> 
> >”For decades, it was standard practice to operate on people who have carotid stenosis – by cutting open an artery and removing the narrowing,” added Abbott. “More recently, carotid stenting was introduced, and this is even more dangerous than surgery. But my research a decade ago showed, in many cases, these procedures are unnecessary or cause net harm,” added Abbott.

> >For years, [the medical establishment] has attempted to block her work while instead pressing for increasing use of carotid surgery and stents.
> 
> >”I was told not to publish my research findings,” said Abbott. “I was shocked. Then it became hard to submit grant applications to continue my research. People would say ‘yes’ to my proposals, then at the last minute, they would back out. If you can’t put a grant in, it could be the end of your research career.”

`/u/devioustrevor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kgs4wt/atheists_to_save_historic_wooden_german_church/):

> Is the newsworthiness around this mostly from the fact that atheists are saving it?
> 
> Because I'm an atheist and I love old churches.  Many of them are absolutely beautiful buildings and terrific examples of architectural styles rarely utilized anymore.
> 
> The steel-and-glass monstrosities that seem to be many churches nowadays sicken me.  Considering their intended purpose, they come off sort of soulless.

The Dutch public health body, the RIVM, therefore "Recommends that any introduction of this virus strain from the United Kingdom be limited as much as possible by limiting and/or controlling passenger movements."
