## Mexico moves to ban junk food sales to children, citing obesity as coronavirus risk factor

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/19/mexico-kids-junk-food-ban/):

"Covid is accelerating it. We're seeing new lines of junk food introduced, see companies giving out free junk food and calling it disaster relief," he says.
