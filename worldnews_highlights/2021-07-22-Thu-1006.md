Authorities arrested nine people in an early morning raid on Wednesday, including the administrators of Lima's Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen public hospital, according to prosecutor Reynaldo Abia.The scam was uncovered after police received a complaint from the brother of a man suffering from COVID-19 who had been asked for 82,000 soles to obtain an intensive care bed and treatment at the hospital, said Abia.Health Minister Óscar Ugarte told reporters the scam warranted immediate repercussions. Patients must endure a long waiting list for the 80 ICU beds the hospital offers.

## UK food supply chains ‘on the edge of failing', meat industry warns

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-food-supply-chains-edge-failing-meat-industry-says-2021-07-21/):

> LONDON, July 21 - Britain's food supply chains are "Right on the edge of failing" as absence related to COVID-19 has aggravated a critical shortage of labour, a meat industry body said on Wednesday. The shortage of workers affected the meat products that require more labour to produce, he said, meaning those lines would be the first to be cut. On Monday, England's car plants, railways, supermarkets and pubs warned the government that the COVID-19 tracing app, which has told hundreds of thousands of workers to isolate, was wrecking the recovery and pushing supply chains to the brink of collapse.

> 
> I suppose you can’t blame Japan for being so chaotic and disorganized. It’s not like they had any time to plan or anything. Nor did they have any reason to be on the ball about this because of anything on the calendar years in advance.
