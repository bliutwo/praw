## Trudeau admits US heading for post-election “disturbances,” but won’t condemn Trump

Summary of [original article](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/10/trtr-o10.html):

> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been compelled to break his silence on American President Donald Trump's repeated statements that the only legitimate outcome of the November 3 US presidential election is his re-election and that he will not countenance a peaceful transfer of power, whatever the vote tally. Asked at a media event Thursday about the US political crisis, Trudeau refused to condemn Trump for his flouting of the most basic democratic norms and his lies about the integrity of mailed ballots, let alone for plotting to overthrow American democracy. The Star report said the government is bracing itself for the next stage of the US political crisis by focusing on reaching out to US "Powerbrokers," just as it did when Trump repudiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was ultimately replaced by a more expressly US-led continental trade war bloc.

> Understandable, he’s the leader of Canada and needs to keep Canada’s interests in mind. I’m sure behind closed doors he thinks Trump is mental

## New Zealand health experts back reform of 'outdated' cannabis laws

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/new-zealand-health-experts-back-reform-of-outdated-cannabis-laws):

> In an editorial in the New Zealand Medical Journal, specialists from the fields of addiction treatment, public health, health promotion and epidemiology have urged New Zealanders to tick yes in the referendum, days after a poll showed the vote on a knife-edge. "Our prohibition model for cannabis is outdated and doesn't work. Supporting law reform is about reframing cannabis use as a health issue which opens up new, more effective ways of minimising harms caused by this drug." The latest New Zealand Health Survey found that 15%, or 590,000 New Zealand adults used cannabis in the past 12 months.

## ‘Unacceptable’ bacteria levels found on US meat may fuel fears over UK trade deal

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/10/unacceptable-bacteria-levels-found-on-us-meat-may-fuel-fears-over-uk-trade-deal?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other):

> Campaigners fear that a failure to protect UK food standards in law means that a future trade deal with the US might allow more cheaply produced meat to flood the UK market. Trade secretary Liz Truss has argued that parliament would be able to block a trade deal if a majority of MPs wanted a vote on it, but only after the deal had been already been negotiated and signed. The UK's leading expert on food policy Professor Tim Lang said a US trade deal would open the floodgates to worsening standards.

`/u/FinnbarSaunders` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/j9g8aw/unacceptable_bacteria_levels_found_on_us_meat_may/):

> Meanwhile here in the US we shrug and "accept" it, because no one dares to stand up to the meat industry. 
> 
> An industry owned by billionaires who profit by using undocumented labor, lax regulations and apparently unhygienic methods.

> Recently the re-examination of the lack of such legislation has resurfaced when a Tokyo assemblyman claimed that providing legal protection to LGBT individuals would have negative consequences on his district. "If we are to talk about protecting the lesbians and gays by law, then my district will ultimately face ruin." "We, as the assembly members representing Adachi district, formally apologize for the inappropriate comments our colleague, Masateru Shiraishi, made during an assembly session on September 25. We will continue to further our efforts to create a district that supports and upholds the human rights of all our community members."
