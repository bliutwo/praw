> 3 Min Read.TOKYO - Suicide rates in Japan have jumped in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women and children, even though they fell in the first wave when the government offered generous handouts to people, a survey found. The early decline in suicides was affected by such factors as government subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure, the study found. The study, based on health ministry data from November 2016 to October 2020, found the child suicide rate spiked 49% in the second wave, corresponding to the period after a nationwide school closure.

## Hackers alter data to sow mistrust in covid-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/hackers-alter-stolen-regulatory-data-to-sow-mistrust-in-covid-19-vaccine/):

> Last month, the makers of one of the most promising coronavirus vaccines reported that hackers stole confidential documents they had submitted to a European Union regulatory body. Data unlawfully accessed by the hackers "Included internal/confidential email correspondence dating from November, relating to evaluation processes for COVID-19 vaccines," the European Medicines Agency based in Amsterdam said in a statement. Confidential COVID-19 vaccine data has been a hot commodity for hackers since the start of the pandemic.

## India starts world's largest COVID-19 vaccination drive

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/health-india-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-ab830864393480ea6dcc67b0571fc29c):

> Health experts worry that the regulatory shortcut taken to approve the Bharat Biotech vaccine without waiting for concrete data that would show its efficacy in preventing illness from the coronavirus could amplify vaccine hesitancy. India's Health Ministry has bristled at the criticism and says the vaccines are safe, but maintains that health workers will have no choice in deciding which vaccine they would get themselves. While the majority of the COVID-19 vaccine doses have already been snapped up by wealthy countries, COVAX, a U.N.-backed project to supply shots to developing parts of the world, has found itself short of vaccine, money and logistical help.

## Low-paid shun Covid tests because the cost of self-isolating is too high | UK

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/16/low-paid-shun-covid-tests-cost-of-self-isolating-too-high):

> Families on low incomes are avoiding the Covid-19 testing system because they cannot afford to isolate if they get sick, while red tape is hampering access to the government's £500 compensation payments. According to the CIPD, the association of HR professionals, when people on low incomes do self-isolate, they find it difficult to access the NHS Test and Trace support payment scheme. Middlesbrough council said local testing data showed low take-up of PCR swab tests in the most deprived wards in the city, but higher levels of positive tests.

## Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. “Before I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it’s the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.”

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqbn4/canada-goose-workers-allege-unsafe-working-conditions-in-winnipeg-factories):

> Workers connected to a union drive at Canada Goose factories in Winnipeg have come forward with numerous complaints against the luxury jacket brand, alleging an unsafe working environment, the targeted intimidation of pro-union staff, and racial discrimination against the largely immigrant workforce. Workers in Winnipeg are participating in a social media campaign launched by Workers United this week to galvanize support for unionization and expose what they say are unacceptable working conditions. "The majority of the workforce in Canada Goose's Winnipeg factories are immigrant women. Workers report having been forced to deal with low piecemeal rates, and, without a union, no real say over working conditions," a statement released by Canada Goose Workers United Thursday morning said.
