Summary of [original article](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/17/russia-seeks-stop-biden-winning-election-fbi-chief-says/3479200001/):

> Russia is carrying out efforts to sow discord in the U.S. - primarily to hurt Biden - because Moscow views him as part of an anti-Russian American establishment, Wray told lawmakers during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday on threats to the nation. It's an assessment sharply at odds with President Donald Trump, who still dismisses as a hoax the intelligence community's finding that Russia worked to help him win the White House in 2016.U.S. national security agencies haven't yet seen Russia trying to break into election infrastructure as it did in 2016 when it hacked voting databases, Wray said. U.S. agencies previously focused on "Efforts to combat malign foreign influence focused solely on the threat posed by Russia," Wray said, but now the FBI is "Widening its aperture" leading into the Nov. 3 election "To confront malign foreign operations of China, Iran, and other global adversaries."

A video posted on Navalny's Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on Aug. 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances. "Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room," the post said.
