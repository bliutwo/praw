Striking workers from the Minsk Tractor factory, the largest plant in the country, headed an impromptu march to the city centre. Speaking with Tut.by, an independent local publication, striking workers at the factory said had been "Driven crazy" by what they saw.

## Queensland first state in Australia to criminalise gay conversion therapy, after state politicians voted to make “highly destructive and unethical” practice illegal. “Being LGBTIQ is not an affliction or disease that requires medical treatment,” state’s Health Minister, Steven Miles.

Summary of [original article](https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/courts-law/queensland-becomes-first-australian-state-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy/news-story/4a8f7778693c0cff14a7d8208cb6135d):

> Queensland has become the first state in Australia to criminalise gay conversion therapy, after state politicians voted to make the "Highly destructive and unethical" practice illegal. A 2018 landmark report by La Trobe University and the Human Rights Law Centre found conversion therapy is "Pervasive" in Australian faith communities, with at least 10 organisations offering the practice in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian Capital Territory and Victoria have also committed to banning the harmful practice, with the ACT introducing a bill to outlaw conversion therapy for minors on Thursday.

## US sees embarrassing UN defeat over Iran arms embargo proposal - Just one country joins US in vote, highlighting Washington’s isolation as it seeks more drastic action against Iran

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/us-iran-un-arms-embargo-nuclear-deal):

> The US has suffered a humiliating defeat at the United Nations as its proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran won support from only the Dominican Republic at the security council vote. US officials have said that following the defeat of the arms embargo resolution, they would embark within days on a legally controversial tactic in an effort to restore UN sanctions lifted when Iran signed a nuclear deal with major powers in 2015. The US special envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, announced his resignation days before the arms embargo resolution at the UN. If the US proceeds with its snapback plan, it could lead to a situation in which there is no agreement on the status of UN arms sanctions, with the US declaring they are in effect and most other countries insisting there are not.

## Indigenous Mexicans turn inward to survive COVID-19, barricading villages and growing their own food

Summary of [original article](https://theconversation.com/indigenous-mexicans-turn-inward-to-survive-covid-19-barricading-villages-and-growing-their-own-food-142537):

> Oaxaca, one of Mexico's poorest and most ethnically diverse states, is home to numerous Indigenous communities, including the Zapotec people. Working with colleagues at Mexico's Universidad Tecnológica de los Valles Centrales de Oaxaca and scouring online media resources, I find the Zapotec are surviving the pandemic by doing what they've always done when the Mexican government can't, or won't, help them: drawing on local Indigenous traditions of cooperation, self-reliance and isolation. They grow food in their "Milpas," or garden plot, to supplement store-bought fare, and police their own communities with volunteers called "Topiles." With high levels of community trust and a history of self-rule that predates the Spanish conquest, the Zapotec who continue to live in rural Oaxaca neither need nor allow much outside access to their villages.

> Imagine literally reverting to preindustrial agriculture to deal with coronavirus.

> And being better off than the united states for doing so.
> 
> Edit: if your stance falls along the lines of "ANYONE WHO SAYS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE US HAS AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX" you have a superiority complex. Like, borderline "aryan master race" superiority complex.
> 
> If your stance falls along the lines of "HAHA MEXICO ISNT DOING BETTER THAN THE US" while youre ignoring 5,000,000 infected and 160,000 dead, you're delusional.
> 
> Stay mad, racist americans.
