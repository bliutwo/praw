## India wins first Olympic medal in athletics in over 100 years

Summary of [original article](https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2021/08/07/olympics-neeraj-chopra-scripts-history-with-gold-in-javelin-throw.html):

> Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra scripted history by becoming the first Indian in over 100 years to win an Olympic medal in athletics, when he won the gold in men's javelin throw in Tokyo, today. A pre-tournament medal contender, the 23-year-old Chopra fuelled country's expectations by topping the qualification round with a stunning first round throw of 86.59m. Three track and field athletes were part of the five-member Indian team at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium - the other two being wrestlers. Vetter, who had earlier said that Chopra will find it tough to beat him in the Olympics but had himself crossed the automatic qualification mark with a 85.64m final throw in the third attempt, was eliminated after the first round of throws.

Earlier on Friday, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco criticized Bolsonaro for his attacks on the Supreme Court and offered to mediate, saying the president's insults against Barroso were unacceptable.
