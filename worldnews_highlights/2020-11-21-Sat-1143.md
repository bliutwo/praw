## Women activists, political prisoners ‘sexually assaulted, tortured and executed in Saudi Arabia’ jails

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-prisoners-womens-human-rights-b1745241.html):

> The study, which comes days before Saudi Arabia hosts the G20 on Saturday, notes 27 political prisoners were women's rights activists - saying six of them had been sexually assaulted. "Except at home in Saudi Arabia, where she languishes in a maximum-security prison. In prison, my sister has been tortured and degraded, and sexually abused. As long as women inside of Saudi Arabia cannot safely speak, it is the duty of the international community to raise its voice on their behalf." "This weekend Saudi authorities will talk up the reforms championed by imprisoned activists to garner business opportunities and political acclaim. The activists who continue to fight for human rights in Saudi Arabia are the true voices for reform, and they should be listened to, not locked up."

## Nazi concentration camp guard to be deported from America to Germany

Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12383974):

> A 94-year-old former Nazi concentration camp guard who lived undiscovered in the US for decades is to be deported to Germany, where he could face prosecution, after his appeal against a deportation order was rejected this week. Friedrich Karl Berger succeeded in covering up his role as a concentration camp guard for more than 70 years and still receives a pension for his wartime service in the German navy. German prosecutors have yet to announce whether Berger will face charges on his return to the country, but a number of elderly former concentration camp guards have been tried and convicted in recent years.

## We've now found microplastics on the very highest and lowest points on Earth. Mount Everest is littered with them. They have also been found in human poop, Arctic ice, and the Mariana Trench 36,000 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean.

> 
> They all have names and faces. This tragedy was purposefully committed for profit and it's frankly unacceptable for it to go unpunished. They need to be tried and held accountable.

## Simulations suggest geoengineering would not stop global warming if greenhouse gasses continue to increase | Computer simulations suggest that using geoengineering to cool the planet would not be enough to overcome greenhouse effects if emissions continue at the current rate

Summary of [original article](https://phys.org/news/2020-11-simulations-geoengineering-global-greenhouse-gasses.html):

> A trio of researchers, two with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the other the California Institute of Technology, developed computer simulations suggesting that using geoengineering to cool the planet would not be enough to overcome greenhouse effects if emissions continue at the current rate. Geoengineering to reduce global warming would involve emitting particulate material into the stratosphere to reflect heat from the sun back into space.

## Pakistan okays locally developed AI software that uses chest X-ray to detect Covid-19 in under a minute

Summary of [original article](https://www.dawn.com/news/1591603/drap-okays-locally-developed-ai-software-that-uses-chest-x-ray-to-detect-covid-19-in-under-a-minute):

> The Cov-raid website says the artificial intelligence technology was developed by "Creating a data repository of chest X-rays for Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 detection", adding that the software "Requires a chest X-ray image as an input for the detection of Covid-19 positive or negative patients in less than one minute". A similar algorithm was developed by a team of researchers at the University of Minnesota in the United States last month "That can evaluate chest X-rays to diagnose possible cases of Covid-19 within seconds". Another such software was developed in China earlier this year by Axial AI which analysed Computed Tomography imagery in seconds.

> Important to note that this doesnt give you a definitive yes or no diagnosis for COVID-19. What is does, at least with the form I'm familiar with, is give you a risk score called the PXS Score which is a measure of the likeliness that a patient might have it. Doctors then have to take this information along with other markers and determine a diagnosis. It is not the end all diagnosis.
