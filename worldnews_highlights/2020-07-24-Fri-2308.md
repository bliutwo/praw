"World Lacrosse fully respects the contributions and status of the Iroquois Nationals within international lacrosse. That is why the Haudenosaunee Nation, which gave the world The Creator's Game, is recognized as a full member of World Lacrosse, and why the Iroquois Nationals have been eligible to compete in every World Championship event conducted by World Lacrosse," the tweet said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/24/894571311/protesters-in-russias-far-east-challenge-putins-authority-demand-his-resignation):

> Protesters In Russia's Far East Challenge Putin's Authority, Demand His Resignation The arrest of a popular regional governor has led to protests demanding his release. Amid the pandemic and an economic downturn, the protests pose an additional challenge for President Vladimir Putin. "Putin personally - and Putin's stooges who run the Far East - hate Khabarovsk region and its inhabitants because time and again, they lose elections there," opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in a video posted Thursday that was widely shared on social media.

`/u/Brohozombie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hx9v27/protesters_in_russias_far_east_challenge_putins/):

> Imagine the courage it takes to be a protester against Putin in Russia. I know Trump tries to act like a dictator, but he has nothing on Vlad when it comes to mysterious disappearances and accidents.

> According to Der Spiegel, the pair form part of a network founded by Eckhardt, who also lives in Cape Breton. Eckhardt, Der Spiegel reports, is a so-called Reichsbuerger - a person who feels the modern German state that arose after the Nazi defeat doesn't have legitimacy. Der Spiegel reports that at the end of 2019, Interpol staff based in Ottawa informed German intelligence of Eckhardt's activities in this country, but Herman and Popp have denied links to Eckhardt.

## Australia labels China's claims to South China Sea illegal

Summary of [original article](https://www.theage.com.au/world/asia/australia-labels-china-s-claims-to-south-china-sea-illegal-20200725-p55fde.html):

> Australia has rejected China's claim to key parts of the South China Sea, joining the United States in branding the territorial ambitions unlawful at the United Nations. "The Australian government encourages all claimants in the South China Sea, including China, to clarify their maritime claims and resolve their differences peacefully, in accordance with international law." "Most concerning for me is the People's Liberation Army continues its aggressive behaviour in the East and South China Seas, including sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat, harassing Malaysian oil and gas development, escorting Chinese fishing fleets into Indonesia's claimed Exclusive Economic Zone and militarising occupied features in direct contravention of China's commitments under international law," he said.

## U.N. Warns America Against 'Excessive Force' as Portland Officers Seen Shoving Medics to the Ground

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/un-warns-america-against-excessive-force-portland-officers-seen-shoving-medics-ground-1520292?utm_source=Public&utm_medium=Feed&utm_campaign=Distribution):

> The United Nations, on Friday, urged America to avoid using excessive force against protesters and journalists, following a viral video that shows volunteer medics being shoved to the ground by police officers in Portland, Oregon. During the news briefing, Throssell also urged authorities to ensure that federal and local police were "Clearly identified," after photos have shown officers covering their badge numbers when using excessive force against protesters. In Portland, protesters and police officers have continued to clash, and a recently viral video shows two volunteer medics being pushed to the ground by law enforcement officials during a protest.

`/u/plopseven` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hx373w/un_warns_america_against_excessive_force_as/):

> I watched the video of police beating medics with red plus sign tags all over them.  On their backpacks and shoulders and everything.
> 
> If the police can’t recognize medics, they should not be police.  This is a crime in war, and even worse when it’s against your own citizens.

## Ikea sued by Polish government for sacking homophobe who told colleagues gay people deserved death

Summary of [original article](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/23/ikea-poland-sued-lawsuit-gay-homophobic-employee-tomasz-k/):

> Ikea is being sued by the government in Poland for allegedly infringing upon an employee's religious rights after he was fired for making horrific anti-LGBT+ comments. Poland says Ikea 'must respect religious freedom'. Ikea said at the time that the employee had expressed an opinion "In a way that could affect the rights and dignity of LGBT + people".

`/u/sanchess1987` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hx3vf0/ikea_sued_by_polish_government_for_sacking/):

> Ok, well first of all its not ikea that is being sued, but the HR person who made the action on ikeas behalf. Doesnt really change anything but worth pointing out.
> 
> The problem in general is that Polands homophobic actions are being disguised as actions against lgbt ideology, not people. That is how it is being sold. Its the ideology that is bad and it leads to pedophilia. They sell this idea on emotions that  some bad people, most likely germany, are putting lgbt agenda onto childrens books, spoiling them from their childhoods and rotting them making them unable to grow into healthy families later on. 
> 
>  Im not joking - thats what this is at the moment.
> 
> I need to stress - the idea is it is not a fight against gays, just lgbt. Gays are fine. And people are buying it.
> 
> Moving on onto problem in the article - the guy quoted bible verses stating that gays should be drowned /punished by death. He quoted 2 of those. Quotes (in polish) below:
> 
> : "biada temu, przez którego przychodzą zgorszenia, lepiej by mu było uwiązać kamień młyński u szyi i pogrążyć go w głębokościach morskich" 
> 
> 
>  "Ktokolwiek obcuje cieleśnie z mężczyzną, tak jak się obcuje z kobietą, popełnia obrzydliwość. Obaj będą ukarani śmiercią, a ich krew spadnie na nich".
> 
> Now, remember when i said that government is successful by hiding its homophobic agenda? So their problem is that IKEA fired this man because for his religious beliefs, not because of threat of literally killing them. This is the main argument and this is going to be the course of how this legal case will be recognised.
> 
> Poland is becoming scary. It is disgusting of what is being promoted and what is being banned.
> 
> Thank you for reading.
