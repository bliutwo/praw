## Apple threatens to leave UK if court forces company to pay fee for the technology used in its iPhones

Summary of [original article](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-9775603/Apples-threat-quit-Britain-5bn-patent-row.html):

> American tech giant Apple has threatened to quit the UK over a $7billion legal row. Mr Justice Meade suggested this was unlikely, saying: 'There is no evidence Apple is really going to say no , is there? There is no evidence it is even remotely possible Apple will leave the UK market?'. Kathleen Fox Murphy of EIP Legal, representing Optis, said: 'Everyone thinks about Apple as the market leader in smartphones, but Apple has to buy in most of the technology in an iPhone.

> It's weird to see the comments here suddenly supporting patent trolls.
> 
> PanOptis, the parent company of Optis Cellular Technology, doesn't develop a damn thing. All it does is acquire overly broad tech patents that overlap with key functions of technology, which it then tries to use to get fees for every device that offers those functions.
> 
> In effect, they want to levy a tax on the sale of every device for using technology to which they contributed absolutely nothing. And that's a tax that ultimately falls on the shoulders of consumers.
> 
> Their goal is for your next smartphone to be $50-100 more expensive, with all of that money going straight into their pockets. And in return for that price increase, you get absolutely nothing.
> 
> They're parasites who exist by the grace of flawed patent systems. They contribute nothing whatsoever to humanity.

## Pope reappears after surgery, backs free universal health care

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-francis-appears-public-first-time-since-surgery-2021-07-11/):

> ROME, July 11 - Pope Francis, seeming in good overall condition, appeared in public on Sunday for the first time since undergoing intestinal surgery a week ago and made a plea for free universal healthcare. "It was a great joy to see the pope again ... his voice was a little shaky but the pope is always the pope and we wanted to be here," said an Italian priest who identified himself as Father Massimiliano. According to the World Health Organization, universal health coverage means that all have access to health services they need without financial hardship.

> >"In these days that I have been in hospital, I saw once more how important it is to have a good healthcare system that is accessible to all, as it exists in Italy and in other countries," he said.
> 
> >"A health service that is free and guarantees good service accessible to all ... This precious good should not be lost. It must be maintained and everyone should be committed to this. Because everyone needs it ...," he said.
> 
> So it's not like he's backing countries getting it (because damn near every country already has it) he's saying they have to fight to keep it.
> 
> Meanwhile in the US...

> I wish stories like this got more traction. People aren’t scared of the death rate of COVID, which is the only thing the media talks about. Long haul COVID has been known about for a while, but lots of people still aren’t aware of it or how bad it is. Long haul COVID is the real threat.

## Majority of Brazilians support impeaching Bolsonaro, poll shows

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/majority-brazilians-support-impeaching-bolsonaro-poll-shows-2021-07-10/):

> RIO DE JANEIRO, July 10 - For the first time, a majority of Brazilians support impeaching President Jair Bolsonaro, according to a poll released on Saturday, as serious graft allegations related to vaccine procurement hit the right-wing leader's already battered image. According to the survey by Datafolha, 54% of Brazilians support a proposed move by the country's lower house to open impeachment proceedings against Bolsonaro, while 42% oppose it. In a separate Datafolha poll, released on Thursday, 51% of Brazilians said they disapproved of Bolsonaro, the highest figure since he took office in January 2019.In recent weeks, Brasilia has been rocked by allegations that federal officials solicited bribes to fast-track and overpay for the Covaxin vaccine developed by India's Bharat Biotech.

`/u/cambeiu` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ohpp71/majority_of_brazilians_support_impeaching/):

> As long as Bolsonaro has something he can barter with Congress (e.g. discretionary budget and key government positions), he will not be impeached.
> 
> Many non-Brazilian redditors think Bolsonaro is some kind of all powerful dictator or strongman, when in reality despite his autocratic personality, he is incredibly weak politically. Since the new Brazilian constitution was drafted in1988 after the end of the military dictatorship, the powers of the executive branch have been severely curtailed and it is now arguably the weakest of all the branches of the government.
> 
> Bolsonaro himself is an inept politician who spent most of his inexpressive political career in the lower house. He got elected as a "meme" candidate because people were fed up with the status quo.He does not know how to make alliances and build coalitions. His administration went thru 16 ministers in 2.5 years, a record in Brazilian history. He pissed off his own party and was expelled. He is currently without party as no existing party wants him. He has virtually alienated most of his past allies and now he is backed only by a cradle of sycophants. Even the vice-president, an Army general, does not talk to him anymore.
> 
> Early this year, he tried to rally the military and imply that he could do a coup, in order to try to intimidate Congress and the judiciary, but all he achieved was to have the Minister of Defense and all joint chiefs of staff [to resign in unison in protest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/brazil-military-chiefs-resign-bolsonaro-fires-defense-minister), in a clear signal to the entire country that the military would not back him in any coup attempt.
> 
> Right now he is giving away key position in his administration to other parties in exchange for delaying impeachment procedures. He is virtually hostage of Congress and they are squeezing every concession out of him in exchange for his political survival.His environment minister, who is under criminal investigation by the Brazilian Federal police, has just resigned.
> 
> The only reason Bolsonaro has not been criminals indicted yet is due to the fact that he is president. Once he is out of office, he will face an avalanche of criminal charges and he knows this. So he will barter out everything he can to avoid being impeached.

## ‘They will never let go’: Isis fighters regroup in the heart of Iraq

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/11/isis-fighters-regroup-in-the-heart-of-iraq):

> "There is little or no trust in the government, and local communities are collectively punished and treated as members of Isis until proven innocent," the tribal leader said. One man disclosed that Isis militants had passed through the village in recent weeks. The convoy marched on, headed now towards a series of canals and ditches that Isis had been using as a makeshift shelter and communication network.

## Woman, 90, In Belgium Dies After She Was Infected With 2 Covid Variants At Same Time: Researchers

Summary of [original article](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/90-year-old-woman-infected-with-two-different-covid-variants-at-the-same-time-say-researchers-2483879):

> A 90-year-old woman who died after falling ill with Covid-19 was infected with both the Alpha and Beta variants of the coronavirus at the same time, researchers in Belgium said Sunday, adding that the rare phenomenon may be underestimated. "Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from two different people," said molecular biologist Anne Vankeerberghen from the OLV Hospital who led the research. In January, scientists in Brazil reported that two people had been simultaneously infected with two different strains of the coronavirus, but the study has yet to be published in a scientific journal.
