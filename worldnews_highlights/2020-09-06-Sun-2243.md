Summary of [original article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2020/09/06/films/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-film/):

> Activists are calling for a boycott of Disney's live-action "Mulan" remake, citing a social media post from the lead actress in support of Hong Kong police. "Because Disney kowtows to Beijing, and because Liu Yifei openly and proudly endorses police brutality in Hong Kong, I urge everyone who believes in human rights to #BoycottMulan," Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong tweeted on Friday. Liu reportedly shared a social media post in August 2019 amid widespread protests in the former British territory, with the caption, "I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.".

> The reservation against the COVID vaccine isn't entirely founded in crazy anti-vax sentiment. This scientific process used to verify safety and efficacy of a vaccine have been heavily expedited and there are numerous obvious political and humane incentives to push it to market earlier than it otherwise would. This makes people quite skeptical, rightfully so, on its safety. Many of them, myself included, aren't saying they would NEVER get a vaccine. They're saying they wouldn't immediately get the first one that gets rushed to market right when it's made available.

Devermont said Senegal's success in tackling Ebola gave them a blueprint to respond to COVID "Right out of the gate." And he noted that Sall enjoys high confidence across Senegal, ensuring that people take his warnings and the government restrictions seriously.

## German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that an "unscrupulous" President Donald Trump was trying to sow doubt about the US presidential election by urging his supporters to vote twice, which is illegal

Summary of [original article](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/german-foreign-minister-heiko-maas-trump-vote-twice-remark-unscruplous-2291227):

> Trump has repeatedly raised doubt over whether he would accept defeat in November's election. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Sunday that an "Unscrupulous" President Donald Trump was trying to sow doubt about the US presidential election by urging his supporters to vote twice, which is illegal. Trump said earlier this week that voters could use a mail-in vote - which he has slammed as a ruse to rig the election against him - and then also cast a vote at a polling station as a guarantee, with officials left to decide which of the ballots to count.
