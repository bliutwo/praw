## Lithuanians to form human chain from Vilnius to Medininkai in solidarity with Belarusians

Summary of [original article](https://www.baltictimes.com/lithuanians_to_form_human_chain_from_vilnius_to_medininkai_in_solidarity_with_belarusians/):

> VILNIUS - A human chain called "The Freedom Way" will be formed in Lithuania from Vilnius to Medininkai on Sunday in solidarity with Belarus' civil society fighting for democratic changes in the country. Zivile Tiskeviciute, head of communication at Laisves TV that's behind the campaign, says some 50,000 people plan to join the Freedom Way on August 23, on the anniversary of the Baltic Way that took place in 1989 when over a million people formed a human chain spanning Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to demand an end to the Soviet occupation of their countries. The Freedom Way will be then followed by a concern and TV marathon in the courtyard of Medininkai Castle and collected funds will be given to the BY Help organization that's been helping injured, detained and persecuted Belarusians and their families since 2017.

`/u/regisphilbin222` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/if5ums/lithuanians_to_form_human_chain_from_vilnius_to/):

> To everyone wondering what the point is, as the article explains it’s a throwback to the Baltic Way of 1989. It was a peaceful protest against Soviet rule where citizens of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia linked hands to form an unbroken chain across the three countries. At the time, it was a very powerful visual that raised the countries’ grievances to a higher international level and established their solidarity, humanizing and accelerating their struggle for independence, and Lithuania was able to successfully declare independence seven months later.It has inspired other acts, including the human chain (Hong Kong Way) last year protesting against the CCP in Hong Kong.

## Over 100,000 protesters gather to pressure Belarus president to resign

Summary of [original article](https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/over-100000-protesters-gather-to-pressure-belarus-president-to-resign/):

> MINSK, Belarus - More than 100,000 protesters demanding the resignation of Belarus' authoritarian president rallied Sunday in a vast square in the capital, keeping up the massive outburst of dissent that has shaken the country since a disputed presidential election two weeks ago. Protesters say the official election results, in which Lukashenko reportedly received 80% of the vote, are fraudulent. Lukashenko has consistently repressed any opposition during his time in office and weariness with his hardline rule, as well as dismay over the country's deteriorating economy and Lukashenko's cavalier dismissal of the coronavirus pandemic, appear to have galvanized opponents.
