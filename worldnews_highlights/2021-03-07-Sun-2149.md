## Nine killed after Duterte’s order to ‘finish off’ communists

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/7/philippines-deadly-operation-after-order-to-kill-communists):

> At least nine activists have been killed following simultaneous police raids in the northern Philippines that came just two days after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered government forces to "Kill" and "Finish off" all communist rebels in the country. "I've told the military and the police that if they find themselves in an armed encounter with the communist rebels, kill them, make sure you really kill them and finish them off if they are alive," Duterte said. In recent months, a number of activists, lawyers and doctors have been shot dead after they were tagged in public and on social media as communist sympathisers and active communist rebels.

## 'Catastrophic': UK has lost 90% of seagrass meadows, study finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/04/catastrophic-uk-has-lost-90-of-seagrass-meadows-study-finds):

> The UK has lost more than 90% of the lush seagrass meadows that once surrounded the nation, research has found. "The catastrophic losses documented in this research are alarming, but offer a snapshot of the potential of this habitat if efforts are made to protect and restore seagrass meadows across the UK," said Alix Green at University College London, who led the work. "If they are left undisturbed, seagrass soils will persist for thousands of years, and act as permanent carbon storage. Seagrass meadows can rebound, if allowed to, and it used to be everywhere, so there are limitless opportunities to build it back." The Seagrass Ocean Rescue project is already planting millions of seeds on the shallow seafloor in Dale Bay, Pembrokeshire.

## Swiss ‘burka ban’ poised for a tight victory

Summary of [original article](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--burka-ban--vote-too-close-to-call/46420534):

> A decade after a national vote banning the construction of minarets in the country, the burka ban will thus introduce a clause in the Swiss constitution banning the wearing of face coverings - including the Islamic burka and niqab - in public spaces. As part of their argument, government and parliament backed a "Counter-proposal" that would come into force if the outright ban was rejected: this law would also have banned face coverings, but only for the purpose of identification, in public administrations or in public transport. In November 2009, 57.5% of voters accepted another people's initiative - proposed by the same committee behind the burka vote - to ban the building of minarets in the country: a result that went against the predictions of opinion polls and which came as a shock to the political establishment.

`/u/Con-Struct` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/lzq4qs/swiss_burka_ban_poised_for_a_tight_victory/):

> The Swiss are very Nationalistic and largely conservative. In one Canton (Appenzel), women only got the vote in 1990. I’ve seen really racist and xenophobic political posters here. They’re not hateful people though, they feel like their culture is threatened. Their Nationalism is very deeply ingrained. My Swiss wife received a Swiss Army knife from her town when she turned 18, as did all 18 year olds. Their economic success is largely due to them behaving like they’re an island. My Swiss wife literally feels guilty if we hop over the border to do shopping in Germany where it’s far cheaper. The young generation are largely liberal and don’t support the ban. But there are a fuck load of old people here. They live forever.
