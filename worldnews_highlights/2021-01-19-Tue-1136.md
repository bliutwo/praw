## The UK will introduce a new visa at the end of January that will give 5.4 million Hong Kong residents - a staggering 70% of the territory's population - the right to come and live in the UK

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-55357495):

> Britain has allowed Hong Kong residents like Mr Li and his family to move to the UK even before the new visa comes into force. The family are excited about their new life, but others have arrived with less of a sense of starting something good as fleeing something bad. One person who did not want to be identified came to Britain recently after taking part in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019. In the end, the number of Hong Kong residents emigrating to Britain might depend on how much more Beijing decides to squeeze.

> For those wondering this is for **British** Overseas Nationals. Yes that's right, a significant portion of Hong Kongers have a type of British nationality, and it's them and their kids and spouses who will be allowed to come to the UK. These people are also entitled to British Passports, they always have been; which is kind of a joke because the passport doesn't give you right to live in the UK.

## Pink seesaws across US-Mexico border named Design of the Year 2020

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/19/pink-seesaws-across-us-mexico-border-named-design-of-the-year-2020):

> A collection of bright pink seesaws that allowed people to interact over the US-Mexico border has won the prestigious Design of the Year award, with its creators saying they hoped the work encourages people to build bridges between communities. The Teeter Totter Wall, which bridged across El Paso in Texas and Ciudad Juárez in Mexico during a 40-minute session, was described as not only feeling "Symbolically important" but also highlighting "The possibility of things" by the judging panel. According to the US Customs and Border Protection more than 450 miles of wall had been erected during Trump's tenure, however much of the construction replaced barriers that were already in place.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-parler-russia/parler-partially-reappears-with-support-from-russian-technology-firm-idUSKBN29N23N):

> 3 Min Read.(Reuters) - Parler, a social media website and app popular with the American far right, has partially returned online with the help of a Russian-owned technology company. Parler CEO John Matze and representatives of DDoS-Guard did not reply to requests for comment. Parler critics said it was a potential security risk for it to depend on a Russian company, as well as an odd choice for a site popular with self-described patriots.

## Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was arrested on his return to Russia last weekend, released an investigation Tuesday into a lavish Black Sea property he claimed is owned by President Vladimir Putin

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210119-navalny-releases-investigation-into-putin-s-palace):

> Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was arrested on his return to Russia last weekend, released an investigation Tuesday into a lavish Black Sea property he claimed is owned by President Vladimir Putin. The investigation claims that Russia's Federal Security Service owns some 7,000 hectares of land surrounding the property and that the complex was financed by Putin's close allies, including Igor Sechin, chief of Russian oil giant Rosneft, and billionaire tycoon Gennady Timchenko. The new investigation, which ends on a call for Russians to rise up against the authorities, echoes a 2017 YouTube video in which Navalny accused then Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of controlling a luxury property empire.

## Batteries capable of fully charging in five minutes have been produced in a factory for the first time, marking a significant step towards electric cars becoming as fast to charge as filling up petrol or diesel vehicles.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/19/electric-car-batteries-race-ahead-with-five-minute-charging-times):

> Batteries capable of fully charging in five minutes have been produced in a factory for the first time, marking a significant step towards electric cars becoming as fast to charge as filling up petrol or diesel vehicles. Using available charging infrastructure, StoreDot is aiming to deliver 100 miles of charge to a car battery in five minutes in 2025."The number one barrier to the adoption of electric vehicles is no longer cost, it is range anxiety," said Doron Myersdorf, CEO of StoreDot. Now the charging stations and grids that supply them need to be upgraded, he said, which is why they are working with BP. "BP has 18,200 forecourts and they understand that, 10 years from now, all these stations will be obsolete, if they don't repurpose them for charging - batteries are the new oil."

> Recharge 1000 times but lose 20% capacity. The batteries are getting better and better but still a way to go.
