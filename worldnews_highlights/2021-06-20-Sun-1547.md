## More than 100 celebrities, prominent Canadians ask B.C. premier to preserve remaining old-growth forest

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/old-growth-forest-letter-to-premier-john-horgan-canopy-1.6071822):

> Campaign organizers are demanding an immediate stop to logging of the remaining old growth, saying B.C. used to be a place where trees swayed at 76 metres tall and now only 2.7 per cent of the large-tree old-growth forests remain. The Ministry of Forests says old-growth forest covers some 13.7 million hectares of the province - nearly 20 per cent of B.C. forests. "B.C.'s beautiful ancient forests are part of what makes our province a great place to live and we owe it to future generations to protect them. The path towards managing B.C.'s forests will be guided by science and by government-to-government engagement with First Nations."

> Nestle is taking our water for pennies and creating a massive ecological problem for the rest of the world to clean up while they pocket the money.
> 
> The oil sands is the dirtiest oil on the planet which we sell at below market rates because we don't have our own refineries.  It's so expensive to get oil out of the oil sands that if oil falls below a certain price per barrel the whole oil sands shuts down.  For this we have destroyed water sheds, sickened/destroyed communities, and another massive ecological problem which will last for 1000s of years has been created.
> 
> Whatever money we as the Canadian people are making in the short term is not worth the long term problems that come with that short term money.  I personally am going to be very vocal with my local politicians and then I'm making appearances wherever they speak to bring up these issues.  Everyone else should too, the best things in life used to be free, but then our politicians sold them for pennies and now I'm pissed.

## New oilfield in African wilderness threatens lives of 130,000 elephants

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/20/new-oilfield-in-african-wilderness-threatens-lives-of-130000-elephants):

> Tens of thousands of African elephants are under threat from plans for a massive new oilfield in one of the continent's last great wildernesses, experts have warned. "There's a profound irony here. Here we are with hundreds of elephants dying from an algae bloom caused by climate change, and a few kilometres away they want to start drilling for yet more oil." Last month, the International Energy Agency said the exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.Experts say that extracting billions of barrels of fossil fuels from a giant new oil field in Africa would directly contradict that finding - with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate emergency.

> *The Namibian government said only exploratory licences had so far been granted which did not allow any production operations.*

> No one believes that 'exploration' is all that these companies intend to do. With an estimated 60 - 120 billion barrels, they will eventually start 'production operations'.

## UN blasts world leaders for failing to seal £72bn-a-year deal on climate

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/20/un-blasts-world-leaders-for-failing-to-seal-72bn-a-year-deal-on-climate):

> The head of climate change at the UN has warned that world leaders are still "Far away" from securing a deal to limit the disastrous effects of global heating, with less than five months to go before a key summit in Glasgow. The UN climate conference, opening on 31 October in Glasgow, is considered to be of special importance in the battle against global warming, which is now melting ice sheets, raising sea levels, destroying coral reefs and disrupting weather systems across the planet. Johnson has to muster the world to significant climate finance commitments, purposing development finance and detail behind the global Marshall plan that President Biden calls Build Back Better World.

## National security adviser: US preparing more Russia sanctions over Navalny poisoning and imprisonment

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/20/politics/jake-sullivan-russia-sanctions-navalny-cnntv/index.html):

> The Biden administration is preparing to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. "We are preparing another package of sanctions to apply in this case," Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union." "We've shown all along the way that we are not going to pull our punches, whether it's on solar winds, or election interference, or Navalny when it comes to responding to Russia's harmful activities." Sullivan said the sanctions will come once the US can "Ensure that we are getting the right targets," adding, "When we do that, we will impose further sanctions with respect to chemical weapons."
