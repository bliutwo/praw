> Literally every country in the world has asked for an end of the trade embargo on Cuba except for the US, Israel and some Pacific Islands. It is the longest embargo in modern history and a relic of the past, its first  iteration dating to March 14, 1958, more than 60 years now, and just 13 years after WW2 ended. It is so old 90% of the current  global population was born after the embargo.

## Beijing furious after US warship sails near Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in South China Sea

Summary of [original article](http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/us-warship-sails-near-disputed-paracels-on-anniversary-of-tribunal-ruling-on-south):

> BEIJING - Beijing is furious after a US warship sailed near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in the South China Sea on Monday, on the fifth anniversary of an international tribunal ruling that repudiated much of China's territorial claims in the region. The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and its latest action comes on the fifth anniversary of the Permanent Court of Arbitration's ruling that rejected much of Beijing's claim to the waterway. "We also reaffirm that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US mutual defence commitments under Article IV of the 1951 US-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty," he added.

## Indigenous peoples patrolling the Peruvian Amazon equipped with smartphones and satellite data were able to drastically reduce illegal deforestation, according to the results of an experiment published Monday

> Indigenous peoples patrolling the Peruvian Amazon equipped with smartphones and satellite data were able to drastically reduce illegal deforestation, according to the results of an experiment published Monday. The new study was led by Researchers from New York University and Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with Rainforest Foundation US and the Indigenous People's Organization of the Eastern Amazon. "The whole point is to put the deforestation information into the hands of those most affected by its consequences and who can take action to stop it," said Tom Bewick, Peru country director for RFUS. Over the course of the two-year study, the communities that carried out patrols using satellite data prevented the destruction of an estimated 456 hectares of rainforest, avoiding the release of more than 234,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
