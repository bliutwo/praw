## Xi tells UN China will stop funding coal projects overseas

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210921-xi-tells-un-china-will-stop-funding-coal-projects-overseas):

> China will stop funding coal projects overseas, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday, ending a major source of support for a dirty energy contributing to climate change. China has gone on an infrastructure-building blitz around the world as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, and until now has been open to coal projects. China has promised to peak coal consumption by 2030 and go carbon neutral by 2060.

> This is a pretty big deal. For context [this](https://endcoal.org/finance-tracker/) is the current financing for coal around the world. China can single-handedly end coal development with this one single step.
> 
> Edit: This link talks about the finances only, but the direct quote from the article is "China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low carbon energy and **will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad**". This means that Chinese companies won't even build these anymore for countries with money who don't need financing. The financial data is just meant to show that China is the world's biggest player in this area and this pivot is a monumental change.

## Germany warns of lost U.S. trust as France wins EU support

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-weighs-australia-options-urges-britain-restore-trust-2021-09-21/):

> BRUSSELS, Sept 21 - Germany joined France on Tuesday in berating the United States for negotiating a security pact in secret with Australia and Britain that cost Paris a lucrative defence deal, while the EU's top official said such behaviour was unacceptable. Her EU executive asked for preparatory EU discussions for the U.S. trade and technology council to be taken off Wednesday's agenda, EU diplomats said. France said it was assessing all options in response to Australia's scrapping of a $40 billion submarine contract last week, while its biggest EU ally, Germany, rallied behind it, saying Washington and Canberra had damaged trust between allies that would be difficult to rebuild.

`/u/MrTigim` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/pshvi0/germany_warns_of_lost_us_trust_as_france_wins_eu/):

> People are loosing sight of what the issue is here. It's not about the submarine project being cancelled. 
> 
> It's is about the US, UK and Aus, going behind the backs of France to make their own defense collaboration, without even a discussion with France. Not a word of it was mentioned even though France would most likely been heavily in favor of joining the pact. It's crazy the US of all places, could drop such a decision, especially when its not even the unpredictable Trump in office anymore

## An Ancient Tablet, Stolen Then Acquired By Hobby Lobby, Will Be Returned To Iraq

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/21/1039380004/gilgamesh-dream-tablet-hobby-lobby-iraq-return):

> The Ancient Gilgamesh Dream Tablet Will Be Returned To Iraq Known as the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, it was looted from Iraq and made its way through several hands before Hobby Lobby purchased it for the Museum of the Bible in 2014. Known as the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, it was acquired by the company Hobby Lobby in 2014 for display in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. U.S. authorities seized it in 2019, saying it was stolen and needed to be returned. During the Gulf War in 1991, Saddam Hussein's regime lost control of regions of Iraq and several regional museums were looted of historic objects, possibly including the tablet.

## Mexico's Supreme Court on Monday struck down a part of the country's health law that allowed medical personnel to refuse to carry out abortions on the grounds of conscientious objection

Summary of [original article](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1234723.shtml):

> Mexico's Supreme Court on Monday struck down a part of the country's health law that allowed medical personnel to refuse to carry out abortions on the grounds of conscientious objection. The ruling is the latest in a series by the top court removing legal hurdles to abortion in the conservative Latin American country. In earlier September, the Supreme Court ruled that women should not be punished for abortion, opening the way for them to access the procedure across the country without fear of being prosecuted.

`/u/Stomatin` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/pskher/mexicos_supreme_court_on_monday_struck_down_a/):

> >The article was "a blank check to deny health services, particularly in the case of abortion, in violation of other human rights that the constitution recognizes," said court president Arturo Zaldivar.
> 
> >At the same time, the court recognized medical personnel's right to conscientious objection and scheduled another session on Tuesday to define guidelines for exercising it.
> 
> Good on Mexican supreme court. The ruling was decided by unanimous vote as well. Texas needs to learn from their southern neighbour.

## With No U.S. Support, Leaders of Afghan Resistance Flee the Country

Summary of [original article](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/21/afghanistan-taliban-ahmad-massoud-flee/?utm_campaign=theintercept&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social):

> Ahmad Massoud, son of the late Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, fled to Tajikistan shortly after the Taliban seized control of the Panjshir Valley on September 6, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official, a Pentagon consultant, and two former senior Afghan government officials. Massoud was joined a few days later by Amrullah Saleh, the former Afghan vice president and longtime intelligence chief, who left Afghanistan by helicopter, the senior U.S. official and two former Afghan officials said. Saleh, who once worked as an aide to Ahmad Shah Massoud and served many years in senior positions in Afghanistan's U.S.-backed government, tweeted last month that he was the legal successor to former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, citing Ghani's decision to flee to the United Arab Emirates.
