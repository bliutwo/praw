## Brazil fines Apple $2 million for not including charger with iPhone 12 series

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/mobile/news/brazil-fines-apple-2-million-for-not-including-charger-with-iphone-12-series/articleshow/81613304.cms):

> Brazilian consumer watchdog has fined Apple $2 million for not including a charger in the newly-launched iPhone 12 series, accusing the tech giant of allegedly engaging in misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms. Apple in October last year announced that the iPhone 12 would not come with chargers or earbuds in their boxes, citing environmental concerns. Apple introduced the iPhone 12 series in October and announced that the phone would only have a charging cable inside the box, without a power adapter and headphones.

## COVID-19: Science behind Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be used to give people cancer jabs 'within a couple of years', says co-creator - The technology used to develop the Pfizer jab can be applied to get the immune system to take on tumours

> The co-creator of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine has said the technology behind it could soon be used to fight cancer too. While the vaccine has been bankrolled by the American pharmaceutical giant, the science itself is the work of BioNTech, a German company founded by married couple and dedicated physicians Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci. Asked when such a therapy might be available, she replied: "That's very difficult to predict in innovative development. But we expect that within only a couple of years, we will also have our vaccines cancer at a place where we can offer them to people."

## Biden calls Turkey’s exit from treaty for women unwarranted

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-turkey-europe-istanbul-europe-4868098d09c3acb58eb9b74de75e5ecd):

> ISTANBUL - U.S. President Joe Biden has called Turkey's abandonment of an international agreement aimed at preventing violence against women "Deeply disappointing." "The Istanbul Convention, originally intended to promote women's rights, was hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalize homosexuality - which is incompatible with Turkey's social and family values. Hence, the decision to withdraw," the statement said. The Istanbul Convention states that men and women have equal rights and obliges national authorities to take steps to prevent gender-based violence against women, to protect victims and to prosecute perpetrators.

> What is the rationalization for leaving the pact? Russia also rolled back legislation protecting women from domestic abuse and Poland has talked about doing the same. But what is the rationale? I am genuinely interested because it seems regressive at best and sociopathic at worst.

## Turkey’s Lira Plunges 17% following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s shock decision to replace the country’s central-bank chief

Summary of [original article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/turkey-bulls-are-wrong-footed-after-central-bank-hawk-s-ouster):

> The Turkish lira plunged as much as 15% against the dollar following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's shock decision to replace the country's central bank chief. "I expect massive state bank intervention in the short term to hold a line on the lira," said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London, adding that he's not yet sure where the line will be drawn. Authorities may impose capital controls to stabilize markets, according to Per Hammarlund, chief emerging-market strategist at SEB AB. Swings of 15% in either direction are expected as foreign investors flee, the central bank intervenes and bargain hunters come in, he said.

## In precedent, court rules school can bar unvaccinated, untested worker

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-precedent-court-rules-school-can-bar-unvaccinated-untested-worker/):

> In a landmark ruling, a Tel Aviv labor court ruled Sunday that a school can prevent unvaccinated employees who refuse to have regular COVID-19 tests from coming to work, determining that the children's safety takes precedence over staff's rights. The ruling came in the case of a teaching assistant at a school in the town of Tzur Yigal in central Israel, who appealed against the local council's decision to demand that all education staff members either get vaccinated or take regular coronavirus tests as a condition for coming to work. Kleiman said her decision stemmed from "The existing information on the vaccine's efficiency in preventing infections, and after weighing the obvious and immediate harm that could be done to the students - kids with special needs who cannot adhere to distancing rules - and many third parties including parents and school employees, if they get infected."

> Do the same with students

> Edit: clarification, I meant with Covid vaccs, but yeah while I'm here, make sure your crotch monkeys have all their vaccines.
