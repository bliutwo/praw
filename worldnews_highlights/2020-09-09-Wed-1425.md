> Definitely true with regards to environmental impact statements for government projects. Our laws are really shit, the government can disregard the recommendations of the ecologists employed to do the impact assessment and the ecologist must sign a non-disclosure agreement. So basically no matter what you find the project will go ahead and the public won't even know what was destroyed.

> We wish we had euthinasia as the suffering and pain is immense. We opted for home care (their choice) and it was the most exhausting thing I've done in my life (and I've worked 70 hour weeks in busy kitchens) I can only imagine how they truly felt.
> 
> This is a very stubborn thing (though completely understandable) to do, continuing the unwanted suffering of others for your own personal benefit is not in the interests of those suffering. (Both physical and mental)
> 
> It hurts but it's for the best. I honestly wouldn't wish my enemies to go through what I went through. That is, our health service (god love them though) to preserve life at all costs. Palliative care can only do so much.
> 
> Be nice guys, This is my opinion and the subject is still very raw. (Not even sure why I'm saying this to be honest, but it's out there now.)

## Earth may temporarily pass dangerous 1.5℃ warming limit by 2024, major new report says | This first overshoot beyond 1.5℃ would be temporary, likely aided by a major climate anomaly such as an El Niño. However, it casts new doubt on whether Earth's climate can be permanently stabilized at 1.5℃

## ‘Doomsday glacier’ in Antarctica melting due to warm water channels under surface, scientists discover

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-glacier-melting-antarctica-thwaites-doomsday-warm-water-b421022.html):

> Scientists studying a giant mass of ice in Antarctica known as the "Doomsday glacier" believe they have discovered why it is melting so rapidly and pushing up sea levels. A team of UK and US researchers have found a series of deep channels beneath Thwaites Glacier thought to be acting as pathways for warm ocean water to melt the underside of the ice. A series of missions by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration - using ship and aircraft - mapped the sea channels underneath the glacier in detail for the first time, and found they were far deeper than previously thought.

## WeChat and TikTok taking China censorship global, study says - The most popular Chinese-owned social media from WeChat to TikTok are increasingly censoring content in the U.S. and elsewhere, taking practices honed for years behind the Great Firewall to an international audience.

Summary of [original article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/09/09/world/wechat-tiktok-china-censorship/):

> The most popular Chinese-owned social media from WeChat to TikTok are increasingly censoring content in the U.S. and elsewhere, taking practices honed for years behind the Great Firewall to an international audience. WeChat has long complied with controls back home, while TikTok - which operates only outside China - has pushed back against claims it's influenced by that country's government. "As we've said before, TikTok user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, with strict controls on employee access," a TikTok spokesperson said.

## Ex-VW CEO to face charges of organized commercial fraud

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions/ex-vw-ceo-to-face-charges-of-organized-commercial-fraud-idUSKBN26024J?il=0):

> FRANKFURT - Former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn will face charges of conspiracy to commit organized commercial fraud with a high likelihood of conviction, a court probing the carmaker's diesel emissions scandal said on Wednesday. A court in Braunschweig, Germany, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, expanded the list of charges beyond fraud to include organized commercial fraud, preliminary remarks published by the court at the start of the trial showed. Winterkorn and other Volkswagen executives face charges for their role in allowing diesel cars with illegal emissions-masking software to hit the road. Because Volkswagen vehicles had higher pollution levels than was declared, they should have been subject to higher road tax, and former Volkswagen executives should therefore also face charges of tax evasion and false advertising, the court added.

`/u/stoptheinsultsuhack` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ipg97u/exvw_ceo_to_face_charges_of_organized_commercial/):

> >The scandal, which was uncovered by U.S. authorities in September 2015, has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in refits, legal fees and settlements, and resulted in a drastic management and strategy overhaul.
> 
> so I guess just faking emission results and gaming the system was a bad move then? I wonder how many other huge companies, if you took a good look, are doing something similar/shady to boost their profits?
