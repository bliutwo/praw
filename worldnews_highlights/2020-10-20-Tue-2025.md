## Lawyers: We can't find parents of 545 kids separated by Trump admin

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/lawyers-say-they-can-t-find-parents-545-migrant-children-n1244066):

> WASHINGTON - Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children, and that approximately two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing from the ACLU on Tuesday. The Trump administration instituted a "Zero tolerance" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern U.S. border. Unlike the 2,800 families separated under zero tolerance in 2018, most of whom remained in custody when zero tolerance was ended by executive order, many of the more than 1,000 parents separated from their children under the pilot program had already been deported before a federal judge in California ordered they be found.

## US spies and diplomats are suggesting a Trump administration cover-up after officials in Cuba, Russia, and China got mysteriously sick

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-spies-diplomats-mysteriously-sick-suggest-coverup-2020-10):

> US spies and diplomats are accusing the Trump administration of refusing to properly investigate mysterious illnesses that have affected officials in Cuba, China, and Russia, and some are suggesting a cover-up, The New York Times reported on Monday. Six US officials told The Times that the department realized it could not take the same route with the Chinese cases as it did with the Cuban cases without crippling the US's diplomatic and economic relationships with China. Two US officials told The Times that CIA Director Gina Haspel knew that Russia had a motive to harm US operatives but was not convinced that attacks had taken place or that Russia could be responsible.

## Chocolate industry slammed for failure to crack down on child labour

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/20/chocolate-industry-slammed-for-failure-to-crack-down-on-child-labour):

> Nearly 20 years after the world's major chocolate manufacturers pledged to abolish employment abuses, hazardous child labour remains rife in their supply chains, a new study finds. In response to the scathing report, US chocolate giant Mars reiterated that child labour has no place in cocoa production and said it had committed $1bn to help "Fix a broken supply chain". "In the past 20 years, the cocoa industry has invested enormous skill and resources in public relations around sustainability, but the increase in child labour demonstrates it has utterly failed to bring that same expertise and investment to create real sustainability."

`/u/zeekoes` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jepbkk/chocolate_industry_slammed_for_failure_to_crack/):

> I know that the dude who started Tony Chocolony was disillusioned by the fact how impossible it was to produce Child labor and slave labor free chocolate. The supply chain of ingredients is so corrupt that it's impossible to verify whether all contracts are honored by all subcontractors involved. An internal investigation showed that even though contractors were obliged to provide ethically sourced cocoa, they imported cocoa from the 'black market' regardless and mixed it in the delivery via false certificates or a paper trail that's impossible to verify before the chocolate hits the market.
> 
> That's why the company felt obliged to remove the "100% slave free" from their packaging and change it to a commitment to strive for as ethically sourced as possible. Something the founder couldn't stand behind and quit.
> 
> Which is really dark when you think about it. Making chocolate with the best intentions possible still makes you complicit in the slave trade regardless.

## #EndSARS : Nigerian Soldiers shoot into crowd of Youths protesting against Police Brutality in Nigeria's capital

Summary of [original article](https://punchng.com/soldiers-disperse-endsars-protesters-in-kubwa-abuja/):

> Armed soldiers have reportedly dispersed some protesting youths at Sokale, Dutse Alhaji and the FO1 area of Kubwa on Tuesday morning. The troops were said to have shot into the air to disperse the #EndSARS protesters who had gathered to begin the day's protest. The protesters had erected a barricade at the Sokale roundabout and Winners road in preparation for the rally when the security operatives aborted their protest.

> For everyone trying to dismiss OP's post, I suggest you go on Nigerian twitter and see what people on ground have to say about this developing situation including the NSFW videos of protesters dying and being shot to confirm for yourself. 99% of Nigerian media houses are compromised (and even more so since the protests started) and you will not get any accurate info from them.  
> I'm a mod on r/Nigeria and you can see the numerous posts about today's catastrophe in our community. So yes, the government actually sent the military to shoot at peaceful protesters.

## NATO would seek early summit with Biden, if elected, envoys say

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-nato/nato-would-seek-early-summit-with-biden-if-elected-envoys-say-idUSKBN27514U):

> 3 Min Read.BRUSSELS - The NATO military alliance is considering a summit in March in Brussels to welcome a new U.S. president if Democrat candidate Joe Biden wins, diplomats and officials said, with a gathering in the first half of next year if Donald Trump is reelected. A March summit "Would give Biden a platform to bring Europe and North America back together and also give NATO a chance to put the Trump era behind it," a second diplomat said. They and the two diplomats also said that if Trump were reelected, NATO would seek to hold a summit in early summer, but that there was less urgency because he had already attended NATO summits and his position was seen as likely to harden.
