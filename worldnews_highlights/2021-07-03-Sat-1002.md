## Conservative group says Germany could become the world’s first industrialised country running on 100% renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens’ expenses on transport, heating and power use

Summary of [original article](https://reneweconomy.com.au/conservative-group-says-germany-could-reach-100-renewables-by-2030-at-low-cost/):

> The conservative climate group KlimaUnion, which is made up of party members of the governing / alliance, has a position paper in which the members argue that Germany could become the world's first industrialised country running on 100-percent renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens' expenses on transport, heating and power use. In the paper, KlimaUnion argues that Germany could save up to 63 billion euros in energy imports per year if it manages to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, which could be turned into a "Growth booster" in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Group member Wiebke Winter said the position paper should be seen as an "Argumentation aid" for the conservative / alliance's election manifesto that offers "Concrete proposals" on starting to make Germany climate neutral already during the next legislative period until 2025.

## Vietnam orders Netflix to remove Australian spy show over South China Sea map

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-orders-netflix-remove-australian-spy-show-over-south-china-sea-map-2021-07-02/):

> HANOI, July 2 - Netflix Inc has removed Australian spy drama "Pine Gap" from its services in Vietnam after a complaint from broadcast authorities in the Southeast Asian country about the appearance of a map which depicts Chinese claims in the South China Sea.The map, which briefly features on the screens of a control room at a spy base in two episodes of the six-part show, depicts China's unilaterally declared "Nine-dash line" and is displayed within the context of maritime claims in the region. "This is the third time in a row in the last 12 months that Netflix has been found to distribute movies and TV shows containing content which violate Vietnam's sovereignty," said the statement, which was dated July 1.The "Nine-dash line" is a U-shaped feature used on Chinese maps to illustrate its disputed claims over vast expanses of the resource-rich South China Sea, including large swathes of what Vietnam regards as its continental shelf, where it has awarded oil concessions. In October 2019, Vietnam pulled DreamWorks' animated film "Abominable" from cinemas over a scene featuring a similar map showing the "Nine-dash line".

> What we'd like is a fair-use clip from the movie showing the map, not a stock image of Netflix's office.
