## Australian reporter Jonathan Swan corners Donald Trump on pandemic

Summary of [original article](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12353763):

> It was the case today, when HBO aired Trump's much-anticipated interview with Axios's national political correspondent, Australian reporter Jonathan Swan. Swan started the interview by questioning whether Trump's positive attitude regarding the coronavirus - in other words, his repeated insistence over a period of months that it was under control and would disappear - was suited to dealing seriously with the pandemic. Swan tried to move on to another subject, but Trump felt he had more of value to say.

> Great interview, I wish all reporters were that much on the ball! Especially this bit:
> 
> > Trump: "Here's one. Well, right here, United States is lowest in numerous categories. We're lower than the world."
> 
> > Swan: "Oh, you're doing death as a proportion of cases. I'm talking about death as a proportion of population. That's where the US is really bad. Much worse than Germany, South Korea, et cetera."
> 
> > Trump: "You can't – you can't do that."
> 
> > Swan: "Why can't I do that?"
> 
> > Trump: "You have to go by, you have to go by – look. Here is the United States – you have to go by the cases. The cases of death."
> 
> > Swan: "Why not as a proportion of population?"
> 
> Exactly right. I guess he won't be allowed to interview again.

> I had to google it because honestly we learn nothing about Puerto Rico in school. Population around 3.4 million people, more than roughly 20 states (notably Hawaii) and the District of Columbia, and we treat it like a rock with 7 people on it off in the middle of nowhere nowhere

## An Indian priest dies of Covid-19 after making thousands of his followers eat food coated with his saliva

Summary of [original article](https://www.arre.co.in/coronavirus/priest-gujarat-godman-covid-19-prasad-with-saliva/):

> Last month, a priest in Gujarat's Ahmedabad died due to Covid-19. A Hindu priest in Ahmedabad has died of COVID. Here's the kicker though, remember the fake news circulated by brahmin media abt "Spitting on food" to villify muslims? This pandit was actually feeding devotees his saliva laced sweets as 'prasad', single handedly infecting 1000s. This godman from Gujarat, Purushottam Priyadas, who distributed prasad laced with his saliva, has died of Covid.

> I worked there briefly and I can tell you the major problem is that so many people aspire to work at Blizzard and will do anything and put up with anything to be a part of their games that Blizzard really has no reason to pay people better.

## Physicists: 90% Chance of Human Society Collapsing Within Decades | "Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10 percent in most optimistic estimate, to survive," the authors write

Summary of [original article](https://www.ecowatch.com/human-society-collapse-deforestation-2646869167.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2):

> <p>We are careful to emphasize how rare shark bites are: You are 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning than be bitten by a shark. Almost all shark bites that occur off Cape Cod are by white sharks, which are a large, primarily cold-water species that spend most of their time in isolation feeding on fishes. If sharks actively hunted people, there would be many more bites, since humans make very easy targets when they swim in sharks' natural habitats.

`/u/Existential-Funk` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i3bsft/physicists_90_chance_of_human_society_collapsing/):

> Just so people know, this was done based off a model, which assumes deforestation/population rates are constant. In other words, they are making predictions based off the assumption that humans  do nothing about it and take no action (even though these responses are ongoing)
> 
> Most importantly, they use deforestation as a surrogate measure for all Human Resources. There is many other methods to obtain resources, and therefor this model cannot generalize to the world we live in. Additionally, when demand exceeds resources, of course the growth curve plateaus, or decreases. But to make a stretch by saying ‘total extinction’ isn’t right - it certainly functions to grasp ones attention and gain views.
> 
> For those still reading, This is simply a sensationalist article. Although global/human health are important topics that need ongoing action, there is many other resources to learn this information from.
