## Antibiotics banned in UK but fed to US animals ‘may undermine drugs for cancer, Covid and infections’: Ban on hormone beef and chlorinated chicken in UK-US trade deal would not be enough to protect consumers, report warns.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/us-brexit-trade-deal-antibiotics-meat-drug-b1780438.html):

> US-reared animals whose meat is set to be imported under post-Brexit trade deals are fed 10 antibiotics banned in the UK, potentially undermining treatments for infections, cancer and even coronavirus, a report has warned. In a letter to environment secretary George Eustice, Mr Young wrote: "Given the growing worldwide problem of antimicrobial resistance, it would be completely irresponsible if the government were to allow the importation of beef, pork or poultry meat produced with the use of antibiotics for growth promotion which have been banned here, or the use of antibiotics that are licensed in the UK but used in the US for disease suppression in ways that would be illegal here." He added: "A free trade deal with the US could make the UK a potential market for US poultry meat, since our main sources of imports are currently non-EU anyway. And once we have a free-trade deal with the US, the US and EU will be competing on an equal footing, except for production standards, where those in the US are much lower."

## Jair Bolsonaro has been named the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project’s 2020 Person of the Year for his role in promoting organized crime and corruption

Summary of [original article](https://www.occrp.org/en/poy/2020/):

> DONATE. Jair Bolsonaro, President of Brazil, has been named the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project's 2020 Person of the Year for his role in promoting organized crime and corruption. Elected in the wake of the Lava Jato scandal as an anti-corruption candidate, Bolsonaro has instead surrounded himself with corrupt figures, used propaganda to promote his populist agenda, undermined the justice system, and waged a destructive war against the Amazon region that has enriched some of the country's worst land owners. Bolsonaro narrowly beat two other populist leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, for the dubious prize.

## Whales alive: beaked species spotted for first time by Chinese scientists. Three whales seen in South China Sea were Deraniyagala’s beaked whales or ginkgo-toothed beaked whales. The least-known marine mammals, these species have previously been spotted only dead and stranded.

Summary of [original article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3115880/whales-alive-beaked-species-spotted-first-time-chinese):

> Have reported the world's first sightings alive of a little-known species of whale while working in the South China Sea.A deep-sea team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences spotted three beaked whales during an offshore research trip last year, the CAS has revealed. The team from the Institute of Deep?Sea Science and Engineering initially identified them as either Deraniyagala's beaked whales or ginkgo-toothed beaked whales. Beaked whales of either kind have never been spotted alive before.

`/u/Jiapanda` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kne692/whales_alive_beaked_species_spotted_for_first/):

> Really cool that these are the first ones of their kind seen alive. They kinda look like a weird mix of whale and dolphin with their beaked snout.
> 
> Also, as of writing this, nearly every single top level comment is a “joke” about them eating them or using them for medicine. Y’all really need new material.
