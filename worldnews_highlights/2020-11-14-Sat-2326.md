## Water cannon fired at German anti-lockdown rally

Summary of [original article](https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKKBN27U0KS):

> 3 Min Read.MUNICH/FRANKFURT - German police fired water cannon during an anti-lockdown rally in Frankfurt on Saturday and eventually broke up the gathering as rules like wearing masks and socially distancing were not observed. Health Minister Jens Spahn said at an online event of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party that hard weeks, possibly even months, lie ahead."It takes a very long time even with very severe measures", Spahn said, pointing to the Southern German Berchtesgaden district, which has been in a full lock-down since Oct. 20.Bavaria's conservative Prime Minister Markus Soeder said that he does not expect any lockdown rules to be eased before the end of November. Baden-Wuerttemberg's Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann told daily Augsburger Allgemeine that relaxing lockdown measures at Christmas would be possible only if the rate of new infections decreases in a significant way.

`/u/foodbag` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ju6tqs/water_cannon_fired_at_german_antilockdown_rally/):

> This headline is a bit misleading. The police did not use the Water cannon against the "Querdenker" aka anti-lockdown rally at the beginning. They used them against the couinter protesters to clear the way for the anti-lockdown rally. Only later in the day after the anti-lockdown rally was ended by the police and the protesters not complying was the water cannon also used against the Querdenker.
> 
> 
> 
> The article does not mention the second part and only speaks of the usage of the water cannon against the counter protesters.
