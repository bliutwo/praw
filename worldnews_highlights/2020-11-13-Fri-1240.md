Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8943969/Candles-condemnation-thousands-mourn-death-Belarus-protester.html):

> Thousands of people carrying candles and flowers gathered in Minsk on Thursday to mourn the death of a 31-year-old anti-government protester who they say was badly beaten by Belarusian security forces and died in hospital. The death is the latest flashpoint in months of mass protests against Lukashenko following a disputed presidential election in August. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood against Lukashenko in the election and then fled into exile, called Bondarenko a hero of Belarus.

> It's a start, that's for sure. The end-goal is 2 billion doses by the end of 2021; Pfizer said recently their nominal price/dose (although in the US paid for by the gov't) is about $39.
> 
> If a discount for the developing world is about 60% (say about $15) that's still $30B needed, thus 'a long way to go'.

## Britain's Boris Johnson refers to Trump as America's 'previous president'

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/11/12/boris-johnson-donald-trump-previous-president/6262094002/):

> As President Donald Trump digs his heels in and refuses to concede to President-elect Joe Biden over the U.S. election, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already moved on. Ever since Biden became president-elect over the weekend, Johnson has repeatedly said in public he looks forward to working with Biden on "Strengthening the partnership between our countries and to working with him on our shared priorities." Johnson has characterized these priorities as combatting climate change and supporting the NATO military alliance, two topics that Trump has clashed with European leaders over in recent years. Partly because of some alleged lingering bad blood between Johnson and former President Barack Obama, who Johnson previously accused in a newspaper article of removing a bust of his hero Winston Churchill from the White House's Oval Office because of his "Part-Kenyan ancestry" and "Ancestral dislike of the British empire."

## Report: Neste responsible for rainforest destruction ‘the size of Paris’ since 2019

Summary of [original article](https://newsnowfinland.fi/finland-international/report-neste-responsible-for-rainforest-destruction-the-size-of-paris-since-2019):

> A new report claims that Finland's majority state-owned fuel company Neste is responsible for the destruction of at least 10,000 hectares of rainforest since 2019 - an area the size of Paris. Meanwhile another 2019 report from a tech company that monitors natural resources found that there was widespread orangutan habitat destruction around mills in Indonesia where Neste sources some of its products; and an earlier investigation in January 2019 highlighted how Neste was still buying palm oil from mills caught in illegal rainforest harvest operations. Investigation: Neste still buying palm oil from mills caught in illegal rainforest harvests.

> E: I urge people to read all the responses to my question with skepticism, and also maybe have a look at the history of users commenting. There's a lot of whataboutism in the responses. I'm not anti or pro china, just trying to figure this out like everyone else. Alas reddit wasnt the best place to ask this question, I shouldve known TT

## Possible hostage situation at Ubisoft company in Montreal

Summary of [original article](https://www.journaldequebec.com/2020/11/13/possible-prise-dotages-chez-ubisoft-a-montreal):

> Des dizaines de personnes seraient possiblement tenues en otage dans un bâtiment abritant les locaux de la compagnie Ubisoft, sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent,  Montréal. C'est ce qu'a appris l'Agence QMI. La police n'était pas en mesure de confirmer l'information, en début d'après-midi, se limitant  dire que des «vérifications sont en cours». On peut voir des dizaines de personnes sur le toit de l'immeuble grâce aux images de l'hélicoptère de TVA Nouvelles.

`/u/Thisnickname` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jtlyff/possible_hostage_situation_at_ubisoft_company_in/):

> As of now there are no known causes. An armed robbery was reported **near** the building according to SPVM officials. 
> 
> Other floors in the building are on lockdown. Police says to stay inside and away from doors and windows. Some employees have been evacuated. 
> 
> EDIT : 
> 
> * 14:49EST - I will update this comment as information flows in.
> * 14:53 - Police asks media to give as little detail as possible until negotiators get in contact with the perpetrators because they could be watching and could hear compromising information regarding police operation or hostages.
> * 15:01 - SWAT team leaders seen entering the building. Unclear as of now if they are entering to secure lower floors or to negotiate with the perpetrator(s).
> * 15:04 - Employees on lower floors interviewed on the phone say they feel secure, but stressed as they are told to stay inside. They haven't heard any commotion from the Ubisoft floors above.
> * 15:07 - More and more swat teams members are entering the building according to media on ground. Unclear if they are clearing floors. No one is coming out as of yet, only entering.
> * 15:09 - SPVM just tweeted they are responding to a 911 call in the Ubisoft building as was already known and that there are currently no injuries or casualties to report. [Tweet](https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSPVM%2Fstatus%2F1327342860404973568&widget=Tweet)
> * 15:15 - SWAT team members seen entering the building are calm and "slow". According to police experts on the news this means at least part of the building is secured and SWAT are taking point inside the building for a possible call to action.
> * 15:25 - Ubisoft employee that is on the roof just spoke on the news. Says they were isolated on the roof by a high ranking Ubisoft employee as a preventive measure. They are calm but concerned. No commotion. They are a bit cold but trying to keep the spirits up.
> * 15:26 - A user below commented this was a fake hostage situation. This information hasn't been confirmed and he hasn't provided a source yet. I will update if this turns out to be confirmed.
> * 15:31 - Some news sources (TVA) are floating the idea that this might have been a "prank"/false alarm. The phone call that got this all started might have been fake. Nothing confirmed as of now.
> * 15:33 - Jason Schreier a video game reporter says Ubisoft are aware of a situation but reminds us that nothing is confirmed as of now. It's important to wait on a confirmation before stating that it is or not a real hostage situation. We are still in the verification phase.  [Tweet] (https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1327345711202131968?s=20)
> * 15:39 - /u/tinyfred who works at Ubisoft says "I work for Ubisoft and received an email saying police have apparently reached each floor and are clearing people out.
> It seems like it was a fake swatting call after all." If this is true, the media will probably confirm it soon enough and I will update my post. It seems information is pointing more and more towards a fake swatting.
