> This is probably a good point to say that sentient means capable of feeling sensations or emotions. Being capable of higher cognition is being sapient. The edge case definitions of these terms are vague, but recognizing something as sentient is wildly different from recognizing something as sapient.

## Dead whale found with 16kg of plastic bags, wrappers inside stomach: The cetacean, a female Cuvier's beaked whale measuring a little over 5 meters in length, washed up on a beach in Messanges in south-west France, which is on the Atlantic coast.

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/dead-whale-found-16kg-plastic-bags-wrappers-inside-stomach-1590310):

> Environmental conservationists have expressed their "Anger" after 16kg of plastic waste was found inside the stomach of a beached whale. Cetaceans tend to ingest plastics and other waste through bio-accumulation, where they unwittingly consume prey that has itself ingested plastic. Though the whale may have died as a result of its illness alone, the experts believe that its consumption of the plastic significantly accelerated its death.
