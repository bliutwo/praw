## New Zealand PM Ardern's ratings sky high ahead of election

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-election-ardern/new-zealand-pm-arderns-ratings-sky-high-ahead-of-election-idUSKCN24R0UI):

> WELLINGTON - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party raced ahead of rivals in the latest opinion poll, putting the charismatic 40-year-old leader on track for a comfortable victory in the elections in September. The popularity of the main opposition National Party, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and leadership changes, plunged to 25.1%. According to the survey the Labour Party, which is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, would win 77 of 120 seats in parliament. Ardern's own popularity as preferred prime minister was sky high at 62%, while the National Party's newly elected 61-year-old leader Judith Collins stood at just 14.6%. Ardern has consistently polled ahead of her rivals and her popularity has risen further this year as she won global praise for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Philippine Duterte: Face-to-face classes to resume in January 2021. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers

Summary of [original article](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/27/20/duterte-no-face-to-face-classes-until-covid-19-vaccine-is-available):

> MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday said in-person classes would be allowed starting January 21, clarifying earlier statements he made, as the COVID-19 threat remains. Last week, the president approved the Department of Education's proposal to hold limited in-person or face-to-face classes in areas with low risk of COVID-19 transmission. Classes in public schools are scheduled to start on August 24 while private schools are allowed to open earlier upon the approval of the DepEd's regional directors.

> It’s come to this, America—a nut job like Duterte is a more competent leader than our own president.
> 
> EDIT: just to clarify, I said *more competent*. If Trump is 2% competent and Duterte is 3% competent, then Duterte is *more competent*. Doesn’t mean that either one is fit to lick the mildew from a truck-stop toilet bowl, much less govern a nation.
