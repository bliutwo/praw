> In the group, he calls himself Connectis, but outside his newfound digital identity, he is understood to be the managing director of a real estate firm near the capital Berlin. Messages within the group have been shared by some of Germany's most prominent conspiracy theory and far-right influencers, such as well-known former news presenter Eva Herman, whose network reaches more than 170,000 users. According to the QPatrioten24 chat, group members were also present at the attempted breach of the Reichstag building in Berlin last year.

> I don't understand how the Q cult is still around. Not a single one of the nutjob Nostradamus predictions or declarations have been factual in any way.

## Boris Johnson refuses to back Trump and Biden teams in calling Uighur situation ‘genocide’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-uighur-muslims-genocide-trump-biden-b1789997.html):

> Boris Johnson has refused to describe the treatment of China's Muslim Uighur minority as "Genocide", despite use of the term by both the Trump and Biden administrations. Challenged to take the same step in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Johnson insisted that, while he regarded the treatment of the Uighurs as "Utterly abhorrent", determining whether it amounted to genocide was a matter for judges, not politicians. Mr Blackford called on the PM to follow the lead of Pompeo and Blinken, and "Stand up today and clearly state that genocide is being committed against the Uighur population in China".

## First Black firefighter says he endured 'torture' and heard the N-word "every single day" for years in Calgary (Canada)

Summary of [original article](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/trauma-at-the-station):

> The members interviewed for this story estimate that less than three per cent of the 1,400 firefighters are BIPOC. 'The most trauma I've experienced is in the fire halls'. Retired firefighter Shannon Pennington, who also heads a firefighter veterans' network, and Doreen Spence, a Cree elder, both made presentations about racism at CFD. Pennington, who has First Nations roots, fields many late-night phone calls from distressed firefighters and has become an unofficial peer counsellor for those in crisis. "PTSD can come from calls, but the most trauma I've experienced is in the fire halls," said a current firefighter.

`/u/that_yeg_guy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/l11596/first_black_firefighter_says_he_endured_torture/):

> I work with firefighters regularly, and I’m a gay man. The “bro” culture is extraordinary strong and toxic in firehalls. If you’re not straight, often white, and stereotypically masculine, you are ridiculed and mistreated. It’s not every firehouse and every firefighter, but it’s many, and a major problem. It’s specifically why I chose not to become a firefighter. 
> 
> There’s a reason firefighting has comparatively low numbers of women, people of colour, and sexual minorities as members. 
> 
> I’m not surprised at this man’s story. They carefully promote and protect the “hero” and “selfless”stereotype, but the firefighting industry needs a major culture change.
