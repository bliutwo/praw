## Australians may face longer lockdown after "reckless" mass protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australians-may-face-longer-lockdown-after-mass-protests-2021-07-24/):

> Under fire for a slow vaccine rollout, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more vaccine supply was not going to ensure New South Wales gets out of lockdown, but what was needed was an effective, properly enforced lockdown. Numbers of such cases have stayed stubbornly high even after four weeks of lockdown in Sydney, now expected to be extended beyond July 30.The state reported two deaths overnight, including a woman in her 30s with no pre-existing conditions. Australia's Victoria state reported 11 locally acquired COVID-19 cases on Sunday, down from 12 a day earlier, raising hopes the state will end a hard lockdown imposed 10 days ago.

> The outbreak and the protest only happened because the right wing Liberal and National parties\* and their Murdoch media buddies are:
> 
> * Pushing anti-vaxx stuff and anti-lockdown craziness (this is morso Murdoch and a few extra-crazy politicians on the right)
> * Failed to lock down soon enough in here in New South Wales, despite having tons of warning and previous examples from other states
> * Failed to set up a national quarantine system in time
> * Failed to rollout vaccines (we are like 13% fully vaccinated rn)
> * Failed to financially look after many of those affected by lockdowns.
> 
> \*Who run both the federal government, and the state government of New South Wales where the outbreak is mainly happening.

## Large study finds COVID-19 is linked to a substantial drop in intelligence

Summary of [original article](https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/large-study-finds-covid-19-is-linked-to-a-substantial-drop-in-intelligence-61577):

> People who have recovered from COVID-19 tend to score significantly lower on an intelligence test compared to those who have not contracted the virus, according to new research published in The Lancet journal EClinicalMedicine. After controlling for factors such as age, sex, handedness, first language, education level, and other variables, the researchers found that those who had contracted COVID-19 tended to underperform on the intelligence test compared to those who had not contracted the virus. Although a small subset of 275 participants completed the intelligence test both before and after contracting COVID-19, the study mostly employed a cross-sectional methodology, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions about cause and effect.

## Putin says Russian navy can carry out 'unpreventable strike' if needed

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-russian-navy-can-carry-out-unpreventable-strike-if-needed-2021-07-25/):

> MOSCOW, July 25 - The Russian navy can detect any enemy and launch an "Unpreventable strike" if needed, President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, weeks after a UK warship angered Moscow by passing the Crimea peninsula. "We are capable of detecting any underwater, above-water, airborne enemy and, if required, carry out an unpreventable strike against it," Putin said speaking at a navy day parade in St Petersburg. Putin's words follow an incident in the Black Sea in June when Russia said it had fired warning shots and dropped bombs in the path of a British warship to chase it out of Crimea waters.

`/u/Zihamer` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/or9mlc/putin_says_russian_navy_can_carry_out/):

> All nations with nuclear weapons can carry out horrendous unpreventable damage if they chose to do so.
