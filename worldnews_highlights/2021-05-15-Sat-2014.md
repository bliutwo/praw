> “If Gaza just got rid of Hamas, we would leave them alone. We are fighting Hamas, not the Palestinians” Is the common Israeli talking point.
> 
> Okay. The West Bank is governed by the PLO and literally nothing to do with Hamas. They don’t even like Hamas. The PLO cooperates with Israel, and declared Israel has a right to exist decades ago (1993). It is not even physically connected to the Gaza Strip. How are they treated?

> -	The West Bank has no Hamas. And they are STILL being kicked out of their own homes every single year. And then watching the people who stole their homes getting free 24/7 military security detail.

> -	The West Bank has no Hamas. They still have 500+ checkpoints on their OWN LAND that ONLY applies to Palestinians, not the settlers.

You all know what that means. Yep. Less funding. Less teachers. Less opportunity. This HRW report is from the 2000s, but there has been little progress since this report. The only difference is that some mixed Charter schools have opened. Wow. So progressive.

> It’s not about Hamas. It’s about removing the Palestinians. And making sure the ones that are left are “kept in their place” as second class citizens. Israel is an apartheid state.
