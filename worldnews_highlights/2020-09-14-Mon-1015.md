## Germany says French, Swedish labs confirm Navalny's Novichok poisoning

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26511I):

> 2 Min Read.BERLIN - Laboratories in Sweden and France have independently confirmed that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the Soviet-style nerve agent Novichok, the German government said on Monday. Army doctors at Berlin's Charite hospital, to which Navalny was evacuated after taking ill on a flight over Siberia last month, were the first to say he had been poisoned with Novichok. The poisoning has brought tensions between Russia and Germany to new heights, fuelling calls for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Kremlin flagship project to bring Russian gas direct to Germany under the Baltic Sea, to be scrapped.
