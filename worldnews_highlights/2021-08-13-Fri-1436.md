## China’s zero-Covid policy is so strict that it shut down a whole shipping terminal after just one case

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/chinas-zero-covid-strategy-to-disrupt-shipping-as-ningbo-zhoushan-port-shuts-.html):

> China has shut down a key terminal at its Ningbo-Zhoushan port, the third busiest port in the world, after one worker was found to be infected by Covid - a move that will likely put further pressure on already stretched supply networks. "China has a zero tolerance for COVID. One person testing positive is enough to shut down port," she told CNBC in an email. In June, Covid infections triggered disruptions at shipping hubs in Southern China, including the key Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports - the first time that China suspended operations at ports due to Covid cases.

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/afghanistan-taliban-us-troops-08-12-21/h_06e37dbfe7a8fa41303b028b153ba6c0):

> The US Embassy in Kabul again urged American citizens to leave Afghanistan "Immediately" amid rapid Taliban gains in the country. "The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to leave Afghanistan immediately using available commercial flight options," the embassy said Thursday, noting that Americans who cannot afford to purchase airline tickets should contact the embassy "For information regarding a repatriation loan."The embassy issued its alert as the Taliban continued its assault, seizing major cities and capitols, dealing blow after blow to the Afghan government, its army and the US and its allies who trained Afghan forces. The Taliban wave comes just weeks before US troops are scheduled to complete their withdrawal, with US intelligence agencies forecasting that within months, if not weeks, Kabul could be isolated, and perhaps fall, raising questions about the security of the US embassy and other foreign missions in Kabul.

## Tax on billionaires’ Covid windfall could vaccinate every adult on Earth - 99% levy on pandemic wealth rise could also pay all unemployed $20,000 – and still leave super-rich $55bn richer

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/12/tax-billionaires-covid-windfall-vaccinate-every-adult-on-earth):

> Every adult in the world could get a Covid-19 vaccine if the wealth billionaires collected during the pandemic was taxed 99% once, according to an analysis published on Thursday by several groups which advocate for economic equity. This one-time tax on the world's 2,690 billionaires could also cover $20,000 in cash to all unemployed workers, according to the analysis by Oxfam, the Fight Inequality Alliance, the Institute for Policy Studies and the Patriotic Millionaires. During the first world war, the US increased its tax rate for people with the highest incomes to 67%. In the second world war, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to cap individual income at $25,000.

`/u/dhurane` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/p3iu51/tax_on_billionaires_covid_windfall_could/):

> So how would the tax actually work? The wealth rise is mainly in stock valuation, so they either have to forfeit the shares to the government (and the government sells them for cash?) or they need to sell them on the market which begs the question if there's enough buyers during such a firesale and if it'll actually bring in the expected revenue.

> It's also interesting to see WHEN the governments sets the tax rate, as the market value usually fluctuates.

> The so called "Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan" was simply an agreement that the US would withdraw without there being any meaningful conditions for the Taliban. Trump was desperate for something that he could sell as a "peace deal". So the US made sure the name would suggest that. Nothing else mattered.
