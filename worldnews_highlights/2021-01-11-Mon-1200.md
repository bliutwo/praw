## U.S. Capitol siege a 'wake-up call' for democracies, top EU diplomat says

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSKBN29F0G9):

> 3 Min Read.BRUSSELS - The European Union's top diplomat said on Sunday that last week's siege of the U.S. Capitol exposed the dangers of allowing the degradation of democratic values to go unchecked and disinformation to spread on social media. Trump has repeatedly used Twitter and other platforms to claim the election result was fraudulent and to share other conspiracy theories. These would force large online platforms to tackle illegal content and intentional manipulation of platforms to influence elections and public health, or face fines up to 6% of global turnover.

`/u/nyl2k8` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kupqi4/us_capitol_siege_a_wakeup_call_for_democracies/):

> I just want to say this out loud. In 2021, a US police officer guarding the Capitol building in the nations capital, was dragged by a mob, from his post, and beaten to death. This happened.

## China agrees to let in WHO team investigating Covid origins

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/11/china-agrees-to-let-in-who-team-investigating-covid-origins):

> A World Health Organization team of international experts tasked with investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic will arrive in China on 14 January, China's national health authority has said. The team was initially aiming to enter China in early January but China blocked their arrival, saying visas had not yet been approved, even as some members of the group were on their way. At the time, the WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed his dismay and said he had called on China to allow the team in: "I'm very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute," he said.
