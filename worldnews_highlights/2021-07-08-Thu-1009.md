> Hi,

> Thank you for your reporting. French person talking. In the West, with the exception of Reddit, it seems that no major media outlets cover the Ethiopian civil war, while other skirmishes (such as Israel vs Gaza) are widely reported. 
> 
> Do you feel like the Ethiopian Civil War doesn't get the attention it needs from world media, and do you have any idea why ?

> I can tell you this animal did not enjoy it very much. The only other time I've experienced heat like this was inland Mexico, many thousands of kms to the south. What made it feel especially anomalous was the lack of respite from the heat at night, which normally are very cool here, even in the dog days of summer.

## Making history: Chileans start work on first constitution equally drafted by women, men

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/making-history-chileans-start-work-first-constitution-equally-drafted-rcna1353):

> The words are linked to the fight for women's rights, which has been intensifying in recent years in Chile and is achieving milestones in the wake of the protests that rocked the country in 2019.Last Sunday, Roa attended the constitutional assembly's first convention to begin creating the world's first constitution to be drafted by an equal number of women and men. Though Roa may feel out of place in the assembly, her membership in the body of 77 women and 78 men is emblematic of its makeup and the participatory spirit of the movement that started during the estallido, as the protests are known, which in turn led to a referendum for a new magna carta, after the current one became a focus of the protests. The current constitution does not recognize Chile's Indigenous groups, treating everyone as "Chilean." During her acceptance speech, Loncón said, "It is a dream, it is part of what our ancestors have always fought for, to achieve spaces of equality and dialogue on equal terms."

> I would care less about the gender of the draftees and more whether they represent many different economic classes, personal backgrounds, maybe even things like fields of study.

## Australia left thousands of citizens stranded abroad in the pandemic. But it let the French rugby team in.

Summary of [original article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/08/australia-covid-border-restrictions-rugby/):

> On Wednesday, the French rugby team played Australia's national team, the Wallabies, in Brisbane, after entering the country last month on a charter flight under a deal arranged with the Australian government and state officials in New South Wales. "Stimulating the Australian economy is an important part of post covid-19 recovery," a spokesman for the Australian Border Force said in response to emailed questions. A New South Wales health official said the French team entered Australia under a quarantine plan approved by the state government which did not affect the number of returning Australians who could enter the state.
