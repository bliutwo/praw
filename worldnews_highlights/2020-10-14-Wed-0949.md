> For those bashing the US, the reason why the US still sails through is the act of sailing through goes a long ways in showing to international law, that China does *not* have sovereignty of the waters.
> 
> In other words, if China can prevent any other country from sailing through without permission, it effectively has sovereignty over the disputed waters. This is part of international law.
> 
> So the US is doing a service that only it can do for the countries in that region.

> Nowhere is his influence greater than in Australia, where News Corp controls about two-thirds of daily newspaper circulation, and Mr. Murdoch also controls prominent news channels like Sky News Australia. Critics have pointed to a New York Times interview, published on Saturday, with one of Mr. Murdoch's adult children, James Murdoch, who was once seen as a potential successor to run his father's business. James Murdoch said that he had resigned from the News Corp board because of growing discomfort over the agenda of Fox News and other outlets.

> Putin's gotten everything he can get out of Trump, and now its actually more in his interest if Trump loses than if he wins. If he loses, they can spread misinformation to his army of racist, violent supporters and stir up a wave of domestic terrorism that will continue to keep the US looking inward rather than at Russia.
