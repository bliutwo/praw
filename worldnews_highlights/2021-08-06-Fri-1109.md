## France makes "COVID pass" mandatory for all bars and restaurants

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-testing-france-pass-bars-restaurants):

> France - Summer in France is all about eating out with friends, sipping wine and people-watching from sidewalk cafes - but from Monday, only those who have been vaccinated or have a recent negative COVID-19 test will be able to do that. France's highest court on Thursday upheld a new law that makes it mandatory to show a "COVID pass" at cafes, bars and restaurants as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus infections. The COVID pass, which contains either a vaccination certificate or proof of a recent negative PCR or antigen test, is already required for leisure activities where 50 or more people might gather, such as concerts, museums and cinemas.

> Same in Ireland, except here they only accept that you've been vaccinated, not a negative test result or that you've recovered from covid.
