## Prince Andrew lobbied US government for better plea deal for a former friend in the disgraced late financierâ€™s underage prostitution case, newly released Ghislaine Maxwell documents claim

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-pedophile-florida-a9647851.html):

> Newly unsealed court documents claim the Duke of York allegedly lobbied the US government for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein to secure a "Favourable" plea deal in the disgraced late financier's underage prostitution case. More light has been shed on Prince Andrew's relationship with the convicted sex offender, from whom he has distanced himself, through the documents which were published after the court rejected an appeal by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell to keep them secret. "[They are] seeking documents regarding Epstein's lobbying efforts to persuade the government to give him a favourable plea arrangement, including efforts on his behalf by Andrew and former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz," claimed the victims.

## Underage girl forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, US court document claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/31/underage-girl-forced-to-have-sex-with-prince-andrew-us-court-document-jeffrey-epstein):

> The sex offender Jeffrey Epstein allegedly tried to gather incriminating material against Prince Andrew by forcing an underage girl to have sex with him, according to newly released court documents. A friend of Prince Andrew said: "The US federal appeals court said in 2019 these allegations should be treated with 'extreme caution'. Allegations are not the same as facts, which is the essential premise on which justice works. Let's see if these allegations stand up, because precious few about the duke do - where's the proof?". Similar allegations about Prince Andrew having sex with an underage girl were ordered to be struck from court records in 2015 in the civil case.

## Boris Johnson puts own brother and billionaire donor in House of Lords for life

Summary of [original article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-puts-brother-billionaire-22450311):

> Boris Johnson today put his own brother, his former boss, a billionaire Tory donor, a former top aide and a Brexiteer cricketer in the House of Lords for life. Remain-backing ex-Chancellors Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond and former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson appear on the list alongside Mr Johnson's brother Jo. Jo Johnson stood down as an MP at the last election and resigned as a minister last September, saying he was "Torn between family loyalty and the national interest" over his brother hardline approach to Brexit. The inclusion of his own brother - as well as other more political choices for the Lords - is likely to spark angry accusations of cronyism.

## One of the first ships to resume cruising is having a COVID outbreak

Summary of [original article](https://thepointsguy.com/news/covid-outbreak-hurtigruten-norway/):

> One of the first cruise ships in the world to resume sailing since the coronavirus-caused worldwide halt to departures in March is experiencing an outbreak of the illness that has already sent people to the hospital. One small-ship cruise company, UnCruise Adventures, plans to resume trips out of Juneau, Alaska, on Saturday. Gene Sloan has written about cruising for more than 25 years and for many years oversaw USA TODAY's award-winning cruise site, USA TODAY Cruises.

## Germany to ban single use plastics by 2021

Summary of [original article](https://www.cleantechexpress.com/2020/07/germany-to-ban-single-use-plastics-by.html?m=1):

> When Germany does manage to ban these products for good, items like food containers, cotton buds, plastic straws, and others will be a thing of the past. People using products through single-use plastics should be more responsible and take initiatives to refrain from using them as that would reduce the dependence on single-use plastic products. The discovery of microscopic plastic particles inside birds, aquatic animals, and others even in faraway places means the extent of pollution due to discarded plastic materials is huge and the need to tighten their usage or even completely banning them was felt acutely in many countries, including Germany.

`/u/yadoga` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i15tji/germany_to_ban_single_use_plastics_by_2021/):

> Reminder that only 16% of the world's plastic is recycled. The vast majority of plastics remains in the environment as waste, collected in landfills at best. Plastic is everywhere. And it's still increasingly ending up where it doesn't belong: In the stomach of fish and other animals and therefore.. in most of us. We can try harder to avoid plastic altogether, wherever possible.
> 
> Edit:
> 
> So after some more digging, it seems to be regarding only consumer goods: Plastic straws, plates, knives, forks etc. As pointed out by others in this thread, too. That leaves this initiative as nothing more than a nice gesture. Especially when considering the overwhelming majority (97%) of single use plastics is used by industry as pointed out here by /u/BatJew_Official as well.
> 
> 
> This is also not a Germany-only regulation: The EU is planning on banning single-use plastics in all member states from summer 2021. Again, only planned for consumer goods. IMHO this is just a tiny step forward. We need bolder regulation and higher taxes on plastics to achieve anything meaningful in a timeframe that can still help us move forward.
> 
> Edit2:
> 
> Policy is lagging / too often closely tied to industry interests. (Water is wet). We need to vote with our wallets..

## Next six months 'most critical in a generation' for climate emergency, says man behind Paris deal

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/next-six-months-most-critical-in-a-generation-for-climate-emergency-says-man-behind-paris-deal-12038485):

> In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Andrew Higham says he believes the next six months are the most critical "In a generation" for tackling the climate emergency. In 2015, nearly 200 countries signed the landmark Paris Agreement which aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C. It was drafted by Andrew Higham, who went on to co-found Mission 2020, which stated among its goals that 2020 needs to be a turning point in dealing with the climate emergency. Pete Betts says the UK is up to the job of the diplomatic "Heavy lifting" needed by a country hosting a COP. He was in charge of all climate negotiations for the UK and the EU for six years, including the Paris Agreement and knows exactly what it's like to be at the heart of the brinkmanship.

> The rich will continue to line their pockets at the expense of our planet. Oil companies will continue to bribe politicians, the farming industry will continue removing access of first day by day. It's a sad time in human history.
