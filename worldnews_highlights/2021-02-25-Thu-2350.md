## Dutch parliament: China's treatment of Uighurs is genocide

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-china-uighurs/dutch-parliament-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-is-genocide-idUSKBN2AP2CI):

> 3 Min Read.AMSTERDAM - The Dutch parliament on Thursday passed a non-binding motion saying that the treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in China amounts to genocide, the first such move by a European country. Canada passed a resolution labelling China's treatment of the Uighurs genocide earlier this week. "Recognising the atrocities that are taking place against the Uighurs in China for what they are, namely genocide, prevents the world from looking the other way and forces us into action," he told Reuters in an emailed response to questions.
