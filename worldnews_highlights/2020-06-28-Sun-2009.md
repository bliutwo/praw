> The deaths of a father and son from alleged torture at the hands of police have sparked outrage across India, with many drawing parallels with the killing of George Floyd in the United States. Their case has thrown a new spotlight on police brutality just weeks after the killing of Floyd, an African-American man, by a white police officer in the US led to worldwide protests. Several reports by human rights groups in India have detailed cases of alleged torture of suspects in custody, with deaths often blamed by police on suicide or natural causes.

> The shows set in India I've seen on Netflix and Amazon Prime all depict the police as slapping or beating up suspects (I've never been to India so that's the extent of my exposure there, I don't know how accurate it is). It's depicted like it's acceptable, like it's routine procedure. Do the protests have a snowball's chance in summertime India of propelling meaningful changes?
