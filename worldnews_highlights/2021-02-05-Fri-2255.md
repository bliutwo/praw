## Myanmar coup: Teachers join growing protests against military

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55944482):

> AFP. Myanmar's military is tightening its crackdown on the former civilian government, with the arrest of a senior leader from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party. Ms Suu Kyi and other leaders have been detained since the military launched its coup on Monday, plunging the South East Asian country into uncertainty. The military is seemingly undeterred by the disapproval, continuing down its path of consolidating power and appointing new ministers in the capital Naypyitaw, said the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. In a pre-dawn phone call with BBC Burmese, Win Htein said he was being taken to the capital by members of the police and the military.

## Jamaica faces marijuana shortage as farmers struggle

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-jamaica-kingston-coronavirus-pandemic-marijuana-2d9e9c6dbc4d311e7b7085708eca0571):

> KINGSTON, Jamaica - Jamaica is running low on ganja. Jamaica, which foreigners have long associated with pot, reggae and Rastafarians, authorized a regulated medical marijuana industry and decriminalized small amounts of weed in 2015. Heavy rains during last year's hurricane season pummeled marijuana fields that were later scorched in the drought that followed, causing tens of thousands of dollars in losses, according to farmers who cultivate pot outside the legal system.

> New Delhi: International pop star Rihanna, who created a stir in India by tweeting in support of the protesting farmers, is now under the scanner of the National Commission For Protection of Child Rights for allegedly using mica from Indian mines - where "Child labourers work in dire conditions" - in her cosmetics brand 'Fenty Beauty'. Demanding an investigation into the matter, the LRO said, "With this letter, we would like to request you to investigate whether Fenty Beauty is using uncertified mica and if true then please start appropriate penal action against the company and its owners." The RMI is a global coalition for action to enable responsible and sustainable mica supply chain in India that is free of child labour.
