## Aboriginal peoples barely own a drop of water in the vast Murray-Darling Basin water market, and First Nations groups say government inaction is denying their Indigenous rights to use the resource for environmental, social and economic purposes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/first-nations-call-on-government-to-end-water-rights-drought-20210107-p56sg4.html):

> Aboriginal peoples barely own a drop of water in the vast Murray-Darling Basin water market, and First Nations groups say government inaction is denying their Indigenous rights to use the resource for environmental, social and economic purposes. The Murray-Darling Basin water market is worth more than $16 billion, but Aboriginal organisations in NSW own just $16 million in water assets, or 0.1 per cent, according to a study from Griffith University - and First Nations groups own very little else in other states. Mr Rigney said First Nations peoples want water allocations for economic purposes in agriculture, cultural practices such as sustaining a wetland or spurring fish breeding, and to deliver good river flows for a healthy system to people downstream.

> Sometimes the mouth of the Murray dries up, despite it being one of the biggest rivers in Australia. Too much water taken from upstream.
> 
> Cotton and rice farming should be banned from buying extra water credits. We don’t have the right climate/weather patterns to ethically sustain them.

## The Polar Vortex collapse sequence has now begun, with current forecasts showing a likely increase in colder Winter weather dynamics over the United States and Europe as a response to these large-scale circulation changes.

Summary of [original article](https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/polar-vortex-collapse-winter-weather-europe-united-states-2021-fa/):

> The pattern over the United States was generally colder than in 2004, while Europe was mild to warm even at this point. Such a strong blocking of course means lower pressure in the eastern United States and over the Siberian sector and Europe. Looking at the pressure pattern forecast at that time, we can see why the snow cover advances over the United States and Europe.

Vatican City last week said it expected to receive enough COVID-19 vaccine doses in the following days to inoculate all of its residents and its workers who live beyond its walls in Rome.As part of its vaccination plan, the Vatican said it had bought an ultra-cold refrigerator to store doses, suggesting it will use the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which must be stored at about minus 70 degrees Celsius.

If indeed they would like to learn something from us, we are on the ready to provide them with our own experience and how we were able to navigate a very difficult situation that confronted us at the dawn of our democracy.

> 
> I feel like we need to make this comment to avoid people getting the wrong impression. Especially the ones who feel insulted.

> MONTREAL - The Twitter account of conspiratorial influencer Alexis Cossette-Trudel was suspended on Friday, the same day that several conspiracy theorists from the QAnon movement were also banned from the social network. Several Twitter accounts linked to the QAnon movement promoted Wednesday's demonstration on the US Capitol, a protest that turned into a deadly insurgency and which prompted Twitter to adopt new measures. The coronavirus pandemic has breathed new life into QAnon theories and accounts associated with conspiracy theorist YouTubers like Cossette-Trudel.

> 
> 
> It's almost like Twitter / Facebook etc are ONLY taking these steps NOW because the Democrats are going to be in power and they are shit scared it'll hurt their profits if they bring in changes.

## Victoria no longer flushes raw sewage into ocean after area opens treatment plant

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/victoria-sewage-plant-1.5867582):

> The Greater Victoria area no longer uses surrounding ocean waters to flush away raw effluent now that a $775 million sewage plant has started treating the equivalent of 43 Olympic-sized pools of waste daily. British Columbia Premier John Horgan told Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in the video call that Victoria started dumping its raw sewage into ocean waters that flow toward Puget Sound in the United States in 1894. Unique local efforts to clean up sewage treatment in Victoria also helped bring the treatment plant to completion, said James Skwarok, who became known as Mr. Floatie because he appeared at public events dressed in a brown suit that resembled excrement.
