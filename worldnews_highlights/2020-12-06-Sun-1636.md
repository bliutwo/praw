## Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated to 'critical' level due to climate change

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/great-barrier-reef-deteriorated-critical-level-due-climate/story?id=74569794):

> The damage to the reef is a result of ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather, which has resulted in coral bleaching, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's 2020 World Heritage Outlook report, which tracks whether the conservation of the world's 252 natural World Heritage sites is sufficient to protect them in the long term. "Natural World Heritage sites are amongst the world's most precious places, and we owe it to future generations to protect them," Bruno Oberle, the IUCN director general, said in a statement. "The IUCN World Heritage Outlook 3 reveals the damage climate change is wreaking on natural World Heritage, from shrinking glaciers to coral bleaching to increasingly frequent and severe fires and droughts. As the international community defines new objectives to conserve biodiversity, this report signals the urgency with which we must tackle environmental challenges together at the planetary scale."

> Because the oceans absorb two thirds of all emissions, ocean acidification progresses much faster than global warming.
> 
> Basically, even if we limit emissions to 1.5 or 2 degrees warming, the oceanic reefs cannot be saved. 
> 
> If we wanted to save the reefs, we would have needed to curb emissions in the 1980s and 1990s with nuclear technology.
> 
> But after Chernobyl, fossil fuels were seen as preferable and hence we live in a world where ocean reefs will all die out and cannot be saved.

## 'Devastating': more than 61,000 koalas among 3 billion animals affected by bushfire crisis

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/07/devastating-more-than-61000-koalas-among-3-billion-animals-affected-by-bushfire-crisis):

> Almost 3 billion animals, including 2.46 billion reptiles, were in the path of the flames, the report says - the same number the team calculated in an interim report, revealed in July by the Guardian. Among the 143 million mammals affected were one million wombats, 5 million kangaroos and wallabies, 5 million bats, 39 million possums and gliders and 50 million native mice and rats. The team wrote that because of a lack of data and knowledge of how species might survive, as well as uncertainties with how fire interacted with other threats, they couldn't be sure how many of the 3 billion animals died.

## UN Secretary General says misinformation on Covid-19 is ‘shadow pandemic’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/coronavirus-conspiracy-united-nations-un-covid-pandemic-b1767067.html):

> UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a stark warning about increased dependence on digital technology, which he claims is heightening vulnerability to harm and abuse - particularly in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking in a UN web summit, Mr Guterres said "Health and lives" have been put "At risk" by "The shadow pandemic of misinformation about Covid?19". With a Covid vaccine to be disseminated across the UK within the next few days, and other countries with their own vaccines in the final stages of testing, a major concern from Mr Guterres is the interaction between conspiracy theories and public opinion on inoculations.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-election-protests-idUSKBN28G0I5):

> 2 Min Read.MOSCOW - Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Belarus capital Minsk and elsewhere on Sunday as weekly protests demanding the resignation of veteran President Alexander Lukashenko continued, prompting police to detain more than 300 people. Belarus, a country of 9.5 million that Russia sees as a security buffer against NATO, has been rocked by mass protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election which Lukashenko said he won. In Minsk alone, the police detained more than 300 people accused of "Violating the law on mass events", Russia's TASS news agency quoted the Belarus interior ministry as saying.

> If your fellow citizens decide to side with Lukashenko rather than the "people", the country may not be united as media make it seem against the dictator.

## Israeli police cleared in shooting of maimed Palestinian boy

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-police-cleared-shooting-maimed-palestinian-boy-74568316?cid=clicksource_4380645_8_heads_posts_card_hed):

> JERUSALEM - Israeli authorities have cleared police of any wrongdoing in the case of a 9-year-old boy who lost an eye after apparently being shot in the face by an Israeli officer earlier this year. In a statement sent to The Associated Press on Saturday, the Israeli Justice Ministry said its unit for internal police investigations concluded that while the incident was "Sad," there were insufficient grounds for prosecution after interviewing witnesses and reviewing video footage and other evidence. Police blame the violence on local youths, whom they accuse of throwing stones and firebombs at patrol vehicles.

## National rugby players sing Australia's national anthem in Indigenous language for first time before match

> The trouble is that there are hundreds of Indigenous languages in Australia, with 28 language families, which makes it hard to have AN Aboriginal anthem. As a kid growing up in Australia we learnt "Pokarekare Ana", the unofficial kiwi Maori anthem, but there wasn't an Indigenous Australian equivalent.

## Police officer who retired after novichok poisoning 'fighting for pension', says wife

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/06/police-officer-retired-novichok-poisoning-salisbury-fighting-for-pension):

> The wife of Nick Bailey, the detective who left Wiltshire police after being poisoned in the Salisbury novichok attack, has said he is still fighting for part of his pension. A spokesperson for Wiltshire police said: "Since Nick Bailey found himself at the centre of the novichok international incident, Wiltshire police have worked with him and his family to provide continuing support to help them deal with the impact of this terrible incident and assist him to try and return to active police duties."It was with great sadness that regrettably this was not possible, and Nick left the force in October 2020 with our very best wishes for the future. Explaining why he had been forced to leave, Bailey said: "After 18 years in the police force I've had to admit defeat and accept that I can no longer do the job. I wanted to be a police officer since I was a teenager, I couldn't envisage doing anything else, which is why this makes me so sad."Like most police officers, I've experienced my fair share of trauma, violence, upset, injury and grief.

> Poor guy. You'd think after just surviving that, they would try to make it a bit easier for him.
