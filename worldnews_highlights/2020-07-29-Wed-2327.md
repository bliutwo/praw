## India increases spending on education to 6% of GDP

Summary of [original article](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-education/india-approves-plan-to-boost-state-spending-on-education-to-6-of-gdp-idINKCN24U1R3):

> NEW DELHI - India on Wednesday approved a plan to allow foreign universities to open campuses in the country as part of efforts to boost education to strengthen the economy as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The change comes as part of a policy to increase public spending on education to nearly 6% of gross domestic product from around 4% now. The government is seeking to expand access to higher education to 50% of high school students by 2035, aiming to add about 35 million new places for students, and achieve universal adult literacy before that date, Higher Education Secretary Amit Khare told reporters.

`/u/Gammelpreiss` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/i051bz/india_increases_spending_on_education_to_6_of_gdp/):

> There is nothing better then investment in education. To this day I can't get my head around that some countries treat that like a priviledge in face of every growing competition in intellectually challenging fields. 
> 
> In Germany education is generally seen as an asset in global competition, though the government in the last couple decades really fell asleep in this area.
> 
> Still, at least education is free, making sure everybody at least gets a chance to really make their potential work for the country.

## Germany has become the new "frontline" of the West's Cold War with Russia and China, but "no longer feels it can rely on the US" for protection, according to a new report.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-is-growing-target-for-china-and-russia-cannot-rely-on-trump-report-says-2020-7):

> Germany has become the new "Frontline" of the West's Cold War with Russia and China, but "No longer feels it can rely on the US" for protection, according to a new report. Reas Michaelis, Germany's ambassador to the UK, recently told Business Insider that "Shortcomings" in Germany's relationship with the US meant that working with the Trump administration is now "Not easy."
