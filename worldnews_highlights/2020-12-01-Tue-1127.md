## An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/hungarian-mep-resigns-breaking-covid-rules-gay-orgy-brussels-2020-12):

> József Szájer resigned as an MEP on Sunday after he admitted breaching Belgium's strict lockdown rules to attend a sex party, Politico reported. A source close to the police investigation said officers were prompted to attend to the scene after "a legal complaint for night-time disturbance." The public prosecutor's office said: "A passer-by reported to the police that he had seen a man fleeing along the gutter; he was able to identify the man. The man's hands were bloody. It is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing. Narcotics were found in his backpack. The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence, where he identified himself as S. J. by means of a diplomatic passport."

## UN: Food has run out for nearly 100,000 refugees in Ethiopia

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/international-news-eritrea-abiy-ahmed-ethiopia-united-nations-344e7156295eb1801f9441a9359c2dab):

> NAIROBI, Kenya - The United Nations says food has now run out for the nearly 100,000 refugees from Eritrea who have been sheltering in camps in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, which has been cut off from the world for nearly a month amid fighting. The U.N. has said some 2 million people in Tigray now need assistance - a doubling from the number before the fighting - and some 1 million people are displaced, including more than 45,000 Ethiopians who have fled into Sudan as refugees. "UNHCR appeals to the government of Ethiopia to continue to fulfill its responsibility in hosting and protecting Eritrean refugees and allow humanitarians to access people who are now desperately in need."

> "The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis "of biblical proportions", or "hunger pandemic". This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way."

## Germany bans far-right, pro-Nazi group, police raid homes

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/international-news-horst-seehofer-germany-2129b08825bbc2a60d23059a4f36ee28):

> BERLIN - More than 180 police officers raided homes in three German states early Tuesday after the German government banned a far-right group, the interior ministry said. The homes of 11 members of the far-right group Wolfsbrigade 44 were searched in Hesse, Mecklenburg West-Pomerania and North Rhine-Westphalia to confiscate the group's funds and far-right propaganda material, the German news agency dpa reported. ADVERTISEMENT.The members of the group want to re-establish a Nazi dictatorship and abolish democracy, the interior ministry said.

## Huge Puerto Rico radio telescope collapses; many mourning

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-0da6abb251f455977bf0c752348e712e):

> "It's a huge loss," said Carmen Pantoja, an astronomer and professor at the University of Puerto Rico who used the telescope for her doctorate. The LIDAR facilities are still operational, along with a 12-meter telescope and a photometer used to study photons in the atmosphere, Vázquez said. Scientists had used the telescope to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed.

`/u/Andromeda321` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k4k85y/huge_puerto_rico_radio_telescope_collapses_many/):

> Radio astronomer here- this is a sad day for science. We will never see the likes of Arecibo again and I literally have colleagues crying right now, not just because of the science lost but because Arecibo was so close to many lives. (Many got their first start in the field at Arecibo through its student programs, I know at least one couple that met there, and it was iconic in Puerto Rican identity.)
> 
> FAQ, along with my post last week that addressed a lot of the questions then:
> 
> **What happened?** There was a cable break in August, followed by a main cable break holding the gigantic 900 ton feed horn (that James Bond ran on- or rather his stunt double, astronomers bragged Pierce Brosnan was too scared to do what they do every day), and it looks like the entire thing finally collapsed onto the dish below. It was the size of the house and where all the expensive equipment was. 
> 
> **Can they fix it?** No. This is the equivalent on an optical telescope of the bottom where your eyepiece/camera falling out and smashing a hole in the mirror. It’s gone. 
> 
> **Did they save any of the millions of dollars of equipment?** Again, no. It was far too dangerous to get into the horn once the main cable snapped and engineering reports indicate they were keeping people *very* far from it. For good reason based on this development...
> 
> **What happens now?** The NSF is under contract to return the telescope site to its original natural state so I guess the demolition will begin. There is not money or interest in rebuilding this magnificent engineering marvel. 
> 
> *Q&A from last week*
> 
> To answer some questions you might have:
> 
> **It's a 50 year old telescope- was it still doing good science?** Short answer: yes.  Arecibo has had a storied history doing a lot of great radio astronomy- while [its SETI days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) are behind it (it hasn't really done SETI in years) the telescope has done a ton of amazing science over the years- in fact, Arecibo gave us one Nobel Prize for the [discovery of the first binary pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1937%2B21) (which was the first indirect discovery of gravitational waves!).  More recently, Arecibo was [the first radio telescope on the planet to discover a repeating Fast Radio Burst \(FRB\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst#FRB_121102)- the newest class of weird radio signal- which was a giant milestone in our quest to understand what they are (we now think they are probably from a souped up type of pulsar, called a magnetar, thanks in large part to the work Arecibo has done).  Finally, Arecibo was also a huge partner in [nanoGRAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Nanohertz_Observatory_for_Gravitational_Waves)- an amazing group aiming to detect gravitational waves via measuring pulsars really carefully- so that's a huge setback there.
> 
> **Can't other radio telescopes just pick up the slack?** Yes and no.  [FAST in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope) is an amazing dish that's even bigger than Arecibo, so that'll be great, but right now is still pretty limited in the kind of science it can do.  Second, it doesn't really have the capability to transmit and receive like Arecibo does- Arecibo was basically the biggest interplanetary radar out there, and FAST has said they might do that but it's not currently clear the timeline on that- Arecibo would do this to update the shape and orbits of asteroids that might hit Earth someday using radar, for example, so we just don't have that capability anymore.
> 
> Beyond that, you could of course do *some* science Arecibo has been traditionally doing on telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBI), but those are oversubscribed- there are literally only so many hours in a day, and right now the VLA for example will receive proposals for 2-3x as much telescope time as they can give.  Losing Arecibo means getting telescope time is now going to be that much more competitive.
> 
> **Why don't we just build a bigger telescope?  One on the far side of the moon sounds great!** I agree!  But good Lord, Arecibo has been struggling for *years* because the NSF couldn't scratch together a few million dollars to keep it running, which probably led to the literal dish falling apart.  Do you really think a nation that can't find money to perform basic maintenance is going to cough up to build a radio telescope on the far side of the moon anytime soon?!  Radio astronomy funding has been *disastrous* in recent years, with our flagship observatories literally falling apart, and the best future instruments are now being constructed abroad (FAST in China, SKA in South Africa/Australia).  Chalk this up as a symbol for American investment in science as a whole, really...
> 
> So yeah, there we have it- it's a sad day for me.  I actually was lucky enough to [visit Arecibo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/d49tz7/i_think_im_going_to_need_a_bigger_antenna/) just over [a year ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/4oW7RTr) (on my honeymoon!), and I'm really happy now that I had the chance to see the telescope in person that's inspired so much.  And I'm also really sad right now because science aside, a lot of people are now going to lose their jobs, and I know how important Arecibo was to Puerto Rico, both in terms of education/science but as a cultural icon.
> 
> TL;DR this is a sad day for American science.  We will definitely know a little less about the universe for no longer having the Arecibo Observatory in it.

## China's Hainan province bans the production, sale and use of disposable plastic products starting December 1st

Summary of [original article](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2020/12/01/china039s-hainan-province-bans-disposable-plastic-products):

> HAIKOU: Disposable plastic bags and tableware that are non-degradable have been banned from production, sale and use starting Tuesday in China's island province of Hainan. Starting in August, the province launched a pilot programme on phasing out single-use non-degradable plastic products in places such as Party and government organizations, state-owned enterprises, schools, tourist attractions, big supermarkets and hospitals. China in January released a plan to ban or significantly reduce the production and use of environmentally-unfriendly plastic products in the next five years to contain pollution.

> The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, comprising more than 200 MPs from a range of political parties and representing 19 country legislatures, has launched a campaign to convince people to buy and drink Australian wine in December, as a show of solidarity. It comes after China slapped tariffs of up to 212 per cent against Australian wine producers, which Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said would spell a "Hellishly tough time for Australia's winemakers." A video campaign has also been launched by an alliance of politicians from around the world to convince people to buy and drink Australian wine amid growing tensions with Beijing.

## Photo reveals Australian soldier drinking beer out of dead Taliban fighter's prosthetic leg

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/01/photo-reveals-australian-soldier-drinking-dead-taliban-prosthetic-leg?CMP=twt_b-gdnnews&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1606804086):

> Senior Australian special forces soldiers drank beer out of the prosthetic leg of a dead Taliban soldier at an unauthorised bar in Afghanistan - with a photograph of the act being revealed for the first time by Guardian Australia. A number of photographs obtained by the Guardian show one senior soldier - who is still serving - sculling from the leg in an unofficial bar known as the Fat Lady's Arms, which was set up inside Australia's special forces base in Tarin Kowt, the capital of Uruzgan province, in 2009.Another appears to show two soldiers performing a dance with the leg. The emergence of the picture of Australian armed forces drinking beer from a dead man's prosthetic leg comes at a particularly tense time for the Australian government.
