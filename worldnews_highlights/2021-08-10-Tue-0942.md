## Hong Kong's largest teachers union -formed in 1973- disbands just a week after Chinese state media called it of being "a tumor that must be eradicated", this union consisted of 90% of all education practitioners in the territory.

Summary of [original article](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1605225-20210810.htm):

> The Professional Teachers' Union announced on Tuesday that it is disbanding, around a week after the government severed ties with the body as it came under attack by state media. The government's move came soon after state media attacked the pro-democracy group and called for it to be eradicated. Representing almost 100,000 members, the PTU was not just the largest teachers' group in Hong Kong, but also the biggest union for a single profession.

## Anti-Vaxxers Tried to Storm the BBC. They Got the Wrong Building.

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqjz/anti-vaxxers-attempt-to-storm-bbc-but-target-building-bbc-moved-out-of-in-2013):

> Anti-vaccine passport protesters clashed with police as they tried to storm a London television studio that is mostly used to make daytime TV shows. Footage circulated on social media showed shoving between protesters and a line of police officers who are guarding an entrance to a studio at the Television Centre in White City, West London. While Television Centre was once the BBC HQ, it is now mainly used to make light entertainment TV shows and also includes flats, raising the question of why protesters targeted it.

## Aluminum cans slowly replace plastics in Japan to tackle marine pollution

Summary of [original article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/08/09/national/aluminum-cans-recycling/):

> All 12 teas and soft drinks sold by Ryohin Keikaku Co., operator of retail brand Muji, have been provided in aluminum cans since April after data showed the rate of "Horizontal recycling," which allows for the reuse of materials in a comparable function, was substantially higher for such cans compared to plastic bottles. The move toward efficient recycling has also been gaining traction abroad. Mineral water was supplied in aluminum cans at the Group of Seven summit in June in Britain, while consumer goods giant Unilever PLC said in April, it would begin selling shampoo in aluminum bottles in the United States. From July, the group began spreading information about aluminum cans via its social networking site and plans to hold an art contest using such cans later this year to raise awareness.

`/u/Silent-JET` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/p19e6a/aluminum_cans_slowly_replace_plastics_in_japan_to/):

> Had a party recently and got aluminum cups instead of plastic. They were amazing! Sturdier than plastic, more eco-friendly, and cost about the same as traditional red Solo cups.
> 
> I’d love to see this trend continue to take off!

## Employers will be able to ask their staff if they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so they can guard against infections in the workplace, under federal guidance finalised on Tuesday morning.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/employers-given-clearance-to-ask-workers-to-reveal-vaccinations-20210810-p58hgv.html):

> "We are not going to seek to impose a mandatory vaccination program by the government, by stealth. That is not what we're going to do. There are already existing powers that employers have, both in terms of lawful directions, reasonable directions to their employers." "We again call on the federal government to extend the same indemnity to employers who vaccinate their willing workers at the workplace as is enjoyed by doctors, pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies," Mr Willox said. "Indemnity has nothing to do with mandating vaccinations which is an entirely separate issue. It is about reducing the risk for employers who may still face an expensive workplace claim. Employers are very keen to help speed up the vaccination effort in the workplace and an extension of indemnity to them would make this more attractive for many more employers."

> Just to be clear, this is in Australia.
> 
> In the US there is nothing preventing your employer from asking your vaccination status, despite what facebook has told you
