> This looks like political grandstanding: making a bold noisey statement law that's not been thought through. It's not going to affect anything when conviction rates are low and reporting rates are abysmal because society punishes the victims more than the perpetrators.

## Hindu hardliners have attacked and set fire to the home of a former Indian foreign minister. Salman Khurshid published a book last month in which he compared Hindu nationalism under Modi to extremist groups such as ISIL

Summary of [original article](https://m.thewire.in/article/communalism/salman-khurshids-nainital-home-vandalised-days-after-controversy-over-hindutva-remarks-in-book):

> New Delhi: Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid's Nainital home was allegedly vandalised and set on fire on Monday, November 15, days after it became known that his book on Ayodhya drew parallels between Hindutva groups and terrorist organisations, such as Boko Haram and ISIS, drawing the ire of the BJP and Hindu fundamentalist groups. The Congress leader has been at the centre of criticism from BJP and Hindutva groups after it became known that his book Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, released on November 10, contained observations on Hindutva politics and how religion was being used to reap electoral dividends by the BJP. Hindutva groups objected to a particular passage in the book, which reads as follows: "Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years." Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had said that Khurshid drawing parallels between Hindutva groups and global terror outfits amounted to "Exaggeration".

> Social media platforms are biased against facts and creating "a virus of lies" that threatens all democracies, the Nobel peace prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa has said. Ressa, one of the Philippines' most prominent journalists, said social media platforms were "Manipulating our minds insidiously, creating alternate realities, making it impossible for us to think slow". Speaking at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's Sydney Dialogue, Ressa accused social media companies of misusing arguments around freedom of speech.

## Taiwan opens office in Lithuania, brushing aside China opposition

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-opens-office-lithuania-brushing-aside-china-opposition-2021-11-18/):

> REUTERS/Ann Wang.TAIPEI, Nov 18 - Taiwan opened a de facto embassy in Lithuania on Thursday in a diplomatic breakthrough for the Chinese-claimed island, brushing aside Beijing's strong opposition to the move. China demanded in August that the Baltic state withdraw its ambassador to Beijing and said it would recall China's envoy in Vilnius after Taiwan announced its office in the city would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania. Taiwan's foreign ministry said the opening of the office would "Charter a new and promising course" for ties between it and Lithuania.

> EU should work close with Taiwan, maybe in future we could have semiconductors fabs in EU.
