## WHO urges fully vaccinated people to continue to wear masks as delta Covid variant spreads

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/delta-who-urges-fully-vaccinated-people-to-continue-to-wear-masks-as-variant-spreads.html):

> The World Health Organization on Friday urged fully vaccinated people to continue to wear masks, social distance and practice other Covid-19 pandemic safety measures as the highly contagious delta variant spreads rapidly across the globe. WHO officials said they are asking fully vaccinated people to continue to "Play it safe" because a large portion of the world remains unvaccinated and highly contagious variants, like delta, are spreading in many countries, spurring outbreaks. Still, there are signs the delta strain could provoke different symptoms than other variants.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-seeks-ban-british-travellers-eu-covid-19-variant-worries-times-2021-06-27/):

> June 28 - Germany will attempt to ban British travellers from the European Union regardless of whether or not they have had a COVID-19 vaccine, The Times reported on Monday. German chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Chequers next week. Britain plans to unveil plans next month to allow fully vaccinated people to travel unrestricted to all countries except those with the highest COVID-19 risk.

`/u/NewCrashingRobot` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/o9gz7d/germany_seeks_to_ban_british_travellers_from_eu/):

> >The plans will be discussed by senior European and national officials on the EU's integrated political crisis response committee and will be resisted by Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal, the newspaper added.
> 
> Northern European countries that don't rely to a large degree on tourism want to close borders completely. Southern European countries that have been missing tourist money for 18 months want to open them up.
> 
> Surely requiring travellers to be fully vaccinated + have a negative PCR test before flying is the sensible middle ground?

## Biden orders airstrikes on Iran-backed militias near Iraq-Syria border in response to UAV attacks

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/biden-orders-airstrikes-iran-backed-militias-iraq-syria/story?id=78526157):

> The U.S. said the strikes were "To protect U.S. personnel in Iraq.". "The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.". Since Feb. 25, there have been five "One-way UAV attacks," as well as "Dozens of rocket attacks," on U.S. and coalition facilities in the region, which is what spurred Sunday's airstrikes, the official said.

> You want to protect US personnel?
> 
> Get them the hell out of Iraq. It is what the vast majority of people in this country want. Why the fuck are we fighting Iran-backed people there when the point of the recent conflict was to fight ISIS, a group the Iranians and their allies also hate?

> 
> 1990s: US fights Saddam because he invaded Kuwait, then sanctions the shit out of his country, indirectly causing hundreds of thousands of civilians deaths
> 
> 2003: Invade Iraq to "fight terrorism". Create vastly more terrorism than existed previously. Also, the new elected government leans pro-Iran.
> 
> 2010s: Go back in to fight ISIS
> 
> 2021: Back to stopping the spread of Iranian influence, apparently.
> 
> Fuck everything about this.

## As life gradually returns to normal in Europe, there has been a resurgence of deadly violence against women as abusers experience a "loss of the control" they enjoyed throughout the coronavirus lockdowns

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210628-as-pandemic-eases-fatal-gender-violence-worsens-in-europe):

> "With women gaining more freedom, the aggressors feel as if they're losing control and react with more extreme violence," explained Victoria Rosell, head of the Spanish government's taskforce against gender violence. In that light, the recent increase in deadly violence was "Foreseeable", she told AFP. Under normal circumstances, such violence is often triggered by a divorce or separation, or when an ex-partner starts a new relationship - situations which have been largely put on hold during the lockdown. "Once the state of emergency and the lockdowns ended, many victims took things into their own hands and decided to leave," explained Carmen Ruiz Repullo, a sociologist who specialises in gender violence.

`/u/5oclockinthebank` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/o9cmfs/as_life_gradually_returns_to_normal_in_europe/):

> Oh.  This makes sense.  I had heard that the women's shelters in our town were incredibly underused in pandemic time.  It was pretty terrifying to me.  Stay safe, everyone.  There is a way out.

## France elections: Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron suffer humiliating results in regional vote | France's far-right have endured another miserable night in the country's regional elections, with Marine Le Pen's National Rally failing to win any of the dozen mainland areas where it stood.

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/marine-le-pen-and-emmanuel-macron-suffer-humiliating-results-in-french-regional-elections-12343542):

> France's far-right have endured another miserable night in the country's regional elections, with Marine Le Pen's National Rally failing to win any of the dozen mainland areas where it stood. Mr Macron's ruling Republique en Marche party, which did not exist at the time of the last regional vote in 2015, also failed to secure a single region of its own - a humiliating set of results for the country's leader. The regional elections had been viewed by pundits as a litmus test for whether Ms Le Pen's anti-immigration party enjoyed much acceptability ahead of next year's presidential poll.

`/u/green_flash` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/o95k8c/france_elections_marine_le_pen_and_emmanuel/):

> What's most humiliating for all politicians is the exceptionally low turnout. 
> 
> Seriously, 33% turnout in the first round and around 35% in the second round should be a real wake-up call for everyone.
