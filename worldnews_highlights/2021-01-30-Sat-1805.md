## COVID-19: Life won't return to normal for at least two years, expert warns, saying pandemic 'isn't over until it's over globally'

> Life globally will not return to normal for two or three years based on the rate of the current vaccination rollout, it has been warned - but there are early signs jabs are reducing cases in the UK. Speaking to Sky News, Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at London School of Economics, said the COVID-19 pandemic will not be over until the world's population is protected. "This pandemic isn't going to be over until it's over globally," Dr Wenham said. "We're still going to be living in some form of restrictions - travel restrictions, border controls - even when we're vaccinated, until it's over round the world. So there's a real imperative to make sure that everybody round the world has at least minimum levels of vaccines at the same time."

> Social endings typically happen far before medical endings to pandemics. Yes there will continue to be outbreaks for years, but once people get vaccinated, they will start going back to normal. It's inevitable.

## Kim Jong Un’s wife has been missing from the public eye for more than a year

Summary of [original article](https://www.nknews.org/2021/01/kim-jong-uns-wife-has-been-missing-from-the-public-eye-for-more-than-a-year/):

> Image: KCTV. The wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been missing from the public eye for more than a year now, leading some analysts to wonder what happened to the country's breakout first lady. Ri Sol Ju, who is thought to be 32 years old, was last seen in state media sitting next to Kim at Pyongyang's Samjiyon Theater for a Lunar New Year's Day performance that took place on Jan. 25, 2020. Before she disappeared from state media, Ri was the first wife of a North Korean leader to repeatedly appear next to her husband in public - and experts now say that her missing status suggests that Kim no longer cares to look like a "Normal world leader."

> What is the North Korean “public eye” exactly - is that what they leak to the rest of the world?

> China 'threatens war' with Philippines as US pledges support to Manila - NZ Herald China's President Xi Jinping 'threatened war' with the Philippines this week. Now, US President Joe Biden has "Underscored that the United States rejects China's maritime claims in the South China Sea to the extent they exceed the maritime zones that China is permitted to claim under international law". The law "Is virtually a declaration of war against countries that are legitimate claimants of the Chinese-claimed marine territory," fishing federation chairman Fernando Hicap told the Hong Kong based South China Morning Post.MilitarisationConcern has been growing at the militarisation of China's civilian coast guard and fishing fleets.

> Is it just me or is the headline a little bit misleading? 
> 
> The impression I get from reading the headline is that China was quoted to be “threatening the Philippines with war”, when the quote is actually somebody else (Filipino foreign minister) saying that “China’s actions threaten peace”.
