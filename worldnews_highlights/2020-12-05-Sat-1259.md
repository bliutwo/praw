`/u/juanTressel` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k75v7e/argentina_has_passed_a_new_tax_on_its_wealthiest/):

> This tax doesn't include people who have tax residency abroad and have their property and wealth abroad, which is the majority of Argentina's wealthiest people. [Including the late Diego Maradona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3I0_2r67T0).
> 
> Argentina [*already has* a wealth tax](https://www.afip.gob.ar/gananciasYBienes/bienes-personales/conceptos-basicos/que-es.asp) for wealths in excess of ARS 3 million (USD 37000 using the official exchange rate, USD 20700 using the blue-chip rate), paying from 0.5% up to 1.25% of the total person's worth (not *net* worth: it doesn't take debts into account). 
> 
> I'm sure the sophomoric Reddit userbase will side with this tax regardless of how it was implemented because "tax the rich" is enough for them, but considering that this new wealth tax not only taxes illiquid assets but also doesn't take into account passives (debt incurred), this could end up being a disaster for businesses, even medium-size businesses: the lowest rate will require to pay ARS 4 million, which few people have *in cash*. They will have to liquidate assets, which will directly impact private investment at a time in which unemployment nears the record 25% rate of 2002.

> Edit- I know there's no direct correlation. You can stop missing the point. Billions in profits and it'll go to continue the war machine and line fat cats pockets while we go pointlessly bankrupt over basic health issues.

## Guests at Brussels 'daddy orgy' thought cops were part of the act, host claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9017489/Guests-Brussels-daddy-orgy-thought-cops-act-host-claims.html):

> Guests at the Brussels 'daddy orgy' where an anti-LGBT politician was caught breaking lockdown rules thought the police who arrived to break up the party were part of the romp, the organiser claims. Manzheley told Polish outlet Onet that he sometimes has 100 guests at his parties including politicians from Poland, Hungary, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Spain and Ukraine. While the orgies are normally entirely legal, police closed down Friday's party because it was breaking lockdown rules, following what Manzheley suspected was a tip-off by a rival sex party organiser in Brussels.
