## Japanese city of Akashi to certify same-sex couples, children as ‘family’; a first in Japan.

Summary of [original article](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14011265):

> AKASHI, Hyogo Prefecture-Akashi city in January will become the first local government in Japan to introduce a partnership system that treats the children of same-sex couples as "Family," city officials said on Dec. 10. While the planned system is not legally binding at the national level, it will allow same-sex couples in the city to change their relationships from "Roommates" to "Relatives" in their residence certificates, effectively recognizing them and their children as equivalent to a family, according to the city. The Japanese government does not recognize same-sex marriages, but around 70 municipalities nationwide have introduced systems to certify same-sex couples as equivalent to married couples.

After tracking Pevchikh and then Navalny to the airport in Moscow, agent Tayakin remained at the Akademika Vargi Street headquarters day and night for the duration of Navalny's six-day Siberia trip, communicating constantly with the teams in the field and apparently napping at the office when he could. Reprisals for FSB.Just over a week after Navalny was wheeled into Berlin's Charité hospital, still in a coma, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that lab results showed "Beyond a doubt" that the poisoning was "An attempted murder with nerve agent." The European Union then imposed sanctions on several senior officials, including the director of the FSB, Aleksandr Bortnikov, saying he was "Responsible for providing support to the persons who carried out or were involved in the poisoning" of Navalny.
