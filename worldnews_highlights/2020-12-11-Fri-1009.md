> "Voting to legalize abortion" should be thought of as "voting for the state to intervene to make abortions safe for the mother". 
> 
> Abortions happen whether they are illegal or not, this is a fact. Making them illegal only makes them way more dangerous because of back-street or even self-administered procedures.
> 
> Everyone in the world wants to minimize the total number of abortions and minimize harm. Ideally no abortions would ever need to happen, but this is simply not realistic. At all. Promoting the use of contraception, making contraception free and very accessible, and making abortions legal and safe and accessible are the absolute best ways to minimize the number of abortions and minimize harm to women. 
> 
> If you're in the no-abortions-ever camp then I genuinely respect your position. I totally see the argument that says abortions are a red line that cannot be crossed, even if I disagree. However you then *have* to be pro-contraception because *that is how you minimize the need for abortions*. If you are anti-abortion, anti-contraception, and hence, presumably, pro-abstinence, then you are being hilariously, dangerously unrealistic.

> I especially like the idea that they can hack, take over, and add incriminating data to your computer. It is like they think that no law enforcement agency would ever think to incriminate someone.

## China sends Uighur Muslims to "re-education" camps simply for being young, or for making a phone call to a family member abroad

> I've been following these articles for a while and some things are undeniable. There are [satellite images](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/25/world/asia/xinjiang-china-religious-site.html) showing where mosques have been turned into parks or dirt. There are camps that first "didn't exist" and now are re-education camps. There are factories where people don't get to go home, and these look like forced labor. We see reports of these same practices in Tibet as well.

> 
> Over time you look to see if a story starts to make more or less sense as data accumulates. You can link your lovely youtube videos and you can blame it on the Fulan cult and you can criticize human rights watch and smear Adrian Zenz, and you can "what about" all day with Iraq and DHS and coca cola and whatever, but the more we learn the more it looks like what it looks like.
> 
> Two more interesting links:
> 
> Someone asked for more sat pics. [Here are some](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-show-china-destroys-mosques-to-install-police-state-on-muslims-2019-4). 
> To be fair to China, some of what is complained about in this article is just modernization of the city. But some looks to be targeted removal of domes and religious symbolism.
> 
> This one tries to make the case that China cares so much about 
> Xinjiang because of location, location, location and [the BRI](https://www.businessinsider.com/map-explains-china-crackdown-on-uighur-muslims-in-xinjiang-2019-2). It's not just targeting minorities for religion/terrorism, it's for business. 
> 
> but most importantly from that article I learned this:
> 
> > its campaign of repression only stepped up in the past two years, under the rule of Chen Quanguo, a Communist Party secretary who previously designed the program of intensive surveillance in Tibet.
