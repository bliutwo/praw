## Ottawa announcing plan to help Hong Kongers come to Canada amid Chinese crackdown

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7458030/canada-hong-kong-security-law-crackdown/):

> The Canadian government is rolling out three new streams of measures to help Hong Kong residents come to Canada, and stressing no one charged under the widely condemned national security law imposed by China or similar contentious laws will be barred from coming to Canada. One will be for Hong Kong residents living in Canada who have graduated within the last three years from a "Recognized Canadian learning institution" and have completed at last of their courses in Canada. While the Canadian government has issued condemnation after condemnation, it has repeatedly refused to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for the imposition of what they bill as a national security law granting broad powers to stifle opposition voices and criminalize dissent, even from abroad. Canada has instead frozen its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and stopped allowing the export of sensitive technologies to the region, noting the new law effectively means such extradition or export requests must be treated as if they were coming from the Chinese regime itself.

## French professor faces disciplinary case over hydroxychloroquine claims

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/12/covid-professor-didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine):

> A French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - will appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches, an order of doctors has said. On Thursday, the order confirmed it had given the go-ahead for a disciplinary hearing after reviewing the complaints against Raoult. Raoult, who heads the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, said in March that his study of 80 patients showed "Favourable" outcomes in four out of five treated with hydroxychloroquine.
