> More than 10,000 Thai protesters chanting "Down with dictatorship" and "The country belongs to the people" rallied in Bangkok on Sunday in by far the biggest anti-government demonstration since a 2014 coup. Students have led protests almost daily for the past month, but Sunday's demonstration drew a broader crowd in the Southeast Asian country, which has experienced decades of protests punctuated by military coups. "The prime minister sends his concern to officials and protesters to avoid violence," Traisulee Traisoranakul, a government spokeswoman, told reporters.

## Scientists See Signs of Lasting Immunity to Covid-19, Even After Mild Infections

> >To the immune system, not all germs are equally memorable. But our body’s cells seem to be seriously studying up on the coronavirus.
> 
> >Scientists who have been monitoring immune responses to the virus are now starting to see encouraging signs of strong, lasting immunity, even in people who developed only mild symptoms of Covid-19, a flurry of new studies suggests. Disease-fighting antibodies, as well as immune cells called B cells and T cells that are capable of recognizing the virus, appear to persist months after infections have resolved — an encouraging echo of the body’s enduring response to other viruses.
> 
> >“Things are really working as they’re supposed to,” said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona and an author on one of the new studies, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.
> 
> >Although researchers cannot forecast how long these immune responses will last, many experts consider the data a welcome indication that the body’s most studious cells are doing their job — and will have a good chance of fending off the coronavirus, faster and more fervently than before, if exposed to it again.
> 
> >“This is exactly what you would hope for,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington and an author on another of the new studies, which is currently under review at the journal Nature. “All the pieces are there to have a totally protective immune response.”
> 
> >Protection against reinfection cannot be fully confirmed until there is proof that most people who encounter the virus a second time are actually able to keep it at bay, Dr. Pepper said. But the findings could help quell recent concerns over the virus’s ability to dupe the immune system into amnesia, leaving people vulnerable to repeat bouts of disease.
> 
> >Researchers have yet to find unambiguous evidence that coronavirus reinfections are occurring, especially within the few months that the virus has been rippling through the human population. The prospect of immune memory “helps to explain that,” Dr. Pepper said.
> Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak
> Updated 11h ago
> 
> >In discussions about immune responses to the coronavirus, much of the conversation has focused on antibodies — Y-shaped proteins that can latch onto the surfaces of pathogens and block them from infecting cells. But antibodies represent just one wing of a complex and coordinated squadron of immune soldiers, each with their own unique modes of attack. Viruses that have already invaded cells, for instance, are cloaked from antibodies, but are still vulnerable to killer T cells, which force infected cells to self-destruct. Another set of T cells, nicknamed “helpers,” can coax B cells to mature into antibody-making machines.
> 
> >(Yet another sector of the immune system assails pathogens within minutes of their arrival, while sending out signals called cytokines to mobilize forces from elsewhere in the body. Some evidence suggests that severe cases of Covid-19 may stem from this early process going awry.)
> 
> >Antibodies also come with an expiration date: Because they are inanimate proteins and not living cells, they can’t replenish themselves, and so disappear from the blood just weeks or months after they are produced. Hoards of antibodies appear shortly after a virus has breached the body’s barriers, then wane as the threat dissipates. Most of the B cells that produce these early antibodies die off as well.
> 
> >But even when not under siege, the body retains a battalion of longer-lived B cells that can churn out virus-fighting antibodies en masse, should they prove useful again. Some patrol the bloodstream, waiting to be triggered anew; others retreat into the bone marrow, generating small amounts of antibodies that are detectable years, sometimes decades, after an infection is over. Several studies, including those led by Dr. Bhattacharya and Dr. Pepper, have found antibodies capable of incapacitating the coronavirus lingering at low levels in the blood months after people have recovered from Covid-19.
> 
> >“The antibodies decline, but they settle in what looks like a stable nadir,” which is observable about three months after symptoms start, Dr. Bhattacharya said. “The response looks perfectly durable.”

## Belarus ambassador declares solidarity with opposition protesters

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belarus-protests-ambassador-alexander-lukashenko-nasha-niva-slovakia-a9672771.html):

> The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia has broken rank to declare solidarity with protesters in Belarus following the country's disputed presidential election. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, has faced down a week of street demonstrations and refused demands for a re-run of an election protesters say was massively rigged to disguise the fact that he has lost public support. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Mr Lukashenko's opposition rival in the contested election, has called for a huge "March of Freedom" through the centre of Minsk, the Belarusian capital, on Sunday morning.

## German vice chancellor calls Lukashenko a 'dictator'

> BERLIN - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz described Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Sunday as a dictator who had lost the support of his people and warned Moscow against intervening to keep him in power. "This is a bad dictator and therefore he needs clear statements and clear language," Scholz, who is also Germany's vice chancellor, told the Bild newspaper website in a live interview. "I am firmly convinced that this president no longer has any legitimacy, otherwise he would not rule with such unbelievable and brutal force," said Scholz, who is the Social Democrat candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.

## Belarus leader rejects calls to redo election, as mass protests continue

Summary of [original article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/belarus-leader-rejects-calls-to-redo-election-as-mass-protests-continue-2020-08-16):

> MINSK, Belarus - The embattled president of Belarus tried to put on a show of strength Sunday, holding a rally with tens of thousands of supporters and rejecting any possibility of repeating the vote that gave him a sixth term. "The result of the election is on the streets and squares of Belarus today - it's a sea of people who will never agree to live as before with Lukashenko," said Feliks Zharikov, an engineer who came with his wife and son. Although Russia and Belarus agreed in 1997 to a close union, Lukashenko frequently claims that his giant neighbor aims to absorb Belarus entirely.

## Thailand's largest pro-democracy rally in years draws 10,000

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/thailands-largest-pro-democracy-rally-in-years-draws-10000/a-54588173):

> An anti-government protest in Thailand's capital Bangkok drew at least 10,000 people on Sunday, police said, making it the largest political demonstration the kingdom has seen in years. The last demand is particularly sensitive in Thailand - anyone criticizing the monarchy faces between 1.5 to 15 years in jail. Thailand has experienced multiple coups ever since the army toppled the absolute monarchy in 1932, replacing it with a constitutional monarchy.
