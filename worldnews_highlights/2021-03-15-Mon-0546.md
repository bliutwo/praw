## Spain to launch trial of four-day working week

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/15/spain-to-launch-trial-of-four-day-working-week):

> Spain could become one of the first countries in the world to trial the four-day working week after the government agreed to launch a modest pilot project for companies interested in the idea. Tejero estimated that the pilot could get under way as early as autumn, ushering in the first national initiative to reduce working hours since France began moving towards capping the work week at 35 hours in 1998. What Más País is hoping to see is an echo of the experience of Software Delsol, the southern Spanish firm that last year became the first in the country to implement a four-day working week.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/at-least-39-reported-killed-in-myanmar-as-chinese-factories-burn-idUSKBN2B602C?il=0):

> 5 Min Read.(Reuters) - Security forces killed at least 22 anti-coup protesters in the poor, industrial Hlaingthaya suburb of Myanmar's main city on Sunday after Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze there, an advocacy group said. A further 16 protesters were killed in other places, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said, as well as one policeman, making it the bloodiest day since the Feb. 1 coup against elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Chinese embassy said many Chinese staff were injured and trapped in arson attacks by unidentified assailants on garment factories in Hlaingthaya and that it had called on Myanmar to protect Chinese property and citizens. "If you want to do business in Myanmar stably, then respect Myanmar people," she said.

`/u/green_flash` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/m535p0/at_least_39_reported_killed_in_myanmar_as_chinese/):

> Everyone is talking about the Chinese factories. 
> 
> Can we also acknowledge that the Tatmadaw have killed 39 protesters today, half of them in places with no connection to the burning of Chinese factories? That is making it the bloodiest day since the coup. Completely unacceptable regardless of what some of the protesters may have set on fire in Hlaingthaya Township.

## Another Mass school abduction foiled by security forces in Nigeria

Summary of [original article](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/africa/article/3125416/attempt-abduct-hundreds-schoolboys-foiled-security-forces-nigeria):

> Security forces have foiled an attempt to kidnap hundreds of schoolboys in northwestern Nigeria, a state official said on Sunday, days after dozens of students were seized in the latest mass abduction. The kidnapping of 39 students on Thursday was the most recent in a string of abductions complicating the security challenges facing President Muhammadu Buhari's security forces, who are also battling a more than decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast. "Fortunately, the students used the security warning system in place, and were thus able to alert security forces in the area", he said.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-politics-taiwan-int-idUSKBN2B70CQ):

> 2 Min Read.TAIPEI - Taiwan's de facto embassy in Myanmar has advised Taiwanese companies operating in the country to fly the island's flag and hang signs stating they are from Taiwan to avoid being confused with China, after Chinese-financed factories were set ablaze. Taiwanese firms in Southeast Asia have been confused for Chinese ones in protests before, including in 2014 when thousands of Vietnamese set fire to foreign factories in an angry reaction to Chinese oil drilling in a part of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam. China claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory.
