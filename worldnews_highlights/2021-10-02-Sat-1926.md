> “When we are in the European parliament for instance, we are not confronted with lobbies working for the Chinese government. When we want to take measures and pass legislation that will hurt Chinese interests, we are confronted with the representatives of European companies,” said Glucksman. “The strongest embassies for the Chinese Community Party today are the big European companies that have interests in China because China is essential for their production and essential as a market.”

> It’s a good move, but two points of concern. For some foods, especially imported food, the plastic packaging actually retains CO2 which extends the shelf live considerably- reducing food waste.
> 
> The other is the sheer amount of plastic used in the production of fresh vegetables in Spain (and elsewhere I imagine, I visit rural Spain frequently, and at a certain point in a crops harvest entire fields get tented in single use transparent plastic. Presumably to keep bugs and rodents out and create moist green house like conditions. They also dig plastic irrigation pipes into the soil which are the dug out on harvest and often just dumped at the side of the road.
> 
> Removing plastic wrapping will make consumers feel better about. Ourselves, but there is still a way to go and problems to be solved.
