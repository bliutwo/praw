## Scotland to be first country to have universal free period products

Summary of [original article](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scotland-be-first-country-have-universal-free-period-products-3045105):

> Scotland will become the first country in the world to introduce free universal access to period products if a new law is passed in Holyrood today, though the MSP behind the legislation has said it is just the first step in ending the "Stigma of menstruation" in Scottish society. "Scotland will not be the last country to make period poverty history - but it now has a chance to be the first. This law will ensure no one has to go without essential period products." "Thanks to a bold grassroots campaign and cross-party support, Scotland has already taken great strides to improve access to period products. Legislation is a world-leading opportunity to secure period dignity for all women, girls and people who menstruate."
