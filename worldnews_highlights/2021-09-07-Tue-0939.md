## 20 meat and dairy firms emit more greenhouse gas than Germany, Britain or France

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/07/20-meat-and-dairy-firms-emit-more-greenhouse-gas-than-germany-britain-or-france):

> Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France - and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so, according to a new report by environmental campaigners. Between 2015 and 2020, global meat and dairy companies received more than US$478bn in backing from 2,500 investment firms, banks, and pension funds, most of them based in North America or Europe, according to the Meat Atlas, which was compiled by Friends of the Earth and the European political foundation, Heinrich Böll Stiftung. Responding to the report, Paolo Patruno, deputy secretary general of the European Association for the Meat Processing Industry, said: "We don't believe that any food sector is more or less sustainable than another. But there are more or less sustainable ways to produce plant or animal foods and we are committed to making animal protein production more sustainable."We also know that average GHG emissions in the EU from livestock is half that of the global average.

> Much of the greenhouse gas emitted by meat and dairy farms is methane.
> 
> >Methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. Even though CO2 has a longer-lasting effect, methane sets the pace for warming in the near term. At least 25% of today's warming is driven by methane from human actions.

> Brazil is destroying the Amazon to make room for the meat and dairy industry.  Those industries consume a exorbitant amount of resources while also doing a wide variety of damage to the environment.
> 
> But people don't want to change.  They feel entitled to as much as they want whenever they want.  Anybody who talks about reducing consumption or ending it all together and it becomes an argument about their rights being infringed upon.  It's selfish.   People will continue to consume and until it is no longer sustainable and they have left untold damage for future generations to clean up.

## ProtonMail Shares Activist's IP Address With Authorities Despite Its "No Log" Claims

Summary of [original article](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/protonmail-shares-activists-ip-address.html):

> The Switzerland-based company said it received a "Legally binding order from the Swiss Federal Department of Justice" related to a collective called Youth for Climate, which it was "Obligated to comply with," compelling it to handover the IP address and information related to the type of device used by the group to access the ProtonMail account. "Proton must comply with Swiss law. As soon as a crime is committed, privacy protections can be suspended and we're required by Swiss law to answer requests from Swiss authorities," ProtonMail founder and CEO Andy Yen tweeted, adding "It's deplorable that legal tools for serious crimes are being used in this way. But by law, [ProtonMail] must comply with Swiss criminal investigations. This is obviously not done by default, but only if legally forced." Note - The headline of the article has been revised to reflect that ProtonMail can enable logging of IP addresses pursuant to Swiss court orders.

> 
> >Hi everyone, Proton team here. We are also deeply concerned about this case. In the interest of transparency, here's some more context.
> 
> >In this case, Proton received a legally binding order from the Swiss Federal Department of Justice which we are obligated to comply with. There was no possibility to appeal or fight this particular request because an act contrary to Swiss law did in fact take place (and this was also the final determination of the Federal Department of Justice which does a legal review of each case).
> 
> >Details about how we handle Swiss law enforcement requests can found in our transparency report: https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/
> 
> >Transparency with the user community is extremely important to us and we have been publishing a transparency report since 2015.
> 
> >As detailed in our transparency report, our published threat model, and also our privacy policy, under Swiss law, Proton can be forced to collect info on accounts belonging to users under Swiss criminal investigation. This is obviously not done by default, but only if Proton gets a legal order for a specific account. Under no circumstances however, can our encryption be bypassed, meaning emails, attachments, calendars, files, etc, cannot be compromised by legal orders.
> 
> >What does this mean for users?
> 
> >First, unlike other providers, ProtonMail does fight on behalf of users. Few people know this (it's in our transparency report), but we actually fought over 700 cases in 2020 alone, which is a huge amount. This particular case however could not be fought.
> 
> >Second, ProtonMail is one of the only email providers that provides a Tor onion site for anonymous access. This allows users to connect to ProtonMail through the Tor anonymity network. You can find more information here: protonmail.com/tor
> 
> >Third, no matter what service you use, unless it is based 15 miles offshore in international waters, the company will have to comply with the law. This case does illustrate one benefit of ProtonMail's Swiss jurisdiction, as no less than 3 authorities in 2 countries were required to approve the request, which is a much higher bar than most other jurisdictions. Under Swiss law, it is also obligatory for the suspect to be notified that their data was requested.
> 
> >The prosecution in this case seems quite aggressive. Unfortunately, this is a pattern we have increasingly seen in recent years around the world (for example in France where terror laws are inappropriately used). We will continue to campaign against such laws and abuses.

> It's fascinating how bad the CNN article is. People are raising all sorts of standard and reasonable objections, rightfully, but actually the researchers addressed many of these issues. So in other words the researchers weren't complete idiots. Here's a much better article with a a key quote:  
> 
> 
> *The study found cannabis users were also more likely to be male, smoke cigarettes, use e-cigarettes and be heavy alcohol drinkers, which may also contribute to their risk of heart attack.*  
> *But researchers said their analysis adjusted for those risk factors and others and the results were “still consistent.”*  
> *“We feel pretty confident that after (incorporating) all these different statistical techniques, this is indeed a real association that is present,” Ladha said.*  
>

## Iran condemns Taliban for assault on holdout fighters in Panjshir Valley

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-condemns-taliban-for-assault-on-holdout-fighters-in-panjshir-valley/):

> TEHRAN, Iran - Iran on Monday "Strongly" condemned the Taliban's military offensive against holdout fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, as the Islamist group claimed that it had taken control of the area. The Taliban on Monday claimed victory in the mountainous Panjshir area, with a spokesman declaring "Our country is completely taken out of the quagmire of war," three weeks after the Islamists captured the capital. "The Taliban must equally respect their obligations in terms of international law, and their commitments," he added, affirming that "Iran will work to put an end to all the suffering of the Afghan people in favor of establishing a representative government for all Afghans."

`/u/3rdOrderEffects` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/pjcjkw/iran_condemns_taliban_for_assault_on_holdout/):

> The most interesting thing about this is that Iran is literally the only country in the world who has issued a statement like this on the Panjshir conflict. Correct me if I'm wrong but no other country has made a statement like this. Not even Tajikistan
