> This tax doesn't include people who have tax residency abroad and have their property and wealth abroad, which is the majority of Argentina's wealthiest people. [Including the late Diego Maradona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3I0_2r67T0).
> 
> Argentina [*already has* a wealth tax](https://www.afip.gob.ar/gananciasYBienes/bienes-personales/conceptos-basicos/que-es.asp) for wealths in excess of ARS 3 million (USD 37000 using the official exchange rate, USD 20700 using the blue-chip rate), paying from 0.5% up to 1.25% of the total person's worth (not *net* worth: it doesn't take debts into account). 
> 
> I'm sure the sophomoric Reddit userbase will side with this tax regardless of how it was implemented because "tax the rich" is enough for them, but considering that this new wealth tax not only taxes illiquid assets but also doesn't take into account passives (debt incurred), this could end up being a disaster for businesses, even medium-size businesses: the lowest rate will require to pay ARS 4 million, which few people have *in cash*. They will have to liquidate assets, which will directly impact private investment at a time in which unemployment nears the record 25% rate of 2002.

The report, obtained Friday by NBC News, does not conclude that the directed energy was delivered intentionally, by a weapon, as some U.S. officials have long believed. The study examined four possibilities to explain the symptoms: Infection, chemicals, psychological factors and microwave energy.
