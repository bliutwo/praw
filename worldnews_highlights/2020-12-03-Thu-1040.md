> His appearance before the standing committee on national security comes two weeks after he released a scathing report on sexual harassment in the RCMP. Bastarache was tasked with independently assessing the claims made as part of the Merlo-Davidson settlement. "The level of violence and sexual assault that was reported was shocking. Indeed, over 130 claimants disclosed penetrative sexual assaults," Bastarache's report says. There are calls for an independent review following a report into sexual harassment within the RCMP. The report's author described the accounts as "Shocking" and as signs of "Systemic" problems with misogyny, racism and homophobia.

## Germany says it dealt with COVID-19 so well that some people doubted the virus' existence, and broke the rules. It just reported its highest daily death toll, at 487.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-handled-covid-19-well-people-dont-take-it-seriously-2020-12):

> Germany dealt with the first wave of COVID-19 so well that people questioned how serious the virus was, and even doubted its existence, the head of its public health agency said Thursday. As of Thursday morning, Germany had reported more than 1.1 million cases of COVID-19, according to RKI data. "I am sure that as more cases occur, as people see it among their acquaintances, and more people see how it is a serious illness that they don't want to catch, one with long-term consequences, then I think compliance will improve," Wieler said.

## Facebook to ban anti-vaxx conspiracy theories

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/covid-vaccine-facebook-conspiracy-ban-b1765703.html):

> The new rules come as a coronavirus vaccine becomes more likely in the coming days after Wednesday's Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine announcement. "This could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines. For example, we will remove false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn't on the official vaccine ingredient list", Facebook said in its announcement. It added that it will also remove conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines that we know today are false, such as that specific populations are being forced to test the vaccine against their will.

> 
> One of the first things he put out was something along the lines of (paraphrasing here): “Some of you have worked from home and are used to it.  Many of you haven’t. To all of you, I say this - develop a routine, set work hours for yourself, set regular breaks, and do not be afraid to shut your computer down when that time comes.  If anyone - ANYONE - gives you shit for it report it directly to me / the other executives on the call.”

## Japan enacts law to make coronavirus vaccines free to residents

Summary of [original article](https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japan-enacts-law-to-make-coronavirus-vaccines-free-to-residents):

> The Diet enacted a law Wednesday to cover the costs for residents to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as hopes grow for the early arrival of vaccines following recent reports of progress amid a resurgence of infections. The House of Councillors unanimously passed a bill to revise the current vaccination law after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to secure coronavirus vaccines for all the roughly 126 million residents of the country in the first half of next year. Although the revised law strongly recommends that people get inoculated, the government will allow individuals to refuse if the efficacy and safety of vaccines has not been proved sufficiently at the time of approval.
