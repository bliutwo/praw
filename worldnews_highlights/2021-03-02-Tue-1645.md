## Betting on death of petrol cars, Volvo to go all electric by 2030

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-volvo-electric-idUSKBN2AU0AU):

> "I am totally convinced there will be no customers who really want to stay with a petrol engine," Volvo Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson told reporters when asked about future demand for electric vehicles. Samuelsson said Volvo will include wireless upgrades and fixes for its new electric models - an approach pioneered by electric carmaker Tesla Inc.Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles. Last month, Ford Motor Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.And last November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said its models would be all electric by 2030.Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, auto employment is expected to shrink.
