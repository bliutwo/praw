## 'Havana syndrome'- like mystery illness affects Vienna US diplomats | BBC News

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57875322):

> The US government is investigating a series of health incidents in the Austrian capital Vienna involving its diplomats and other administration staff. More than 20 officials have reported symptoms similar to Havana Syndrome - a mystery brain illness - since President Joe Biden took office in January. A 2019 US academic study found "Brain abnormalities" in the diplomats who had fallen ill, but Cuba dismissed the report.

> If it's any kind of sonic or RF/microwave attack, then the US already knows exactly what is going on. There is no way they have just ignored all the problems of the last few years and not put in some monitoring equipment into their embassies. I suspect they have found nothing, which is why it's still a mystery.

## Mexico lifts ban on fishing in vaquita habitat, potentially dooming endangered porpoise

Summary of [original article](https://www.newsweek.com/mexico-lifts-ban-fishing-vaquita-habitat-potentially-dooming-endangered-porpoise-1610216):

> Much to conservationists' dismay, Mexico has lifted a wholesale ban on fishing in the northern Gulf of California, a policy change that could represent the beginning of the end for the world's rarest marine mammal. Endemic to the northern Gulf of California alone, the vaquita is a critically endangered species of porpoise that is known for its shy and retiring nature, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Like many other porpoises, as well as sharks and dolphins, the vaquita is vulnerable to entanglement in fishing nets, including the gill nets local fishermen deploy to harvest an endangered species of fish known as the totoaba.

`/u/Tll6` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/om8y1n/mexico_lifts_ban_on_fishing_in_vaquita_habitat/):

> Mexico’s handling of this species has been a joke. The fishing free zones aren’t enforced and are pretty much preserves in name only. I wrote a paper for grad school comparing the efforts of Mexico and New Zealand in saving and protecting their respective endangered cetaceans. New Zealand actually made an effort to protect their porpoises and their populations are recovering. Mexico has done close to nothing and the vaquita is doomed to extinction at this point

## Canada surpasses US in percentage of fully vaccinated against Covid-19

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-07-17-21/h_1fc3c40ee66f6d9bd216f266843c9687):

> "People who are immunocompromised should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines and to follow?current prevention measures?(including wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others?staying they don't live with, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces) to protect themselves against COVID-19 until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider," according to the CDC's website. The CDC did not go so far as to tell the millions of immunocompromised people in the US to get an additional shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, noting that "The safety, efficacy and benefit of additional doses for COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised persons continues to be evaluated." On Friday, the CDC said data suggest the response to the vaccines might be reduced for several groups, including organ transplant recipients, people who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, people who have certain blood cancers, and people receiving dialysis or taking certain medications that suppress the immune system.
