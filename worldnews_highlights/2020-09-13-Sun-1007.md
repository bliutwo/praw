## Stephen Fry, Mark Rylance and a former Archbishop of Canterbury are among 150 public figures to hit back at government moves to classify the climate protesters of Extinction Rebellion as an “organised crime group”.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/12/stephen-fry-and-mark-rylance-join-defence-of-climate-activists-extinction-rebellion):

> Stephen Fry, Mark Rylance and a former Archbishop of Canterbury are among 150 public figures to hit back at government moves to classify the climate protesters of Extinction Rebellion as an "Organised crime group". Starmer said: "The free press is the cornerstone of democracy and we must do all we can to protect it. Denying people the chance to read what they choose is wrong and does nothing to tackle climate change." And last week Guardian News and Media stated: "We fully support the right to protest - but we do not condone any action that restricts the public's right to access journalism and buy whichever newspaper they choose." Today's letter states: "Extinction Rebellion has helped push the government's failure to act on the climate and ecological emergency into the public eye. Whether or not we agree with their tactics or targets, by blocking printing presses and delaying newspaper distribution, they have connected the dots of a broken system. For the past 30 years, there's been a woeful lack of serious reporting on the climate and ecological emergency due to the billionaire owners' vested interests, and a lack of understanding from reporters, to editors to senior executives, about the severity and scale of the crisis. This has meant a terrifying delay on action to combat climate change."
