## Africa to be declared free of wild polio after decades of work

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/25/africa-to-be-declared-free-of-wild-polio-after-decades-of-work):

> Africa is expected to be declared free from wild polio, after decades of work by a coalition of international health bodies, national and local governments, community volunteers and survivors. Four years after the last recorded cases of wild polio in northern Nigeria, the Africa Regional Certification Commission is expected to certify that the continent is free of the virus, which can cause irreversible paralysis and in some cases death. Musbahu Lawan Didi, co-founder of Nigeria's Association of Polio Survivors, campaigning for the rights of those with polio , said: "It is incredible that what we have started years ago has built these results. As polio survivors we are the happiest and believe we'll be the last polio survivors in the country."

`/u/ping500` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ig6ofk/africa_to_be_declared_free_of_wild_polio_after/):

> Great news, polio might become a second (after smallpox) disease completely eradicated thanks to vaccines. From 1988 to 2018, number of recorded cases fallen from 350 000 to 33.  Out of 3 strains of polio, 2 are already extinct. Just a bit more and polio will be a history.

> EDIT: sorry, Rinderpest was the second.

## So much tear gas has been sprayed on Portland protesters that officials fear it's polluted the water

Summary of [original article](https://www.salon.com/2020/08/24/so-much-tear-gas-has-been-sprayed-on-portland-protesters-that-officials-fear-its-polluted-the-water/):

> The DEQ called for Portland officials to identify areas where stormwater containing tear gas might enter the Willamette River, which runs from Eugene to downtown Portland where it merges with the Columbia River and then flows out to the Pacific Ocean. The spokesperson also noted that there is likely tear gas residue already in the areas near the courthouse and Justice Center but that the city does not know very much about tear gas or tear gas residue. Reportedly, the type of tear gas used on Portland protesters - by both the police and, previously, unspecified federal law enforcement officers from the Department of Homeland Security sent in on orders from President Donald Trump - is a substance known as CS gas.

> Yeah, but trump wanted to DOMINATE the streets instead of addressing police reform.

## Bolt tests positive after mask-free birthday party

Summary of [original article](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/29735482/usain-bolt-tests-positive-coronavirus-self-isolating-home):

> 3:13 AM ET. World-record sprinter and eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt has tested positive for the coronavirus and is self-isolating at his home in Jamaica after celebrating his 34th birthday with a mask-free party last week. Jamaica's health ministry confirmed late Monday that Bolt, who holds world records in the 100-meter and 200-meter distance, tested positive after he posted a video on social media around midday saying that he was waiting on his results. "Best birthday ever," Bolt, who retired from athletics in 2017, wrote on Instagram with a photo of himself holding his daughter, Olympia, who was born in May. Fans wished Bolt a speedy recovery on social media - "Drink up your ginger tea," one wrote - though some accused him of carelessness.

`/u/seanular` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/igbcu0/bolt_tests_positive_after_maskfree_birthday_party/):

> Just a couple years past, on the track he was master.

## China hospitals aborted Uighur pregnancies, killed newborns: report

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-xinjiang-hospitals-abort-uighur-pregnancies-killed-newborns-report-2020-8):

> China hospitals aborted Uighur pregnancies, killed newborns: report - Business Insider Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'. It indicates a way to close an interaction, or dismiss a notification. Hospitals in Xinjiang aborted late-stage pregnancies and killed newborns as part of China's mission to erase Uighur culture, a former doctor from the region has told Radio Free Asia. "It's an order that's been given from above, it's an order that's been printed and distributed in official documents. Hospitals get fined if they don't comply, so of course they carry this out," she told RFA. The news follows a series of reports that demonstrate how China is forcibly sterilizing many Uighur women and fitting others with intrauterine devices to prevent pregnancy.
