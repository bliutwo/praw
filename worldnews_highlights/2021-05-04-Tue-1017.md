## Amazon had sales income of €44bn in Europe in 2020 but paid no corporation tax

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/04/amazon-sales-income-europe-corporation-tax-luxembourg):

> Fresh questions have been raised over Amazon's tax planning after its latest corporate filings in Luxembourg revealed that the company collected record sales income of €44bn in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy. The Luxembourg unit - which handles sales for the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden - employs just 5,262 staff meaning that the income per employ amounts to €8.4m.Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned against tax avoidance, said: "It seems that Amazon's relentless campaign of appalling tax avoidance continues."Amazon's revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle, yet it continues to shift its profits to tax havens like Luxembourg to avoid paying its fair share of tax. It said the group paid just $3.4bn in tax on its income so far this decade, despite achieving revenues of $961bn and profits of $26.8bn.The Fair Tax Foundation said this meant Amazon's effective tax rate was 12.7% over the decade when the headline tax rate in the US had been 35% for most of that period.

> Who's ultimately to blame, the scummy corporation that is infamous for doing whatever it can for profit or the system that does absolutely nothing to stop it? All these headlines should be "scummy Corp earned XXbil and paid no tax, XYZ government agency and the politicians responsible for it made sure the system worked that way. Btw; Greg earned €45k and paid 30% tax because he had no choice."

## Police in Colombia open fire on citizens protesting tax reforms, killing at least 19 people.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56983865):

> The United Nations' human rights office has accused Colombia's security forces of using excessive force against protesters. Even though President Iván Duque announced on Sunday that he would withdraw the tax reform, protests have continued in Colombia's major cities. The umbrella group which called for last week's protest has convened a fresh nationwide strike for Wednesday, saying that the withdrawal of the tax reform was not enough and that it also wants improvements to Colombia's pension, health and education systems.

`/u/Masterkid1230` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n4rp6l/police_in_colombia_open_fire_on_citizens/):

> Just before anyone gets confused, the 19 people were not killed in a single large mass shooting, but instead casualties all over the country during a week of protests nationwide.
> 
> This proves that our problem with police brutality is systemic, resulting in several similar instances of it, that the protests have been violent in many places, and that the entire country is pretty mad about the current government. 
> 
> But no, despite the title making it seem like it, it wasn’t a single incident and a huge massacre, but instead a spread out and systemic issue with police forces. More like Hong Kong and less like Tianmen square so you get an idea.

## Germany: Right-wing criminality at a record high | Violent and racist crimes are on the up in Germany, according to official statistics on politically-motivated crimes. Crimes by right-wing extremists hit their highest levels since records began in 2001.

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-right-wing-criminality-at-a-record-high/a-57421079):

> The majority of violent crimes which were classified as politically-motivated were perpetrated by right-wing extremists, with 13 victims of attempted violent crimes on top of the 11 who were killed in Hanau.

Despite the focus on right-wing extremism among the crime data and the threat it posed, Seehofer said the ministry would keep its eye on left-wing extremism, just as with Islamist extremism.

`/u/MineralsMan` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n4loet/germany_rightwing_criminality_at_a_record_high/):
