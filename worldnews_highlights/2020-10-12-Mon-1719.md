Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-holocaust-anti-semitism-hate-speech-rules-zuckerberg-b991216.html):

> Facebook has announced that it is updating its hate speech policies to explicitly ban Holocaust denial. "We've long taken down posts that praise hate crimes or mass murder, including the Holocaust. But with rising antisemitism, we're expanding our policy to prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust as well. If people search for the Holocaust on Facebook, we'll start directing you to authoritative sources to get accurate information," he wrote. Previously, Facebook had used Holocaust denial as an example of how the company protects free speech.

## Black hole seen eating star, causing 'disruption event' visible in telescopes around the world

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/black-hole-star-space-tidal-disruption-event-telescope-b988845.html?fbclid=IwAR3gQEKFMDyxmlVim9EraIl_PbwXyH_ys5_mgcjlb4k34tSUajBHHQElwg4):

> Scientists have watched a rare blast of light from a star as it was eaten by a black hole. As the star is sucked in, it undergoes a process called "Spaghettification", where the star is shredded into thin strips, some of which falls into the black hole. "The idea of a black hole 'sucking in' a nearby star sounds like science fiction. But this is exactly what happens in a tidal disruption event," said lead author Dr Matt Nicholl, a lecturer and Royal Astronomical Society research fellow at the University of Birmingham.

## France doubles paid paternity leave to 28 days

Summary of [original article](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/france-doubles-paid-paternity-leave):

> The French government announced on September 22 that paid paternity leave will be extended to 28 days.

`/u/QueryThePlatypus` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/j9pbhp/france_doubles_paid_paternity_leave_to_28_days/):

> 
> Right now America guarantees 0 days of paid paternity leave; and 0 days of paid maternity leave. But it's cool because we have badass tanks and fighter jets, because priorities.
