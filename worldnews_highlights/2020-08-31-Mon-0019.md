Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/30/rampant-destruction-of-forests-will-unleash-more-pandemics):

> Scientists are to warn world leaders that increasing numbers of deadly new pandemics will afflict the planet if levels of deforestation and biodiversity loss continue at their current catastrophic rates. A UN summit on biodiversity, scheduled to be held in New York next month, will be told by conservationists and biologists there is now clear evidence of a strong link between environmental destruction and the increased emergence of deadly new diseases such as Covid-19.Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of farming and the building of mines in remote regions - as well as the exploitation of wild animals as sources of food, traditional medicines and exotic pets - are creating a "Perfect storm" for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people, delegates will be told. The virus is spread by the rodent Mastomys natalensis, which was widespread in Africa's savannahs and forests but now colonises homes and farms, passing on the disease to humans.
