The 30-year-old man arrested in Wyong on the Central Coast in February, Justin Radford, is accused of 89 offences, including 10 counts of sexual touching of a victim under 10, 12 counts of producing child abuse material and 22 counts of disseminating abuse material. NSW Police Child Abuse and Sex Crimes Squad Commander, Detective Acting Superintendent Chris Goddard, said specialist police from different agencies were targeting child exploitation across the country.

> Why is Bolsonaro opposed to a vaccine, even if the company developing the vaccine is promoted by a political foe? Or am I misreading the article? It seems like there is no logical reason to oppose a vaccine rollout, unless your sole motive in the crisis is to spread the virus and death. Less deaths would make him look good, regardless of the company that produced the vaccine.

> 
> That's a pretty hefty fine.  I hope they go for the maximum.

> "The country's femicide crisis"
> 
> I don't want to be that guy but marital rape was only made a crime in Mexico in 2003, and is rarely enforced because Judges outside the cities refuse to allow women to speak without a male sponsor (usually their husband, father, brother or priest) to speak for them. And just to be clear, Mexican women like men have no right to bear arms and no right to self defense either so if a woman stops her murder with firearm she's put in jail for life for murder. 
> 
> This isn't Poland or the US where people have a right to free speech in the first place. Mexicans do not have that right. They don't even have a right to a timely trial, a jury trial, a trial, or presumption of innocence. If they are arrested they can be freely sent to a detention camp and forgotten about until they agree to move drugs for narcos that post their bail. Which is why most people in Mexico just ignore the law because the law is completely useless for them.

> Crazy how people expect this violence as “just another day in Mexico” but turn around in the same breath and say “shouldn’t have come here” when they read articles about children being separated from their parents at the border. The cognitive dissonance is incredible. These people are running away just to survive.
