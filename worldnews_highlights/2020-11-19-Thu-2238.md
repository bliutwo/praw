## Mexican Senate Committees Formally Approve Marijuana Legalization Bill For Full Floor Action

Summary of [original article](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/mexican-senate-committees-formally-approve-marijuana-legalization-bill-for-full-floor-action/):

> In a new memoir looking back at his time in office, former President Barack Obama writes that a decision early in his first term to cut deals with congressional Republicans allowed him to ignore some Democrats' calls for "Less orthodox ideas" such as marijuana legalization. Though candidate Obama had said medical marijuana legalization was a question best left to the states, his administration in 2011 launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries in legal jurisdictions such as California. In November 2016, after the election of Donald Trump as his successor, Obama told Rolling Stone that it wasn't his place to change the nation's marijuana policy through an executive action.

> That was yesterday. Senate just voted for it in the full floor seconds ago, now they'll have to discuss some points some Senators disagreed with, and when that is done, it goes to the lower chamber and then the executive. 
> 
> The executive might be the hardest part, because the President said he's against, but he said he would let the legislative decide too.
> 
> Edit: It was just approved in the Senate in general and with reservations, so the next step is the lower chamber, which should be happening in the next few days.

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55001167):

> EPA. French President Emmanuel Macron has asked Muslim leaders to accept a "Charter of republican values" as part of a broad clampdown on radical Islam. Mr Macron has strongly defended French secularism in the wake of the attacks, which included the beheading of a teacher who showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class discussion last month. Following these comments, the French leader became a figure of hate in several Muslim-majority countries.

## CBD is not a narcotic, says EU court as it rules French ban is illegal

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/19/cbd-is-not-a-narcotic-says-eu-court-french-ban):

> The cannabis-derived compound CBD is not a narcotic drug because "It does not appear to have any psychotropic effect or any harmful effect on human health", the EU's highest court has ruled. The decision by the court of justice of the European Union deals a severe blow to efforts by some EU countries to limit the sale of CBD, while simultaneously giving the CBD industry a boost. The court ruled that the French ban on the marketing of hemp-derived CBD products contradicted EU law on the free movement of goods.

## Canada in talks to donate extra COVID-19 vaccine shots to poorer countries - Canada, has reserved enough doses to vaccinate residents several times over, is in talks with other governments about a plan to donate shots to lower-income countries, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-covax-exc/exclusive-canada-in-talks-to-donate-extra-covid-19-vaccine-shots-to-poorer-countries-sources-idUSKBN27Y2UU):

> Canada could donate extra doses through the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility, which would distribute them among recipient countries, said a Canadian government source. If rich countries do not close that funding gap, and then wait until most of their own residents are vaccinated before sharing doses, millions of frontline workers and vulnerable people in poorer countries could face a long wait for vaccination. A recent vaccine modeling report from the Center for Global Development estimated that there would not be enough doses to vaccinate everyone until 2023.Canada, with a population of about 38 million, has ordered up to 414 million vaccine doses through seven purchase agreements.

## Trudeau defends arrest of Huawei executive, says countries must stand up to China

Summary of [original article](https://thinkpol.ca/2020/11/19/trudeau-defends-arrest-of-huawei-executive-says-countries-must-stand-up-to-china/):

> OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is defending the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities, saying Canada can't pick and choose when it follows the rule of law. The prime minister says other countries must stand up to China to ensure it also follows international rules and stops trying to throw its weight around to get what it wants. Rather, he said national leaders need to better understand the many fears and anxieties gripping everyday people around the world, which includes ensuring free trade and globalization benefit those people while addressing climate change.

`/u/angelcake` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jx69em/trudeau_defends_arrest_of_huawei_executive_says/):

> We had no choice. We are bound by extradition treaties.  I truly do not know why people are still going on about this. Sending her home would be giving in to dictator. 
> 
> What we really need is for Canadians to show some common sense and not go to China. They are sitting ducks right now as those poor men who are still in prison over there no full well. I am all for dumping the Huawei princess in jail until extradition is decided. We tried to be decent now it’s time to be the asshole.

## Queen Elizabeth and husband Philip celebrate 73rd wedding anniversary

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-royals-anniversary-idUSKBN27Z369):

> 2 Min Read.LONDON - Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip celebrate their 73rd wedding anniversary on Friday, an occasion they will be unable to share with their family as England is currently under a coronavirus lockdown. While royal watchers say Elizabeth and Philip have had their ups and downs like any married couple, they have avoided the travails of three of their four children whose marriages have ended in divorce, most notably their oldest son Prince Charles's ill-fated union with his late first wife Princess Diana. "He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years," Elizabeth said when the couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.
