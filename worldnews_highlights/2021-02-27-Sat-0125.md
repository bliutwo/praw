## U.S. diplomats forced by China to undergo anal swab testing for Covid-19 after Biden raised "fundamental concerns" about Beijing's "coercive and unfair economic practices and human rights abuses in Xinjiang."

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-diplomats-china-subjected-anal-swab-testing-covid-19-n1258844):

> U.S. diplomats in China were subjected to anal swab tests for Covid-19, a Department of State spokesperson confirmed Thursday, adding that a protest had been lodged with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The story was first reported by The Washington Post.However, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a news conference Thursday that he had checked with his colleagues and as far as he knew, "China has never asked U.S. diplomats stationed in China to have anal swab tests." Some health experts say the anal swab tests are more accurate than nasal and mouth swabs to detect virus traces.

Biden's review of relations with Saudi Arabia is part of a broader U.S. foreign policy shift in the Middle East.The president has ended U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen while seeking to return to the negotiating table with Iran, Riyadh's enemy, over its nuclear program.

Prigozhin said the FBI was using him as a scapegoat for the United States' internal crises by seeking his arrest.

## Taiwan urges people to eat more pineapples after China bans imports amid campaign of 'intimidation'

Summary of [original article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-27/china-bans-taiwan-pineapple-imports-independence-intimidation/13199504):

> Taiwan normally exports 90 per cent of its pineapples to China. Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has carried out repeated air missions in the south-western corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone in recent months. Taiwan's air force scrambled for a second straight day last weekend after a dozen Chinese fighter aircraft and bombers carried out drills close to Taiwan-controlled islands in the disputed South China Sea.Asked at a news briefing last month about the air forces' recent activities, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said Taiwan was an inseparable part of China.

> **SS:** Currently, Russia's 9K720 Iskander missile system is embroiled in controversy over its effectiveness, as [Armenian PM declares them "useless".](https://jamestown.org/program/russias-iskander-missiles-fail-in-karabakh-but-cause-crisis-in-armenia/) While his words must hold *some* weight as the effective Commander in Chief of the Armenian military, there is some controversy within that controversy - Armenian leadership is desperate to scapegoat their loss in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War on anything they can portray as out of their control, including foreign weapons systems. Russia, meanwhile, faces claims that many of their weapons platforms - most notably their Pantsir S1 anti-air system, facing disaster in both [Libya](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2020/06/19/libya_a_catastrophe_for_russias_pantsir_s1_air_defense_system_115394.html) and [Syria](https://www.defenseworld.net/news/27161/Some_23_Russian_Pantsir_Air_Defense_Systems_Destroyed_in_Syria__Libya__Reports) - are dramatically underperforming.
> 
> The Russian MOD stepped into this controversy to denounce the PM's claims, and, in an effort to prove the Iskander missile system is effective, released footage of their use in Syria. The footage contains multiple launches, all fired from the Hmemymim Airbase, and also shows where the missiles hit.
> 
> This footage included an attack on an Aleppo civilian hospital that Russia has long denied.
> 
> [Google satellite imagery of the Azaz National Hospital](https://www.thenationalnews.com/image/policy:1.1173815:1614348583/wo27-Russia-bombs-hospital.JPG?f=16x9&w=1200&$p$f$w=5efbcb0) clearly matches up visually with the building struck in this video. A geolocation savant named "Samers" later [geolocated the strike in the video and confirmed it was a strike on the hospital.](https://twitter.com/obretix/status/1364986455383281667)
> 
> Satellite evidence of the strike on Azaz National Hospital became publicly available in March, 2016. Other missile attacks in Azaz were reported around that time, including [one on a children's hospital and a school on 2/15/2016.](https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-missiles-idUSL8N15U1OM) Those strikes killed 14+ civilians [(in other reports, over 50)](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/azaz-hospital-air-raid-no-terrorists-no-fighters-just-babies) and, based on this context, are very likely also Russian attacks. This timeframe matches construction of a launch apron at Hmemymim Airbase seen in publicly-available satellite imagery beginning in early February, 2016.
> 
> This attack comes amid controversy over the New York Times report that combined flight path data, cockpit voice recordings, strike footage, and more to conclusively prove Russia bombed [four Syrian civilian hospitals in a single 12-hour period](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) in 2019. Among *many* other accusations of similar attacks on critical civilian infrastructure in Syria.
> 
> Basically, the Russian MOD posted a potential war crime in order to prove their Iskander missile system works.
