> I'm not british, but a lot of british people I follow are saying they know the racial makeup of these 40 people even though it hasn't been officially revealed. Apparently many many other similar child sex rings have been busted over the years and politicians refuse to acknowledge it because of the sex rings' usual racial makeup.

The same figure for China was 0.04.But daily cases in China are now at their highest since January, when tens of millions of people were placed under lockdowns as authorities battled to suppress cases centered around Hebei province.

## Earth Overshoot Day moves forward by nearly a month

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/earth-overshoot-day-moves-forward-by-nearly-a-month/a-58612967):

> "With almost half a year remaining, we will already have used up our quota of the Earth's biological resources for 2021," said Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council, where world leaders will gather later this year for the COP26 climate summit in November. Reforesting an area the size of India, for example, would shift the date back by eight days, according to GFN. Retrofitting buildings and industries with existing energy-saving technology, such as mechanical system upgrades, water conservation controls and sensors that accurately control lighting, temperature and air quality, would move the date back by 21 days. Shifting to more plant-based diets, for example, could help reduce food-related emissions as much as 70% by 2050, according to a recent draft report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

`/u/Maesica` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ov2bst/earth_overshoot_day_moves_forward_by_nearly_a/):

> Whenever people hear the word 'unsustainable', I am convinced that 99% of them simply don't know what the word actually means.
