> The gay Indian Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, is the latest voice to join calls to see laws that ban conversion therapy. The fight against LGBT conversion therapy is fast becoming a global focal point for countries that have achieved LGBT anti-discrimination, equal marriage and adoption rights. A vast majority in the EU parliament called on all member states to ban conversion therapy in March 2018, but so far only Germany has made moves to ban the practice.

## Animals were subjected to a string of brutal attacks at a farm that sells goats’ milk to Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and other supermarkets, footage from hidden cameras has revealed. Goats were seen on video being punched, kicked, hit with a pole and slammed onto their backs at a plant.

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/goats-milk-st-helens-farm-yoghurt-hit-kick-animal-cruelty-video-a9639021.html):

> Animals were subjected to a string of brutal attacks at a farm that sells goats' milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and other supermarkets, footage from hidden cameras has revealed. Goat milk, yoghurts, cheese and ice cream sold by the St Helen's Farm brand are the best-known goat milk products in the UK and are stocked by major supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Ocado. "St Helen's say on their website the milk is a reward for looking after the goats and that their staff have a genuine interest and love for the animals. But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms."

## German study finds 76% of patients previously infected with coronavirus experience lasting cardiac injuries similar to those found after a heart attack

Summary of [original article](https://www.boston.com/news/health/2020/07/27/coronavirus-heart/amp):

> More than two months later, infected patients were more likely to have troubling cardiac signs than people in the control group: 78 patients showed structural changes to their hearts, 76 had evidence of a biomarker signaling cardiac injury typically found after a heart attack, and 60 had signs of inflammation. "The fact that 78% of 'recovered' [patients] had evidence of ongoing heart involvement means that the heart is involved in a majority of patients, even if Covid-19 illness does not scream out with the classical heart symptoms, such as anginal chest pain," she told STAT. She is a cardiologist at University Hospital Frankfurt. Taken together, the two studies, published Monday in JAMA Cardiology, suggest that in many patients, Covid-19 could presage heart failure, a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body declines.

> > Taken together, the two studies, published Monday in JAMA Cardiology, suggest that in many patients, Covid-19 could presage heart failure, a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body declines. It is too soon to say if the damage in patients recovering from Covid-19 is transient or permanent, but cardiologists are worried.
> 
> Wow, the health implications for the general public could be enormous if the changes are permanent.

## Trained dogs were able to sniff out Covid-19 infections with 94% accuracy: study

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/07/24/trained-dogs-sniffed-out-covid-19-infections-with-high-accuracy-study.html?__twitter_impression=true):

> A new study, which was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, the Hannover Medical School and the German Armed Forces found that, if properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV-2 and non-infected samples with a 94% success rate overall. To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germany's Armed Forces for one week. While more research is still needed, Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to differentiate Covid-19 samples from other diseases like influenza.
