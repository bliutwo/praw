## We visited "Bitcoin Beach" to See How Bitcoin Works in El Salvador. AMA!

Summary of [original article](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/of24zi/we_visited_bitcoin_beach_to_see_how_bitcoin_works/):

> Vice News reporter Keegan Hamilton and Motherboard editor Jason Koebler are here to answer your questions about how Bitcoin is being used in El Salvador. ICYMI: El Salvador is the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. It all started with a tiny surf town called El Zonte that rebranded itself "Bitcoin Beach," installed a Bitcoin ATM, and created a way for locals to do everything from buy pupusas to pay their utility bills with Bitcoin.

> I hope he'll survive this attack, but it sounds very grim.

## Modi named among 37 ‘Predators of Press Freedom’ by Reporters Without Borders

Summary of [original article](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/modi-named-among-37-predators-of-press-freedom-by-reporters-without-borders):

> The organisation noted that since the PM is on close terms with these media-owners, the journalists are aware of the risk of criticising the government, and anyway, Modi's 'extremely divisive and derogatory speeches' help the media houses 'achieve record audience levels'. Modi has an online army of trolls or 'yodha', who wage online hate wars against journalists. The organisation thinks that 'all that is left for Modi is to neutralise the media outlets and journalists that question his divisive methods'.

`/u/schmurg` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/oevjw2/modi_named_among_37_predators_of_press_freedom_by/):

> Had a look at the list of 37, was a bit surprised to see Australia's Scott Morrison missing, despite sending the Australian Federal Police to raid the national news headquarters and journalist's homes.
