## EU bans plastic waste exports to poor nations. Under new rules, trash importers and exporters will need to agree on how to handle hazardous shipments.

Summary of [original article](https://m.dw.com/en/eu-bans-plastic-waste-exports-to-poor-nations/a-56033900):

> EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said the new rules amending the bloc's 2006 Waste Shipment Regulation will completely ban exports of unsorted plastics to less industrialized nations outside the OECD. The moves follow China's 2018 ban on plastic imports and statements from environmentalists that waste was ending up in other Asian nations, such as Malaysia, and then being dumped into ocean waters. Sinkevicius, a former Lithuanian economy minister, said even inside the 37-nation Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development any EU exports of hazardous plastic waste deemed "Hard to recycle" would require prior authorization from both the recipient and dispatching nation. Images of plastic waste on beaches and afloat in seas have publicly highlighted a global plastic glut since the last century,according to the convention's Geneva secretariat.
