## London ambulances ‘can no longer guarantee’ response to home-birth emergencies' ‘Critical that this information is communicated to [pregnant] women, to inform their planning and future choices,’ says London Ambulance Service NHS Trust

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-london-homebirth-cases-ambulance-b1778881.html):

> Women planning home births in London will no longer be guaranteed an ambulance response in the case of emergency, as a result of "Current pressures" from Covid-19, a local health authority has warned. In an email circulated on Christmas Eve and seen by The Independent, London Ambulance Service NHS Trust warned that it was "No longer in a position" to ensure a response is provided to those women choosing to have their birth at home or within one of the capital's three birthing centres. At the beginning of the pandemic, a number of trusts across the UK suspended home births, insisting that it was safer to attend hospital instead. Experts urged caution over home births, saying that while they may seem a logical option in the climate of social distancing, they can require additional resources and are not suitable for women who may have the coronavirus.

## France finds first case of new coronavirus variant

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55449528):

> France has confirmed the first case in the country of the more contagious coronavirus variant recently identified in the UK. The French health ministry said the person was a Frenchman in the town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December.

## Food scraps for cleaners: Internal emails from the company that has a multimillion-dollar contract to clean Melbourne’s tram network suggest that cleaning standards were impossible to maintain while staff were underpaid and worked so hard they were put at risk of injury.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/food-scraps-for-cleaners-yarra-trams-contractor-accused-of-underpayments-20201222-p56pjd.html):

> The emails, sent by the cleaning company's own senior managers, come as Yarra Trams staff reported that a cleaner working for the contractor had been seen collecting food scraps from a tram for several weeks so they could eat. The Age has confirmed that the Fair Work Ombudsman is making inquiries in relation to the cleaning contractor, GJK Facility Services, while Yarra Trams has also launched an independent investigation into the company in the wake of allegations about poor cleaning practices. In early 2019, staff members raised separate complaints about shortcuts taken on cleaning, with one tram stop that was supposed to be cleaned daily going uncleaned for months, parts of depots being cleaned only sporadically and trams not being cleaned daily for several weeks.
