## 'UN actively passing names of Uighur dissidents to Chinese regime:' whistleblower

Summary of [original article](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/1604309404-un-actively-passing-names-of-uighur-dissidents-to-chinese-regime-whistleblower):

> Human rights lawyer interviewed on British radio station said 'her boss' was the one passing on names to CCP. A human rights lawyer working for the United Nations in Geneva has accused the body's Human Rights Council of actively passing names of Uighur dissidents to the Chinese Communist Party. In a recently-released letter, UN Watch, an NGO that highlights UN malpractice and bias, revealed that as long ago as February 2017 - although the practice has allegedly gone on since 2013 - "Chinese authorities, and others, regularly ask the UN Human Rights Office whether particular NGO delegates are attending future sessions." "The United Nations is handing over the names of genocided Uighur dissidents... to the government of China that is genociding them?" he asked incredulously.

## Poland delays abortion ban amid nationwide protests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/03/poland-stalls-abortion-ban-amid-nationwide-protests):

> Poland's rightwing government has delayed the publication and implementation of a high court ruling that tightens the abortion law and has triggered almost two weeks of nationwide protests. The constitutional court ruled last month that aborting foetuses with congenital defects violated the constitution, in effect further tightening what was already one of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws. The president, Andrzej Duda, who is aligned with the government, has proposed a new law that would allow abortion of foetuses with life-threatening defects but ban them for disorders such as Down's syndrome.
