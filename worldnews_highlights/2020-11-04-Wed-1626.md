## ‘We were ordered to slaughter every Armenian in the village’, captured Syrian mercenary says

Summary of [original article](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1033852.html):

> 'We were ordered to slaughter every Armenian in the village', captured Syrian mercenary says. He said he was ordered not to take anything with him, including ID. The mercenary says he was then transported from the village of Ziyadiya to the Bab al Salam checkpoint, which is located in Syrian territory controlled by Abu Hamsha. "He told us we should slaughter, kill all Armenians, and meanwhile the Turkish and Azerbaijani servicemen were also coming and ordering us to kill and slaughter each and every Armenian. Abu Hamsha, as well as the Turkish and Azerbaijani servicemen, were telling us that each of us would receive an extra 100 dollars for beheading an Armenian. They also armed us with long knives. Those of us who were afraid were given some special drugs by the Azeri military, and they stopped feeling fear after taking them. I have personally witnessed how the Azerbaijani armed forces servicemen were giving the drugs to our Syrian guys, the drugs were round tablets, I haven't tried it myself, but many of our guys did," the Syrian mercenary said.

`/u/Myperspective__` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jo4jp9/we_were_ordered_to_slaughter_every_armenian_in/):

> Turkey is a shame to the world. Not only it doesn't recognize Armenian Genocide ( almost all european countries recognized it) , but does it again...
> Even if mostly Turkey's Erdogan is to blame, 50% is the turkish people, they deny it.

## U.S. Officially Leaving Paris Climate Agreement

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/03/930312701/u-s-officially-leaving-paris-climate-agreement):

> U.S. Leaving Paris Climate Agreement The United States is the only country to back out of its promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The American departure from the Paris Agreement also means the end of U.S. contributions to a global fund to help smaller and poorer countries that bear disproportionate costs of climate change. Fuller says, the U.S. was expected to help fund a major climate project in the Caribbean that would install weather stations, map the topography of the seafloor to predict storm surge better and help Caribbean nations use that data to become more resilient to the impact of climate change.

`/u/moshittyinbred` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jnrl11/us_officially_leaving_paris_climate_agreement/):

> People in the Gulf region could be the first climate change refugees in America. If hurricane season continues to be this way yearly, this area will not be liveable. If we don't get climate change under control, a lot of this country is going to be unliveable.

## ‘Keep calm and count on’ Experts say the election was never going to be decided on Nov. 3, but that’s normal and good

Summary of [original article](https://www.wmnf.org/keep-calm-and-count-on-experts-say-the-election-was-never-going-to-be-decided-on-nov-3-but-thats-normal-and-good/):

> Experts are urging Americans to remain calm as votes in crucial states continue to be counted in a heavily contested presidential election. Trump has repeated the false accusation that anything other than a clear victory on Nov. 3 would mean fraud, but elections, especially close ones, are never decided on Election Day. Smith noted there's no law, on a state or federal level that requires states to complete counting on Election Day.

`/u/Spork_Facepunch` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jo7h0j/keep_calm_and_count_on_experts_say_the_election/):

> Yeah, it's only in cases where the gap is large that it's "called" on election day.
> 
> Many people do not understand that "calling" an election is like the announcers in the stand saying what they think was the result of the play in a sporting event. It's completely unofficial. The "certified" results are the ones from the state election board and may take some time to be tabulated. They have to look at how many votes are received vs those that are still outstanding. If there are not enough uncounted votes to change the result,  a victory may be declared, but in close races it might take a little while.
> 
> In 2000 it took weeks to get an official winner. I know that isn't what anyone wants to hear right now (including myself)  but that's how it works. A lack of results on election day is absolutely not indicative of shenanigans, its just how our system works, and a byproduct of having 51 sets of election laws.

## Covid patients in North Korea are being left to starve to death in quarantine camps

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8908585/North-Korean-Covid-patients-left-starve-death-quarantine-camps.html):

> Covid patients in North Korea are being placed in 'quarantine camps' and left to starve to death, an activist has claimed. Peters, whose NGO delivers medical and other supplies to North Korea, described the Covid situation in the country as 'gravely serious'. Refugees who have fled North Korea but kept in contact with relatives still in the country have reported cases of people with symptoms 'being forced into isolation, or being boarded up in their homes without food or other support and left to die', according to pastor David Lee.Lee, who works with North Korean defectors in Seoul, said coronavirus is called the 'ghost disease' by North Koreans and there are no 'proper testing kits' to track or stop the spread of the virus.
