## Mercedes-Benz fined $1.5 billion for emissions cheating

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mercedes-benz-daimler-emissions-cheating-1-5-billion-fine/):

> Automaker Daimler AG and subsidiary Mercedes-Benz USA have agreed to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve allegations they cheated on emissions tests, officials said Monday. Daimler AG didn't make it clear just how the vehicles would be cleaned up or whether it was accused of any wrongdoing like Volkswagen, which paid $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case that arose from cheating on emissions tests. Steve Berman, a Seattle attorney who sued Daimler over Mercedes diesel pollution, said in 2016 his firm hired a company to test Mercedes diesels on real roads, finding that they spewed out too much nitrogen oxide almost all the time.

> Didn't they learn from Volkswagen's mistakes? Volkswagen also cheated an emission test and paid fine, right?

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-sentencing-netanyahus-son-tweets-in-support-of-duma-killer/#gs.flz56f):

> Hours after Amiram Ben Uliel received three life sentences plus 20 years on Monday for the 2015 murder of three, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son Yair criticized the conviction and retweeted a link to a crowdfunding page for his continued legal battle. Yair Netanyahu retweeted a link to "Honenu," a far-right legal aid group that offers support to what they call "Soldiers and civilians who find themselves in legal entanglements, due to defending themselves against Arab aggression, or due to their love for Israel." Yair Netanyahu is accompanying his father on the trip to the US. Yair Netanyahu responded by saying that the conviction was disgraceful and lacking in evidence.
