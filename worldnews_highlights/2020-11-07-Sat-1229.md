## Bolsonaro abandons 'friend' Τrump after 2020 election, says he's 'not the most important person in the world'

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/bolsonaro-trump-not-most-important-person-world-after-2020-election-2020-11):

> Bolsonaro said Trump is "Not the most important person in the world," the Washington Post reported. Bolsonaro has frequently echoed Trump's rhetoric as well, attacking the media as "Fake news." Trump once said that he was "Very proud" to hear Bolsonaro use the phrase. On Friday, president-elect Joe Biden was declared the projected winner of the 2020 election by Insider and Decision Desk HQ. Most other major news outlets appear to be on the cusp of declaring Biden the winner given his leads over Trump in key battleground states, and current and former world leaders as well as top diplomats have begun to react.

> "German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas criticized Trump's obstinance on the matter.  "Anyone who continues to pour oil on the fire in a situation like this is acting irresponsibly," Maas told Germany's Funke media group. "**Decent losers are more important for the functioning of a democracy than radiant winners."**"

> Bolsanaro could never say anything as compelling.

## UAE announces relaxing of Islamic laws for personal freedoms - The United Arab Emirates announced on Saturday a major overhaul of the country’s Islamic personal laws, allowing unmarried couples to cohabitate, loosening alcohol restrictions and criminalizing so-called “honor killings.”

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/dubai-united-arab-emirates-honor-killings-travel-islam-bce74c423897dc77c7beb72e4f51a23a):

> DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The United Arab Emirates announced on Saturday a major overhaul of the country's Islamic personal laws, allowing unmarried couples to cohabitate, loosening alcohol restrictions and criminalizing so-called "Honor killings." The broadening of personal freedoms reflects the changing profile of a country that has sought to bill itself as a Westernized destination for tourists, fortune-seekers and businesses despite its Islamic legal code that has previously triggered court cases against foreigners and outrage in their home countries. ADVERTISEMENT.In a country where expatriates outnumber citizens nearly nine to one, the amendments will permit foreigners to avoid Islamic Shariah courts on issues like marriage, divorce and inheritance.
