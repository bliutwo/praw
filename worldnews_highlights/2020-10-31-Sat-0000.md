## Thousands in Warsaw join biggest protest so far against abortion ruling

Summary of [original article](https://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKKBN27F138):

> 4 Min Read.WARSAW - Tens of thousands of Poles joined a march in Warsaw on Friday, the biggest in nine days of protests against a ruling by the country's top court last week that amounted to a near-total ban on abortion in the predominantly Catholic nation. Defying strict rules that restrict gatherings to five people during the coronavirus pandemic, demonstrators walked through central Warsaw streets carrying black umbrellas, a symbol of abortion rights protests in Poland, and banners that read "I think, I feel, I decide" or "God is a woman". Organisers and the city of Warsaw said some 100,000 people took part, one of the largest protest gatherings in years, following a Constitutional Court ruling on Oct. 22 outlawing abortions due to foetal defects.

> Forced pregnancy is slavery. The church cannot demand that government enforce its beliefs on others by denying human rights.

> My best mate is currently suffering with COVID. He woke up this morning to angry messages from people he had been in contact with prior to his positive test. One even asked if he’d leave them off the form so they could carry on about their life in blissful ignorance.

For education, the autumn holidays will be extended even further: schools will remain closed until 15 November. For primary schools, all pupils will have to go back to class after that.

## Mum who joked with colleagues about catching Covid twice tests positive for 2nd time

Summary of [original article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-admits-getting-complacent-after-22933740):

> Fiona, who works at a secondary school, first realised something wasn't right when she began to feel drained and tired back in May. She said: "Last time I was absolutely exhausted all the time. I had zero energy whatsoever." After returning to work, Fiona admitted that she felt slightly invincible, even joking with colleagues that she couldn't catch it again. "Because the cough was so bad and I had the conversation at work with friends about getting it twice I thought I would go and get a test."

## Eat Out To Help Out Scheme ‘Increased Coronavirus Infections By Up To 17%’ in UK

> The Eat Out To Help Out scheme, which saw individuals and families encouraged to eat out at discounted rates following the national lockdown, caused a "Significant" increase in Covid-19 cases, a study has claimed. The Warwick University research suggests that the scheme may be responsible for between 8 and 17% of all new detected clusters of coronavirus emerging during August and into early September in the UK. Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the scheme of subsidised meals to help the pub and restaurant sector after it was badly impacted by the pandemic. The paper, entitled "Subsidising the spread of Covid-19: Evidence from the UK's Eat Out to Help Out scheme", by Dr Thiemo Fetzer, states: "Given the dramatic rise of Covid-19 infections across the UK in recent weeks, the likely changes in consumer behaviour due to higher infection risks and the ensuing economic damage this generates suggests that the EOHO scheme may have indirect economic and public health costs that vastly outstrip its short-term economic benefits."

> Why not just, “Take Out to Help Out”? You can support your local businesses and still socially distance.

## Most Canadians hope for Trump defeat after insults, attacks

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virus-outbreak-toronto-global-trade-north-america-540a9b934c01b9571bf49b3c3513ce93?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter):

> Some Canadian analysts complain the Trump administration did little to back their country - beyond issuing statements of support - when China detained two Canadians in apparent retaliation for Canada's arrest of a top Chinese tech executive wanted on a U.S. warrant. No support at all came when Saudi Arabia expelled Canada's ambassador and told its own students to leave Canada after the foreign minister called for greater human rights in the kingdom. Heyman said another low point was when Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said there was a "Special place in hell" for Trudeau following the G-7 summit in Quebec in 2018, when Trudeau told reporters that Canada would retaliate against new U.S. tariffs it viewed as unfair.

> Politics aside, we share a lot of media in common with the US, and it'll be the day when I don't have to hear about this mother fucker on a daily basis again.
