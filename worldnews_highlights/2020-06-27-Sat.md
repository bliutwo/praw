Summary of [original article](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/06/27/breaking-hong-kong-police-ban-annual-pro-democracy-demo-for-first-time-in-17-years):

> Hong Kong police have prohibited the annual pro-democracy march on July 1 on the basis of coronavirus social distancing measures and previous unrest, its organiser revealed on Saturday. Another letter sent by police on Friday to District Councilor Andy Chui Chi-kin also denied permission for a protest on July 1. "Due to persisting social unrest, Hong Kong police have cautiously assessed the risks and believe that some participants of this public assembly and public procession may depart from the planned rally location and marching route and violently vandalise buildings as listed above," they wrote.

> In Canada, Ontario Premier Doug Ford is wary of reopening the US-Canada border on July 21 due to the rising cases in multiple US states. On Thursday, the US announced more than 39,000 new coronavirus cases, breaking the single-day record of 36,000 cases it set the day before, according to data from The Washington Post. The growing number of cases in the US has prompted the European Union to say it'll likely bar Americans from traveling to its member states, The New York Times reported on Friday.

> The US is among dozens of countries deemed too risky because their coronavirus outbreaks are poorly contained, according to The Times. The US has recorded more than 2.4 million coronavirus cases and 124,000 deaths, more than any other country. The European border closure, which came later in March, applied to visitors from most countries outside the bloc, not specifically Americans.

## A Toronto police officer who beat a Black teenager so badly he lost an eye has been found guilty of assault, but not aggravated assault.

> Di Luca said it is "Inconceivable" that Michael, who was pursuing Miller on foot without shoes on in winter, failed to identify himself as a police officer or indicate that he was trying to arrest Miller. A Durham police officer who arrived on scene to find Miller bleeding allowed Michael to handcuff Miller. Following the ruling, Miller's lawyer Julian Falconer said he has outstanding questions for Durham and Toronto police, including how Miller was arrested when he was the one who was badly injured, why neither police service involved the SIU, and what role the brothers' dad, a police detective, played in a cover-up.

> It''s a shame that the police seem to get lighter sentences for committing a crime. If anything the punishment should be harsher due to level of trust and responsibility placed on their head.

## Russia Secretly Offered Afghan Militants Bounties to Kill American Troops, U.S. Intelligence Says

> WASHINGTON - American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan - including targeting American troops - amid the peace talks to end the long-running war there, according to officials briefed on the matter. Officials developed a menu of potential options - starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop, along with an escalating series of sanctions and other possible responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step, the officials said. An operation to incentivize the killing of American and other NATO troops would be a significant and provocative escalation of what American and Afghan officials have said is Russian support for the Taliban, and it would be the first time the Russian spy unit was known to have orchestrated attacks on Western troops.

> Outrage has been sparked in Colombia after a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by seven soldiers from the country's army last weekend. On Thursday, seven soldiers confessed to raping the child from the indigenous Emberá tribe, who went missing from her rural reserve in northern Colombia on Sunday. The Emberá community, to which the girl belongs, had previously requested that the perpetrators be subject to their own laws, which Colombia's constitution grants to autonomous indigenous reserves.
