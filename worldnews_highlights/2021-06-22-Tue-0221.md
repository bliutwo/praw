> Unlike glamorous aviation many countries consider seafarers as scum of the earth, a neccessary evil, they want our cargo but they want as little to do with us as possible. Despite carrying approx. 90% of world's trade on our shoulders.
> 
> We are invisible to the public, our jobs are not as glamorous as they used to be and the only time we end up on the news is when a disaster strikes. (/r/aviation has 842000 subscribers while /r/maritime... 4200). Because we are invisible to the public eye many countries have no qualms about treating us like shit as they do not risk public outrage.

> 
> This is just one of those instances. The Master and the crew have reported a dangerous condition in several ports and were told to fuck off, out of sight out of mind, and now the vessel is lost and everyone is screaming and shouting. Who will be responsible for this? The Captain, despite doing everything that he could to prevent this, it always works that way.

> 
> Did you know that since the start of the pandemic 400 000 seafarers have been stuck on board unable to go home? Loads of countries are disregarding international law and have prohibited seaferer transit, trapping them.
> 
> 
> Did you know that seafarers have been refused emergency help while in port "because covid"? You know, stuff like strokes, heart attacks, eye injuries.

> Being at sea has lost its charm and is now begginig to look like glorified slave labour, and nobody cares...

## Great Barrier Reef should be listed as 'in danger', Unesco says

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-57562685):

> The Great Barrier Reef should be put on a list of World Heritage Sites that are "In danger" over harm caused by climate change, Unesco says. The latest row is part of an ongoing dispute between Unesco and the Australian government over the status of the reef, which gained World Heritage ranking in 1981. "The recommendation from Unesco is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change," said Richard Leck, Head of Oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia.

## Fifth presidential candidate detained in Nicaragua; 15 opposition leaders now detained in total

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/americas/nicaragua-fifth-candidate-detained-intl/index.html):

> Mora is the fifth presidential candidate detained this month, along with journalist Cristiana Chamorro, who has been under house arrest since June 2; former diplomat Arturo Cruz, arrested on June 5; and political scientist Félix Maradiaga and economist Juan Sebastián Chamorro, both arrested on June 8. In recent weeks, a total 15 opposition leaders have been arrested and charged with vague, so-called "National security" violations, which human rights groups say is a clear sign that the country's strong-man leader President Daniel Ortega is doing his best to eliminate dissent and crush any competition ahead of upcoming general elections on November 7, a vote where he hopes to secure his fourth consecutive term as president. "The governments of Mexico and Argentina report that today [they] have instructed their ambassadors to Nicaragua, Gustavo Alonso Cabrera Rodríguez and Mateo Daniel Capitanich, to travel to their capitals for consultations on the worrying political-legal actions taken by the Nicaraguan government in recent days, that have put the integrity and freedom of many opposition figures, activists and Nicaraguan businessmen at risk," read a joint statement from the two countries.
