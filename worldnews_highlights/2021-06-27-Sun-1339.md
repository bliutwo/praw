> On Friday, which marks 43 years since the rainbow flag was first used as a symbol of LGBT+ Pride at the 1978 Pride parade in San Francisco, the embassies of Canada, the UK and the US raised the flag in Russia. The embassies in Moscow posted photos of their Pride flags to social media, with the US embassy in Russia spokesperson Jason Rebholz writing: "Today the US Embassy in Russia honours LGBT+ rights during the Pride Flag Day celebration. LGBT+ rights are human rights. Human rights are universal. Everyone deserves to live a life free from hatred, prejudice, and persecution." Last year during Pride month, the foreign ministry in Russia made a formal complaint to the UK, US and Canadian embassies flying the rainbow LGBT+ Pride flag.

## Classified Ministry of Defence documents found at bus stop

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57624942):

> Classified Ministry of Defence documents containing details about HMS Defender and the British military have been found at a bus stop in Kent.One set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the ship's passage through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast on Wednesday. The BBC believes the documents, which include emails and PowerPoint presentations, originated in the office of a senior official at the Ministry of Defence. The documents relating to the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyer, HMS Defender, show that a mission described by the MoD as an "Innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters", with guns covered and the ship's helicopter stowed in its hangar, was conducted in the expectation that Russia might respond aggressively.

> Why in this day and age would anybody print 50 pages of emails and PowerPoints?  Leaving a locked laptop at a bus stop would be far safer than leaving 50 pages of paper
> 
> Either the MoDs info sec is terrible, or this was deliberately done

## UK students want tuition fees refunded as they face third year online

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/26/uk-students-want-tuition-fees-refunded-as-they-face-third-year-online):

> Students are facing a third successive year of online learning, after an Observer analysis suggested that most universities are planning to offer a mix of in-person seminars and online lectures when term begins again this autumn. It prompted fresh calls for students to be refunded at least part of the fees they are charged each year if they are mostly taught online. Some universities are clear about their plans, such as Cardiff, which said all classes over 60 people will be online, while others are more vague, including Durham, which said the mix of online and in-person would depend on the course and year of study, and UCL, which said some modules would be completely online while others will be taught using a blend of online and in-person.

`/u/Darksidedrive` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/o8iotb/uk_students_want_tuition_fees_refunded_as_they/):

> In America they charged us for a childcare fee and provided no childcare option, they charged us to keep the lights on, though all my professors taught from home and they charged us a library fee when they had it closed to us. When asked about the charges they said “everyone has to pay those”
> 
> Edit: because it probably needs a little more clarity; the library fee was the same, even a little more than when the library was open, yea online resources are great but most papers require you cite more than just research papers for whatever paper you’re writing. That usually requires digging the source off the shelves of the library. TBF though none of my professors enforced any rule like that during COVID, however the only courses I took during COVID were 400 level business courses that asked you to argue the abstract and mostly analyzed case studies for their papers. I can imagine those with science degrees might not have been as lucky
