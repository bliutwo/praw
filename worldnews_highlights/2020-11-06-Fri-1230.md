> United Nations - Israeli forces sent demolition vehicles this week to bulldoze a Palestinian village, leaving some 70 civilians, including 41 children, homeless, the United Nations said. While you were eagerly following the US elections, Israel has demolished an entire community's residential compound, leaving 74 people, 41 of them minors, homeless. "Humanitarian agencies visited the community and recorded 76 demolished structures, more than in any other single demolition in the past decade, said Yvonne Helle, the Humanitarian Coordinator at the U.N. agency, adding that the destroyed properties included homes, bathrooms and solar panel arrays that were essential to the community."

> 1 Min Read.MOSCOW - The Kremlin on Friday rejected as untrue a report in Britain's mass market Sun newspaper which suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have Parkinson's disease and be poised to quit early next year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the media report based on Solovei's assertions, which was widely picked up by other British tabloid newspapers, was false. Asked if Putin was planning to step down in the near future as Solovei had suggested, Peskov said: "No". Reporting by Dmitry Antonov and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Andrew Osborn.

> 202 of these are cluster 1 to 4 and not of any importance , It is C5 that has so far only be found in 12 people that is dangerous . The Danish government and the Danish people are doing what they can . To make sure that C5 will not turn in to a pandemic. The cost of this will be roughly 5 billion and the loss of 6000 jobs. I wish more governments would be as fast and serious as the Danish government

## 644 European lawmakers back Taiwan's participation in the upcoming WHO annual assembly

Summary of [original article](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4047070):

> TAIPEI - A total of 644 lawmakers from the European Union and elsewhere in Europe have called on the World Health Organization to include Taiwan in the upcoming annual assembly, which is scheduled to resume virtually next week. "We urge you to invite Taiwan to participate in the WHA as an observer and fully include Taiwan into the WHO meetings, mechanisms and activities, which would be in the interest of all parties concerned," said a letter addressing WHO Director-General Tedros A. Ghebreyesus. The 644 lawmakers are from a variety of parties and signed the letter to show backing for Taiwan.

> If any Chinese leaders are reading, it would be good to read up on US/Canada history, which is very similar. 
> 
> After the revolutionary war the loyalists moved to Canada and the US was unable to defeat them. This lead to Canada being a separate country backed by Britain. A few decades later Britain became a superpower and was undefeated for a century. Very similar to Taiwan being backed by the US. The US had to learn to accept that Canada was a separate country, and that the British would defend them. 
> 
> When the US became a superpower it briefly considered invading Canada, but instead chose to be friends. 
> 
> The US has nothing to gain from invading Canada except sanctions and world condemnation. But by leaving it free they gain one of the best friends the world has ever known. Canada is an exceptionally good friend to the US. They may be the two closest countries on Earth. 
> 
> China should ask itself, what does it gain from being enemies with Taiwan? Nothing. But what does it gain from being friends? An advanced Ally with an excellent reputation and international respect. 
> 
> Taiwan could be China's Canada. Or it can be their permanent enemy. The choice is theirs.
