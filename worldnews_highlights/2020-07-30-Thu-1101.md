## UK KFC admits a third of its chickens suffer painful inflammation - Fast food giant KFC has laid bare the realities of chicken production after admitting to poor welfare conditions among its suppliers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/30/kfc-admits-a-third-of-its-chickens-suffer-painful-inflammation):

> More than a third of the birds on its supplier farms in the UK and Ireland suffer from a painful inflammation known as footpad dermatitis that in severe cases can prevent birds from walking normally. One in 10 KFC chickens also suffer hock burn caused by ammonia from the waste of other birds, which can burn through the skin of the leg - a condition typically associated with inactive birds. "Meeting the criteria in the BCC is no easy feat, but KFC have put in place an active programme outlining the changes that need to be made to improve the brand's supply chain, culminating in the publishing of the first report," said Paula MacKenzie, general manager of KFC UK and Ireland.

> **Polish Towns That Declared Themselves ‘L.G.B.T. Free’ Are Denied E.U. Funds**
> 
> 
> >The governing party in Poland has attacked L.G.B.T. people, using homophobic rhetoric that European officials say has led to unequal treatment.
> 
> 
> >BRUSSELS — The European Union will not provide funding to six Polish towns that have declared themselves “L.G.B.T.-free zones,” a rare financial sanction of a member nation for issues related to the equal treatment of its citizens.
> 
> 
> >While the amounts of money being withheld are modest — from $6,000 to $29,000 — the exclusion of the towns from funding for a program that connects local communities across Europe was intended to have a deeper symbolic resonance.
> 
> 
> >“E.U. values and fundamental rights must be respected by Member States and state authorities,” Helena Dalli, the European Union commissioner for equality, wrote on Twitter. The Polish authorities that adopted “L.G.B.T.-free zones” or “family rights” resolutions failed to protect those rights, she wrote, and their funding applications had therefore been rejected.
> 
> 
> >The decision comes just days after the leaders of the 27-nation European Union bowed to pressure from Poland and Hungary and relaxed a framework devised to tie long-term budget spending by the bloc to issues related to rule of law.
> 
> 
> >Both countries, to different degrees, have steadily chipped away at some of the bedrock institutions that allow for a healthy democracy, including a free press and a judicial system free of political influence.
> 
> 
> >But even as Poland and Hungary have caused increasing consternation in Brussels — both countries have been threatened with having their voting rights in the bloc suspended — they have faced little in the way of concrete punishments.
> 
> >Even by the often brutal standards of Polish politics, however, the demonization of gay men and lesbians by government officials over the past two years has been ferocious.
> 
> >Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing party, has repeatedly told supporters that Poles will not be forced “to stand under the rainbow flag.” He has said that homosexuality represents a “threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.”
> 
> >It has been a campaign amplified by state television, which has been turned into a propaganda arm of the government, and by prominent members of the Catholic clergy.
> 
> 
> >Nearly 100 local governments, representing a third of Poland’s territory, declared themselves “free from L.G.B.T. ideology.”
> 
> 
> >Although the declarations do not have legal force, they are viewed by many as menacing. And the heated rhetoric has been blamed for violence against gay men and lesbians.
> 
> >When marchers tried to take part in a gay pride parade in the conservative city of Bialystok last summer, opponents threw bricks, stones and fireworks at them. Some protesters were attacked and as the violent clashes escalated, with dozens wounded, the police had to deploy tear gas.
> 
> 
> >A few months later, in December, the European Parliament condemned discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community and called on the government to take action to revoke the declarations by local authorities. Nothing was done.
> 
> 
> >During Poland’s recent presidential election in July, the governing party once again targeted gay men, lesbians and transsexuals. President Andrzej Duda said “L.G.B.T. ideology” was more dangerous than communist doctrine and he made it the central issue of his campaign.
> 
> 
> >He narrowly won a second term, but the close fight and divisive rhetoric polarized Polish society even further.
> 
> 
> >And the anti-L.G.B.T. invective has come at a cost. According to a 2020 survey by ILGA, an international gay rights organization, Poland is now the most homophobic country in the European Union.
> 
> >Some Western European municipalities, such as St.-Jean-de-Braye in the north-central French region of Loiret, have already suspended cooperation with towns they were twinned with in Poland that declared themselves “L.G.B.T. free.”
> 
> 
> >The Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Wednesday that the funding decision was “unfounded and unlawful,” arguing that European institutions should respect the national identities of all member countries.
> 
> >Mr. Ziobro denounced the European Commission, saying that some of its members were “ideologically obstinate” and wanted to impose “the agenda of homosexual activists” on others.
> 
> 
> >But Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, which distributes European Union funding, defended the decision to reject sending money to the Polish towns.
> 
> 
> >“Our treaties ensure that every person in Europe is free to be who they are, live where they like, love who they want, and aim as high as they want,” she said in a statement on Thursday. “I will continue to push for a union of equality.”

## Prostate cancer can be detected by a new blood test which also reveals the severity of the disease with 99 per cent accuracy

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8565289/Prostate-cancer-accurately-detected-new-blood-test.html):

> Current blood tests for prostate cancer look for an elevated level of a 'prostate specific antigen' and if the test is positive then a patient is sent for a biopsy. 'New interventions for more accurately detecting the presence of prostate cancer are urgently needed,' said Professor Graham Pockley, Director of Nottingham Trent University's John van Geest Cancer Research Centre. Professor Masood Khan, consultant urologist at University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust and Visiting Professor at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'Improving our ability to detect men harbouring clinically significant prostate cancer will not only reduce the burden on the NHS but also avoid the unnecessary psychological impact of being diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer.

> Russians' trust in President Vladimir Putin fell to a new low in July as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in anti-Kremlin protests in the Far East, according to newly published results from the independent Levada Center pollster. Only 23% of respondents named Putin when asked to identify which politicians they trust the most, the Levada Center said. Putin's approval rating remained steady at 60%.

## WHO warns that waiting to achieve herd immunity to the coronavirus will kill a lot of people

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/who-warns-that-waiting-to-achieve-herd-immunity-to-the-coronavirus-will-kill-a-lot-of-people.html):

> Herd immunity is necessary to really contain a virus, according to epidemiologists. Simply waiting for herd immunity to happen by allowing the virus to spread, as some opponents of social distancing measures have suggested, is dangerous, he added. While the virus may not totally disappear, it's possible world leaders and public health officials could work to bring the virus down to "Low levels," he told the TB Alliance.

> Apparently, infecting 70% of the population as a way to protect the population is... a bad idea.

## WHO promotes China’s organ transplant program, despite allegations of human rights abuses

Summary of [original article](http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/UDHIlJCxuH0/questions-raised-over-the-whos-promotion-of-chinas-organ-transplant-program-despite-allegations-of-illicit-harvesting-and-targeting-of-minorities):

> "In China, doctors could procure multiple organs for the same patient in quick succession, in case of rejection or have as spares. It is not uncommon in China for a patient to receive multiple transplants of the same organ. Furthermore, the vast array of transplantable organ types and their prices openly listed on hospital websites give the impression that any body part can be replaced as needed." At the 27th International Congress of the Transplantation Society in Spain, Dr. Jose Nunez, who oversees global organ transplantation data collection for the WHO, slammed the accusations pertaining to organ harvesting in China as "Rumors." In a September 2017 interview with the Washington Post, he vowed that the number of foreigners going to China for transplants was "Really very low," compared with other countries and that Beijing had reformed. Last December, Dr. Francis L. Delmonico, the former president of The Transplantation Society, the chief medical officer of the New England Organ Bank and chair of the WHO Task Force on donation and transplantation of human organs and tissues, reportedly said: "The biggest feature of the Chinese experience in organ transplantation is the strong support from the Chinese government, which is an example that many countries should follow."
