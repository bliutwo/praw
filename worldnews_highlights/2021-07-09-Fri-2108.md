> The fact that the ice basin beneath has melted from ambient water temperature is not good news.  Then there is fact that when you dump large volumes of fresh water into saline ocean currents it disrupts the flow due to density which then can make huge changes to seasonal weather patterns.

> This should be a huge warning shot to us, but I feel like it's just going to get lost in the shuffle as usual.  I have a young  son who I want to inherit a livable existence on this planet, but I feel like all we are leaving this generation is an accumulation of ignorance and selfishness. Prove me wrong humanity. Please.

> By Euronews with AP. The Italian Senate has approved lowering the voting age in senate elections from 25 to 18, paving the way for four million young people to take part. If enough lawmakers in each chamber request it in the next three months, a nationwide constitutional referendum could be held to confirm the new voting age for the upper legislative chamber. Federico D'Inca, the government minister for parliamentary relations and a member of Italy's populist 5-Star Movement, said lowering the voting age for the Senate "Favours the participation of the new generations in political life."

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210709-bolsonaro-disapproval-rating-surpasses-50-for-first-time):

> Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's disapproval rating passed 50 percent for the first time, according to a poll published by the Datafolha Institute, marking a new low in the far-right leader's declining popularity. Bolsonaro's approval rating also remained at its lowest mark of 24 percent, set in May. His highest approval rating of 37 percent came in December 2020. The Datafolha poll found the popular Lula would defeat 66-year-old Bolsonaro by 58 percent to 31 percent in a second round election run-off - another four percent increase on the difference in May. Both men have their detractors with Bolsonaro's personal rejection rating rising from 54 to 59 percent and Lula's creeping up from 36 to 37 percent.

> Am I the only one thinking « just below » 50% is still pretty high ?

Blinken dated Wednesday, Haiti's envoy to Washington, Bocchit Edmond, said his government was asking the United States to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act "On all perpetrators who are directly responsible or aided and abetted in the execution of the assassination of the president." "Amidst the upsurge of coronavirus cases in Haiti, any additional day without vaccine puts hundreds of lives under threat," Bruno Maes, the organization's Haiti representative, said on Friday. The widely unpopular occupation ended in 1934, but U.S. control over Haiti's finances lasted until 1947.After a series of midcentury coups, the Duvalier family, father-and-son dictators, reigned over Haiti with brute force until the 1980s.
