## Americans Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/02/898165324/americans-go-home-canadians-track-u-s-boaters-sneaking-across-the-border?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news):

> Americans, Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border U.S. pleasure boats have been sneaking into Canada despite a border shutdown. Canada's border patrol has effectively prevented caravans of Americans - and their RVs and their campers - from surging across the border as they normally do each summer. American yachts sneaking across the border makes Creek, and a lot of other Canadians, angry.

> Facebook announced Saturday it has obeyed a Brazilian judge's order for a worldwide block on the accounts of 12 of President Jair Bolsonaro's supporters who are under investigation for allegedly running a fake news network. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said Friday night that the company had failed to fully comply with a previous ruling ordering the accounts to be shut down, saying they were still online and publishing by changing their registration to locations outside Brazil. Facebook issued a statement saying it complied due to the threat of criminal liability for an employee in Brazil.

## U.S. Missionary With No Medical Training Settles Suit Over Child Deaths At Her Center

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/07/31/897773274/u-s-missionary-with-no-medical-training-settles-suit-over-child-deaths-at-her-ce?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_term=nprnews&utm_campaign=npr&utm_medium=social):

> Renee Bach, an American missionary who operated a charitable treatment center for severely malnourished children in Uganda despite having no medical training, has settled a lawsuit brought against her in Ugandan civil court by two women and a civil rights organization. As part of the lawsuit, several former volunteers and staffers at the treatment centers filed affidavits describing incidents during which they witnessed Bach making medical decisions on behalf of children at the center and performing medical procedures, including blood transfusions - often without supervision. The annual death rates at the center - around 20% in 2011 and down to 10% by 2013 - were at levels that would raise red flags by the standards used to judge international charities, according to Saul Guerrero, who specializes in childhood severe acute malnutrition at UNICEF. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015, Bach says the center took in 940 children, of whom 105 died.

## The US ambassador to Brazil reportedly asked Brazilian officials to help Trump’s reelection

Summary of [original article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/8/1/21350810/us-ambassador-brazil-chapman-favor-ethanol-trump-reelection):

> That letter cites Brazilian news articles that report US Ambassador to Brazil Todd Chapman pressured members of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's administration to lower ethanol tariffs in order to support President Donald Trump's reelection efforts. In the letter, Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Eliot Engel demands Chapman explain an article in which the ambassador is said to have asked for the tariffs to be lowered as a "Favor" from the Brazilian government to the Trump reelection campaign. It isn't clear whether Trump was involved in Chapman's reported pressure campaign about ethanol, but as Vox's Zack Beauchamp wrote during 2019's impeachment hearings, the testimony of another of Trump's ambassadors - former US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland - showed a willingness on Trump's part "To use US foreign policy as a tool to cement his own hold on power."

Summary of [original article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/02/national/japan-punishments-coronavirus-measures/):

> Japan may introduce orders and punishments for businesses that fail to meet business suspension requests as part of a revision to a special measures law to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, according to economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura. The recent spread of the virus triggered some prefectural governments to ask people not to make such trips. Omura said the Aichi Prefectural Government will request restaurants in downtown districts to suspend operations if they are deemed to be not taking adequate measures to prevent infections.
