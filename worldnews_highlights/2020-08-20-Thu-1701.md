## "The main reason the Amazon is being deforested is because of human consumption of meat. 90% of the fires started in the Amazon are to clear space to raise cattle and 70% of the fires are happening right next to areas already cleared for cattle grazing by large meat companies".

Summary of [original article](https://sentientmedia.org/60-billion-industry-behind-brazil-exploitation-amazon-rainforest/):

> Human exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest is at an all-time high. While many people argue that the destruction of the Amazon isn't anything new, things have changed drastically in Brazil since the election of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a man who has a self-appointed nickname of Captain Chainsaw and who has spoken on record numerous times about his desire to exploit the Amazon for profit, regardless of the consequences. In the new documentary, Takeout, filmmaker Michal Siewierski takes viewers into the world's largest rainforest to discuss why the Amazon is burning and how global eating habits are responsible.

## Greta Thunberg meets german chancellor Merkel in fresh push for climate action

Summary of [original article](https://news.yahoo.com/merkel-hosts-greta-thunberg-talks-082850074.html):

> Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to be "Brave" in the fight against global warming as she sought to breathe fresh life into a climate movement overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic. The 24-year-old, Germany's most prominent climate activist, said governments were not taking the climate emergency "Nearly as seriously" as the pandemic. Thunberg said the pledge falls far short of what needs to be done and is "Not consistent" with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for the rise in temperatures to be capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius this century compared with pre-industrial levels.

`/u/MaimedPhoenix` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/idcdb9/greta_thunberg_meets_german_chancellor_merkel_in/):

> Merkel previously said that rebuilding the economy will require green proposals. I hope she follows through.
