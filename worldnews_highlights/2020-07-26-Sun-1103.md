## US ‘failures’ are holding back search for coronavirus drugs | The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in “an arbitrary, willy-nilly way”, the expert leading the UK’s programme has warned.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/us-failures-are-holding-back-search-for-coronavirus-drugs):

> The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in "An arbitrary, willy-nilly way", the expert leading the UK's programme has warned. The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines. "There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance," added Landray.

> Sadly, the US (overall - aka Big Pharma) is only looking for old drugs that can be repurposed.  And that is what donald is hyping.   SAD

## Navy on alert for massive Chinese fishing fleet near Galapagos Islands protected waters

Summary of [original article](https://cuencahighlife.com/navy-on-alert-for-massive-chinese-fishing-fleet-near-galapagos-islands-protected-waters/):

> Ecuador is monitoring a large fleet of fishing vessels, most of them Chinese, off the Galapagos Islands protected waters area and has increased patrolling to ensure the ships do not enter the area of the ecologically sensitive islands, Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrín said on Thursday. In 2017, a Chinese vessel was captured in the Galapagos zone carrying 300 tons of marine wildlife, much of it protected species. "The Navy has followed the movement of the fishing fleet since it began mobilizing off the Peruvian coast last month. We have contacted the Chinese government, reminding of the special protections of the Galapagos zone under the United Nations Convention of the Sea," he said.

## France to effectively phase out Huawei gear from 5G networks · TechNode

Summary of [original article](https://technode.com/2020/07/23/france-to-phase-out-huawei-gear-from-its-5g-networks-report/):

> Why it matters: France will effectively phase out the Shenzhen-based company's equipment out from its next-generation 5G networks by 2028, following a similar decision by the United Kingdom this month. Context: Following years of pressure from the United States, more European governments are moving to exclude Huawei from 5G networks. The British government ordered telecom operators last week to remove existing Huawei equipment from their 5G networks by 2027, and banned Huawei gear from the country's 5G network rollout.

## Canadians from Hong Kong rally in Vancouver against Chinese security law

Summary of [original article](https://globalnews.ca/news/7216805/hong-kong-security-law-vancouver-rally/):

> About two dozen protesters gathered outside Oakridge Mall in Vancouver on Friday to protest China's new Hong Kong national security law. Demonstrators say the law threatens freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The bill criminalizes dissent and criticism of the Chinese regime, including from those abroad. Demonstators told Global News they wanted Canadians to know that Hong Kong immigrants to Canada do not support the law, and are calling on Canada to be more vocal in criticizing it.

> Sadly the only safe place to protest for Hong Kong now is overseas
