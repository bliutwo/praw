## Mexican president proposes stripping immunity from US agents

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/international/drugs/528983-mexican-president-proposes-stripping-immunity-from-us-agents):

> Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador submitted a proposal this week that would remove diplomatic immunity from U.S. agents in Mexico. The proposal reportedly will require Drug Enforcement Administration agents to give all information they collect in Mexico to the Mexican government and will require reports to be submitted by any government officials contacted by the agency to Mexico's Foreign Relations Department. "The proposal is that foreign agents will not have any immunity," says a summary published by the Mexican Senate.

## Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated to 'critical' level due to climate change

Summary of [original article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/great-barrier-reef-deteriorated-critical-level-due-climate/story?id=74569794):

> The damage to the reef is a result of ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather, which has resulted in coral bleaching, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's 2020 World Heritage Outlook report, which tracks whether the conservation of the world's 252 natural World Heritage sites is sufficient to protect them in the long term. "Natural World Heritage sites are amongst the world's most precious places, and we owe it to future generations to protect them," Bruno Oberle, the IUCN director general, said in a statement. "The IUCN World Heritage Outlook 3 reveals the damage climate change is wreaking on natural World Heritage, from shrinking glaciers to coral bleaching to increasingly frequent and severe fires and droughts. As the international community defines new objectives to conserve biodiversity, this report signals the urgency with which we must tackle environmental challenges together at the planetary scale."

> Because the oceans absorb two thirds of all emissions, ocean acidification progresses much faster than global warming.
> 
> Basically, even if we limit emissions to 1.5 or 2 degrees warming, the oceanic reefs cannot be saved. 
> 
> If we wanted to save the reefs, we would have needed to curb emissions in the 1980s and 1990s with nuclear technology.
> 
> But after Chernobyl, fossil fuels were seen as preferable and hence we live in a world where ocean reefs will all die out and cannot be saved.

## UN Secretary General says misinformation on Covid-19 is ‘shadow pandemic’

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/coronavirus-conspiracy-united-nations-un-covid-pandemic-b1767067.html):

> UN Secretary General António Guterres has issued a stark warning about increased dependence on digital technology, which he claims is heightening vulnerability to harm and abuse - particularly in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking in a UN web summit, Mr Guterres said "Health and lives" have been put "At risk" by "The shadow pandemic of misinformation about Covid?19". With a Covid vaccine to be disseminated across the UK within the next few days, and other countries with their own vaccines in the final stages of testing, a major concern from Mr Guterres is the interaction between conspiracy theories and public opinion on inoculations.

> If Apple wants to make an environmental benefit, make the phones repairable. You shouldn't need a special kind of screwdriver and just the right temperature of a heating pad to change a battery. This goes for most phone manufacturers today.

## Italy's Forrest Gump: Man argues with wife and walks 450 km to cool off

Summary of [original article](https://www.wantedinmilan.com/news/italys-forrest-gump-man-argues-with-wife-and-walks-450-km-to-cool-off.html):

> A man who stormed out of his home in the north Italian city of Como after arguing with his wife went for a walk - a very long walk - ending up 450 kilometres away in Le Marche a week later. The man was taken to a hotel where he was fed and given lodging, while the next day his wife set out to drive the 450 km to collect her runaway husband who had run up a hotel bill in addition to his €400 fine. The man has been christened "Italy's Forrest Gump" on social media, with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera posing the question: "Had there been no police checks, who knows where he could have ended up."

## Over 250 scientists from 30 different countries call on policy makers to take action to prevent societal collapse

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/06/a-warning-on-climate-and-the-risk-of-societal-collapse):

> Only if policymakers begin to discuss this threat of societal collapse might we begin to reduce its likelihood, speed, severity, harm to the most vulnerable - and to nature. Surveys show many people now anticipate societal collapse. People who care about environmental and humanitarian issues should not be discouraged from discussing the risks of societal disruption or collapse.

`/u/The_Possessor` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k83s2f/over_250_scientists_from_30_different_countries/):

> I, too, would like us to prevent societal collapse, if anyone’s keeping a record or anything.
