> This is a very worthwhile investment in Canada’s surveillance and reconnaissance capability.  We have the largest coastline in the world and, until the end of the last century, one of the planet’s richest fishing grounds.  Illegal foreign fishing has certainly been a problem, costing our fishery dearly.  There is also the pollution problem and the damage to ecosystems (e.g. bird populations etc.) caused by these illegal vessels emptying their bilges in our waters, when they should never been there in the first place.  This technology, along with others, will help cue out on-water assets (I.e frigates, aircraft, coast guard) to intercept these trespassers, deter illegal fishing,  and bring them to account.  
> 
> By the way, the Canadians charged with this responsibility take their job very seriously and they are more than willing and capable to execute fishery patrol missions.  There are many foreign captains who have had their vessels seized and faced massive fines for not respecting our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

## North Korea hacked Pfizer because it wants to sell bootleg COVID vaccines on the international black market, sources say

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-hack-pfizer-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-2021-2):

> North Korean hackers attempted to breach the servers of the US-based vaccine manufacturer Pfizer, and its German partner BioNTech, in hopes of gathering scientific data that could be used to manufacture bootleg copies of a COVID-19 vaccine to sell on international black markets, according to intelligence officials in Europe. "North Korea will have physical access to Pfizer vaccines long after they've seen Chinese or Russian versions. But they want to decide which will be the easiest to bootleg and transport for the black market," said the official, pointing out that both Russia and China have promised millions of doses to North Korea for free, despite the country's claim it has never had a case of COVID. "So they wanted to take a look to see if the Pfizer vaccine would be a viable dose to copy," added the official. Asked if North Korea would be trying to sell a bootleg of some sort, the source said without a doubt, considering North Korea's long history of counterfeiting, bootlegging, drug dealing and arms smuggling through their embassies around the world.

## Ghost particle that crashed into Antarctica traced back to star shredded by black hole

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnet.com/news/ghost-particle-that-crashed-into-antarctica-traced-back-to-star-shredded-by-black-hole/):

> In new research, published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Monday, scientists detail the detection of a subatomic particle - known as a neutrino - at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica. Using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility at California's Palomar Observatory, researchers were able to trace the origins of the subatomic bullet back to an extreme event some 700 million years ago: the cataclysmic destruction of a star as it was shredded by a black hole. Telescopes were able to trace the source of the neutrino back to a distant galaxy that housed a "Blazar" - a huge black hole surrounded by an accretion disc with a jet aimed directly at the observer.
