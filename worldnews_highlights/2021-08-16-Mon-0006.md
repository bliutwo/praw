> The sad but best case scenario to be hoped for is that the Taliban takes the win and controls its forces with no escalation or mass retaliation until US forces finish evacuation and leave the country entirely.  It’s an unrealistic hope that there will not retaliation and violence, but it can be minimized.
> 
> From what I have seen and for what it’s worth, the Taliban is showing significant restraint.

## Scotland could be first county to make environmental destruction a crime under 'ecocide' laws proposed by MSP In June, a team of international lawyers drew up a historic definition of ecocide, which they now want to be adopted by the International Criminal Court (ICC)..

Summary of [original article](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-could-first-county-make-24762289):

> Scotland could become the first country in the world to make environmental destruction a crime under groundbreaking "Ecocide" laws being proposed by an MSP. Glasgow will host world leaders at the COP26 climate change conference in November in the wake of a stark UN warning that global warming now poses a "Code red for humanity". "Lennon added:"Two years after the visionary Polly Higgins' death, we now have an agreed legal definition of ecocide as a potential fifth international crime, putting environmental destruction on a par with genocide and war crimes. "We've put in place arrangements to establish Environmental Standards Scotland as the new governance body which has the ability to keep under review the implementation of international obligations relating to environmental protection legislation."

> The headline is a tabloid mess. All thats happened was a single opposition MSP has sugested this idea, there is barely a story here.

## 800 People Evacuated From Kabul Aboard A Single C-17 Cargo Jet: Reports

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42005/800-people-evacuated-from-kabul-aboard-a-single-c-17-cargo-jet-reports):

> As the situation continues to deteriorate in Afghanistan, with even Kabul's international airport, the last hope for U.S. and other foreigners trying to leave the country, being at least partially overrun, we are now hearing that the U.S. Air Force packed one C-17 cargo jet with roughly 800 people and flew them to safety. Understanding the worsening situation, the aircraft's crew apparently packed what they thought to be around 800 people into the jet's main cargo bay and headed for the safety of Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. There could be a major shortage of jet fuel at Kabul International, as well.
