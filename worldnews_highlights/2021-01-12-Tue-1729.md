## 9,000 children died at 'brutally misogynistic' homes for unmarried mothers in Ireland

Summary of [original article](https://news.sky.com/story/9-000-children-died-at-brutally-misogynistic-homes-for-unmarried-mothers-in-ireland-12185934):

> Unmarried mothers in Ireland faced a "Brutally misogynistic culture" for decades, a minister has said after the publication of a report into the deaths of 9,000 children and babies. There were about 56,000 unmarried mothers and about 57,000 children in the mother and baby homes investigated by the commission. The commission said: "While mother and baby homes were not a peculiarly Irish phenomenon, the proportion of Irish unmarried mothers who were admitted to mother and baby homes or county homes in the 20th century was probably the highest in the world."

> >Mother and baby homes were institutions where young pregnant women were sent, often under pressure from local clergy. There, they would give birth and eventually be separated from their children, who were offered up for adoption, sometimes in the US.
> 
> >Through painstaking research, Catherine Corless established that 796 children had died at the home, and were interred in chambers in a former sewage tank. Local boys playing at the site had previously discovered human bones under a concrete slab.
> 
> >In the 1930s and 1940s, over 40% of children in the homes died before their first birthday, the commission found.
> 
> Sounds more like a dog kennel where if they aren't sold they get put down.

## U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cancelled his Europe trip at the last minute on Tuesday after Luxembourg’s foreign minister and top European Union officials declined to meet him

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pompeo-europe-exclusive-idUSKBN29H2MM?taid=5ffdf2e44156da0001be23c6&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter):

> 5 Min Read.BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cancelled his Europe trip at the last minute on Tuesday after Luxembourg's foreign minister and top European Union officials declined to meet him, European diplomats and other people familiar with the matter said. Pompeo's final visit schedule in Brussels was not going to involve any meetings with the EU or any public events at NATO. A third diplomatic source said allies were "Embarrassed" by Pompeo after the violence in Washington last Wednesday. The cold shoulder was a contrast with Pompeo's previous visits to Brussels, which is home to NATO and EU headquarters, over the past three years, where he has given key-note speeches on U.S. policy and met the EU's chief executive, even as Europe balked at Trump's foreign policy.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/11/insect-populations-suffering-death-1000-cuts-scientists):

> Insect populations are suffering "Death by a thousand cuts", with many falling at "Frightening" rates that are "Tearing apart the tapestry of life", according to scientists behind a new volume of studies. The good news is that the raised profile of insect declines in the past two years has prompted government action in some places, the scientists said, while a "Phenomenal'' number of citizen scientists are helping with the huge challenge of studying these tiny creatures.The 12 new studies are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."Nature is under siege [and] most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event," concludes the lead analysis in the package. "Insects are suffering from 'death by a thousand cuts' [and] severe insect declines can potentially have global ecological and economic consequences.
