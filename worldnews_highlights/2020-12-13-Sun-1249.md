## Supermarkets 'told to stockpile food' as fears grow of no-deal Brexit | Stores reported to have been warned to stockpile food and other essential supplies in anticipation of shortages

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/13/supermarkets-told-to-stockpile-food-as-fears-grow-of-no-deal-brexit):

> The UK government is reported to have warned supermarkets to stockpile food and other essential supplies amid increasing fears of a no-deal Brexit in less than three weeks' time. Rew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: "Retailers and suppliers are doing everything they can to reduce disruption for consumers, including increasing the stock of non-perishable items and looking at alternative supply routes."The main impact [of] Brexit will be on imported fresh produce, such as much fresh fruit and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or consumers. The government has also told suppliers of medicines, medical devices and vaccines to stockpile six weeks' worth at secure locations in the UK.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted the UK has "enough diversity of supply" of medicines in the case of a no-deal.

## The war on cocoa: Hershey Co. accused of not upholding sustainability efforts in West Africa | Critics charge Hershey has become more secretive about how it obtains its cocoa beans.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/war-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-west-n1250798?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma):

> The Coffee and Cocoa Council and the Ghana Cocoa Board were more direct with their accusations when they wrote a letter Nov. 30 to Hershey titled "Abuse of the derivatives market to impoverish the West African farmer." The groups wrote that they "Have observed with great concern the actions taken by your company on the New York terminal" and accused Hershey of using "The exchange to take delivery of physical cocoa." The letter said the LID aims "To improve the incomes of three million of West African cocoa farmers," and as punishment, the groups threatened to bar Hershey from running any of the sustainability programs on which the company prides itself in their countries. By accusing Hershey of buying cocoa beans on an exchange, West African cocoa regulators suggested in their letter that Hershey would not be able to fulfill one of its major recent promises: It could no longer reassure chocolate lovers that the beans it bought on the exchange were not harvested by children, a problem the company had been earnestly addressing.

## Major leak 'exposes' members and 'lifts the lid' on the Chinese Communist Party

Summary of [original article](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6215946537001?fbclid=IwAR3N-wHjCKV_GFUYIiBbpbC84gALUIDof3MZ7-JZn3CTjrq3S2JuOnBVUlU):

> Ms Markson said the leak is a register with the details of Communist Party members, including their names, party position, birthday, national ID number and ethnicity. "Communist party branches have been set up inside western companies, allowing the infiltration of those companies by CCP members - who, if called on, are answerable directly to the communist party, to the Chairman, the president himself," she said. "Along with the personal identifying details of 1.95 million communist party members, mostly from Shanghai, there are also the details of 79,000 communist party branches, many of them inside companies".
