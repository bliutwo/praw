## New Zealand health experts back reform of 'outdated' cannabis laws

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/new-zealand-health-experts-back-reform-of-outdated-cannabis-laws):

> In an editorial in the New Zealand Medical Journal, specialists from the fields of addiction treatment, public health, health promotion and epidemiology have urged New Zealanders to tick yes in the referendum, days after a poll showed the vote on a knife-edge. "Our prohibition model for cannabis is outdated and doesn't work. Supporting law reform is about reframing cannabis use as a health issue which opens up new, more effective ways of minimising harms caused by this drug." The latest New Zealand Health Survey found that 15%, or 590,000 New Zealand adults used cannabis in the past 12 months.

> UK government woos Biden camp, abandoning failing Trump: Sunday Times - Business Insider Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'. It indicates a way to close an interaction, or dismiss a notification. Boris Johnson's government has told ministers to forge ties with the Joe Biden campaign, sensing that Donald Trump is likely to lose the US election, according to The Sunday Times. Biden has indicated that if he wins the presidency, he may prioritize a trade deal with the EU, rather than one between the UK and US. Biden has criticized the UK's conduct during negotiations with the EU, saying that if Johnson's government chooses to break a deal with the EU over Northern Ireland, a US-UK trade deal would not be feasible.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/10/unacceptable-bacteria-levels-found-on-us-meat-may-fuel-fears-over-uk-trade-deal?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other):

> Campaigners fear that a failure to protect UK food standards in law means that a future trade deal with the US might allow more cheaply produced meat to flood the UK market. Trade secretary Liz Truss has argued that parliament would be able to block a trade deal if a majority of MPs wanted a vote on it, but only after the deal had been already been negotiated and signed. The UK's leading expert on food policy Professor Tim Lang said a US trade deal would open the floodgates to worsening standards.

`/u/FinnbarSaunders` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/j9g8aw/unacceptable_bacteria_levels_found_on_us_meat_may/):

> Meanwhile here in the US we shrug and "accept" it, because no one dares to stand up to the meat industry. 
> 
> An industry owned by billionaires who profit by using undocumented labor, lax regulations and apparently unhygienic methods.
