## If Canada has excess COVID-19 vaccines they 'absolutely' will be shared: PM

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/politics/if-canada-has-excess-covid-19-vaccines-they-absolutely-will-be-shared-pm-1.5236745):

> "As Canada gets vaccinated, if we have more vaccines than necessary, absolutely we will be sharing with the world," said Trudeau in an interview with CTV's Question Period host Evan Solomon. Canada has signed contracts guaranteeing access to 214 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines with the option to purchase 200 million more, meaning if all trials pan out, we'd have access to 414 million doses. Last week, Oxfam Canada issued a report saying that Canada was at the top of the list of wealthy countries that have pre-purchased COVID-19 vaccines, and implored Canada to do its part in ensuring all countries can access vaccines.

> I know Canada isn't perfect. I know they have a long way to go on First Nations' rights and reparations, for example. But geezus, every time I get to leave the US and spend time hiking around Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, I'm amazed at how different it feels to be in a country where people have a basic level of care and concern for each other as fellow citizens.
