## Romans have elected a centre-left former economy minister as their next mayor, rejecting by a large margin a right-wing contender dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism, near final results showed Monday

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211018-centre-left-wins-rome-main-prize-in-italy-local-vote):

> With counting complete in more than 92 percent of polling stations, Roberto Gualtieri was leading with more than 60 percent over Enrico Michetti, a lawyer and local talk radio host with no prior political experience. Analysts do not expect the result of the two rounds of local voting to destabilise Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government, which is backed by a left-right coalition including the League but not FDI. On Monday, the centre-left also won Turin, Italy's automotive capital in the north west. "Rome cannot resign itself to talking about just rubbish and potholes. Rome is a great European capital," Gualtieri said at his closing rally on Friday.

> New Zealand is in a similar situation to Australia. Our vaccine rollout isnâ€™t high enough to let delta rip so either everyone stays locked down longer or vaccinated people are allowed to go out and get the economy moving again and unvaccinated people have to stay locked down a bit longer.  It is temporary and it will end. In Australia the govt is talking about December 1st to remove the restrictions on unvaccinated people. New Zealand will do it too when they are satisfied with their vaccination levels. They are working hard and creatively to get there quickly.

## Inmate who leaked Russia prison rape video seeks French asylum

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211018-inmate-who-leaked-russia-prison-rape-video-seeks-french-asylum):

> The former inmate behind a video leak showing alleged rape and torture inside a Russian prison said he could no longer keep the explosive revelations to himself, speaking to AFP from France where he is now seeking asylum. After the video was published online by Gulagu.net, a rights group dedicated to exposing abuses in Russian jails, Russia's Federal Prison Service announced a probe into the incident. The head of the jail, where prisoners needing medical attention for tuberculosis are held, was sacked, along with three regional prison officials.

`/u/JBredditaccount` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/qavary/inmate_who_leaked_russia_prison_rape_video_seeks/):

> Oh god, he stole a thousand videos -- that sounds like they were recorded by the guards or security cameras.
> 
> And then the Russians tried to negotiate to get him to go back to rape-prison for 4 years as a penalty for revealing the abuse.

## A Chinese propaganda film about the defeat of the US Army is set to become the country's highest grossing film ever

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-movie-defeating-us-army-becoming-highest-grossing-ever-2021-10):

> A Chinese state-backed propaganda epic about the defeat of US troops is on track to become the country's highest grossing movie of all time. It appears to be paying off: Based on current trajectories, "The Battle at Lake Changjin" is set to become the highest grossing film of all time in the country, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported Sunday. The Chinese ticketing portal Maoyan has estimated that "The Battle at Lake Changjin" will end up making a total $843 million, Deadline reported, which could make it narrowly lose out to "Wolf Warriors II." However, this would still mean it beats China's "Hi, Mom" to become the highest grossing movie of 2021 anywhere in the world.

> Why is this news? Hollywood puts out like 10 fictional movies a year where they defeat random countries to save the planet.

## Australia is trying to vaccinate all of its koalas against chlamydia

Summary of [original article](https://www.insider.com/australia-koalas-vaccinated-against-chlamydia-2021-10):

> Australia is rolling out a chlamydia vaccine trial among koalas in the country. About 400 koalas will be vaccinated as part of the trial, and researchers told Reuters that they hope the vaccine will help the animals survive longer as a species. The Australian Koala Foundation, an independent non-profit group, told Reuters in September that it estimates that Australia has lost about 30% of its koala population over the last three years.
