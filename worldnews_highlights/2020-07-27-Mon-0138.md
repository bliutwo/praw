> WELLINGTON - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party raced ahead of rivals in the latest opinion poll, putting the charismatic 40-year-old leader on track for a comfortable victory in the elections in September. The popularity of the main opposition National Party, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and leadership changes, plunged to 25.1%. According to the survey the Labour Party, which is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, would win 77 of 120 seats in parliament. Ardern's own popularity as preferred prime minister was sky high at 62%, while the National Party's newly elected 61-year-old leader Judith Collins stood at just 14.6%. Ardern has consistently polled ahead of her rivals and her popularity has risen further this year as she won global praise for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.
