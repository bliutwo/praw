On Monday, a video of Protasevich was released on social media in which he claimed to be in good health and admitted he was behind "Civil disturbances" in Belarus.

> This is just absolutely ridiculous the way we use our natural resources.
> 
> If we manage forests properly, we can harvest one area, replant it, and come back in 50 years and harvest again. Repeat forever and you have unlimited and never ending forest products as long as trees grow.
> 
> No need to harm protected and sensitive areas.
> 
> Sir David Attenborough, the famed naturalist, had the same thought in regards to fishing.
> 
> Designate certian areas as protected breeding zones for fish. No fishing whatsoever. Fish will then migrate to areas where fishing is allowed.
> 
> Boom. Unlimited fish for ever.
> 
> It is shocking that a developed country like Canada allows this crap

## Soldier who called on troops to refuse vaccine distribution faces mutiny related charge

Summary of [original article](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/soldier-who-called-on-troops-to-refuse-vaccine-distribution-faces-mutiny-related-charge):

> A soldier who called on his fellow military personnel to refuse helping with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has been charged with an offence related to mutiny. Kenderesi, who had a civilian hunting knife strapped to his Canadian Forces uniform and was carrying a non-Canadian helmet, questioned the safety of the vaccine. Ottawa lawyer Michel Drapeau said the laying of a charge related to mutiny is unheard of in the Canadian Forces in modern times.

## Belarus closing Canadian embassy as PM Trudeau condemns regime

Summary of [original article](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/belarus-closing-canadian-embassy-as-pm-trudeau-condemns-regime-1.5441786):

> OTTAWA - The Government of the Republic of Belarus has announced it will be closing its embassy in Canada, just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Belarusian authorities over the forced diversion of a passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist. During a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau called Belarus' actions "Outrageous, illegal, and completely unacceptable." He said the Canadian government is calling for Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich to be released immediately. "It is assumed that the consular functions of the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in Canada would further be performed by the Consulate General of the Republic of Belarus in New York, United States of America," reads the notice on the embassy's website.

## Coronavirus: Influencers offered money to badmouth Pfizer vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/05/coronavirus-influencers-offered-money-to-badmouth-pfizer-vaccine.html):

> Several French social media influencers say they have been approached by a communications agency which offered them money to spread negative publicity about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a ploy the health minister described as dangerous and irresponsible. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech last November became the first drug manufacturers to report successful initial data from a large coronavirus vaccine clinical trial. One of the operators of 'Et ca se dit medecin', which has about 30,000 followers on Twitter and 90,000 on Instagram, also said on RMC TV he had been offered money to discredit the Pfizer vaccine.

`/u/bombayblue` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nl0qta/coronavirus_influencers_offered_money_to_badmouth/):

> Paid by Russia. Don’t forget that.

## EU locks out Belarus from international aviation

Summary of [original article](https://euobserver.com/world/151927):

> EU leaders have agreed a first wave of economic sanctions against Belarus over Sunday's hijacking and said there were more to come. The EU "Calls on all EU-based carriers to avoid overflight of Belarus" and will "Ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines", leaders said in a joint statement after meeting in Brussels on Monday. Speculation was rife among EU diplomats on whether Russia had had a hand in the Belarus fiasco.

`/u/European_Unity` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nklqqs/eu_locks_out_belarus_from_international_aviation/):

> This is very serious response from the EU and should severely cripple Belarus. Their airline is effectively dead and will no longer generate income for their state. This is much more severe than the usual sanction we see coming from the EU. I think it's a good signal showing you can't simply divert planes with fake bomb threats and military coercion.

## Belarus bans journalists from live reporting at protests: President Alexander Lukashenko has signed a new law sharply restricting media activities in Belarus. The government can now order a media outlet's closure without a court decision

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/belarus-bans-journalists-from-live-reporting-at-protests/a-57649288):

> "This is the most repressive media law in Europe, which turns the work of journalists in Belarus into a minefield," said Andrei Bastunets, president of the Belarusian Association of Journalists. According to the association, nearly 30 journalists are currently in prison in Belarus. Widespread protests erupted across Belarus for weeks in 2020, following an allegedly fraudulent election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in power.
