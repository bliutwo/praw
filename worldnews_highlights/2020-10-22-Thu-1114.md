## US approves $1.8bn weapons sale to Taiwan

Summary of [original article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54641076):

> Last week, US national security adviser Robert O'Brien said that while he did not believe China was ready to invade Taiwan, the island needed to "Fortify itself" for the future. The BBC's Taiwan correspondent Cindy Sui says that under President Donald Trump, the US has sold significantly more weapons to Taiwan than before. While the US does sell Taiwan arms, and has an implicit security guarantee, it does not have a formal defence treaty with Taiwan as it does with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.

## Canada's bill to outlaw LGBTQ2 conversion therapy has global influence: UN expert

Summary of [original article](https://www.cp24.com/news/canada-s-bill-to-outlaw-lgbtq2-conversion-therapy-has-global-influence-un-expert-1.5153935):

> Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, October 21, 2020 7:33AM EDT. OTTAWA - A United Nations expert says proposed Canadian legislation that would ban forcing children or adults into therapy to alter their sexual orientation or gender identity could help further LGBTQ2 rights globally. Victor Madrigal-Borloz, the UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, told The Canadian Press that bills such as the one tabled by the federal Liberals earlier this month are one of the most effective ways to protect and advance LGBTQ2 rights. The bill aims to ban so-called conversion therapy, which involves forcing a person into therapy against their will.
