> International observers from the Organization of American States have said in a preliminary report that they saw no instances of fraud or voting irregularities in the U.S. presidential election. The delegation included 28 experts and observers from 13 countries who studied the election process in Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and the District of Columbia. A detailed report which will expand on the OAS's initial findings will be presented in Washington D.C. The report concluded by saying that the "2020 elections have been historic in many ways", stating that "While the environment of the elections was competitive and fraught, the ability of voters across the country to access the vote in less than ideal circumstances, exemplifies the democracy for which the United States is renowned and which it has championed across the globe."

> Why is Bolsonaro opposed to a vaccine, even if the company developing the vaccine is promoted by a political foe? Or am I misreading the article? It seems like there is no logical reason to oppose a vaccine rollout, unless your sole motive in the crisis is to spread the virus and death. Less deaths would make him look good, regardless of the company that produced the vaccine.

## Enslaved people rescued from illegal Brazilian gold mine

> Nunes - who was added to the "Dirty list" in April as a consequence of the 2018 raid - was not at the site at the time of the latest raid, but was identified by several workers as their boss, said Riga. Slavery in Brazil is defined as forced labour but also includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, long hours that pose a health risk or work that violate human dignity. Workers at the illegal mine in Paras state had to buy food and protective gear from their employers at inflated prices, Riga said, and reports indicated some workers were afraid to leave without paying their debts.

## Jair Bolsonaro asks Brazilians not to deal with Covid-19 'like f*gs'

Summary of [original article](https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/jair-bolsonaro-asks-brazilians-not-to-deal-with-covid-19-like-fags-914199.html#):

> President Jair Bolsonaro drew criticism Tuesday for telling Brazilians not to deal with Covid-19 like "a country of fags," the far-right leader's latest controversial outburst on the pandemic. "All anyone talks about these days is the pandemic. We need to stop that," said Bolsonaro during the speech, which was ostensibly on tourism. CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH. "Recently, a big-shot presidential candidate said if I didn't put out the wildfires in the Amazon he would impose trade sanctions on Brazil," Bolsonaro said, apparently referring to a comment Biden made during his first debate with Trump in September.
