> Biden has criticized China every week, including directly criticizing Xi in a phone call. He has increased patrols in the SCS. And invited the Taiwanese delegation to his inauguration, a historic first.

## Great Barrier Reef found to be in failing health as world heritage review looms | Great Barrier Reef

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/18/great-barrier-reef-found-to-be-in-failing-health-amid-calls-for-urgent-action):

> The world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system but is under increasing pressure from climate heating that caused mass bleaching events in 2016, 2017 and 2020.The report's monitoring period ended before the onset of widespread bleaching in early 2020.Scientists say improving water quality and reducing sediments, fertilisers and chemicals running into the reef's waters will give the system a greater chance of recovering from future bleaching. Some rules around better record keeping are already in place, but others are scheduled for later this year and 2022.Dr Lissa Schindler, Great Barrier Reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report card showed governments "Still have a long way to go" to reach the water quality targets being eyed by the world heritage committee. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: "We know that the world is watching on for Australia's performance in improving water quality on the great barrier reef and it's concerning that progress is slow. But it is heartening that there is some progress."The Queensland and Australian government need to commit to long-term investments to improving water quality and to make sure the reef regulations are adequately enforced.

> Facebook said Wednesday that Australian users and publishers will not be able to post news content to its social network after the country's government threatened to force it to pay publishers. Facebook's announcement came hours after Google took the opposite approach and announced that it would pay publishers, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., for the ability to feature their content in its dedicated news product, Google News Showcase. For months, Google and Facebook have been in a standoff with Australia over whether to pay news organizations for the right to link to their journalism.
