## Uighur group calls for China to lose 2022 Games over 'genocide'

Summary of [original article](https://www.france24.com/en/20200730-uighur-group-calls-for-china-to-lose-2022-games-over-genocide-1):

> An overseas-based Uighur group urged the IOC on Thursday to reconsider holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of what it says is China's "Genocide" of the Uighur population. In an open letter to International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress accused China of "Committing genocide, crimes against humanity and torture against the Uighur and other Turkic peoples" in Xinjiang. "We have so far been greatly disappointed that the International Olympic Committee has not addressed the human rights situation in China since awarding Beijing the right to host the 2022 Winter Olympics," the letter, signed by WUC president Dolkun Isa, said.

> **Polish Towns That Declared Themselves ‘L.G.B.T. Free’ Are Denied E.U. Funds**
> 
> 
> >The governing party in Poland has attacked L.G.B.T. people, using homophobic rhetoric that European officials say has led to unequal treatment.
> 
> 
> >BRUSSELS — The European Union will not provide funding to six Polish towns that have declared themselves “L.G.B.T.-free zones,” a rare financial sanction of a member nation for issues related to the equal treatment of its citizens.
> 
> 
> >While the amounts of money being withheld are modest — from $6,000 to $29,000 — the exclusion of the towns from funding for a program that connects local communities across Europe was intended to have a deeper symbolic resonance.
> 
> 
> >“E.U. values and fundamental rights must be respected by Member States and state authorities,” Helena Dalli, the European Union commissioner for equality, wrote on Twitter. The Polish authorities that adopted “L.G.B.T.-free zones” or “family rights” resolutions failed to protect those rights, she wrote, and their funding applications had therefore been rejected.
> 
> 
> >The decision comes just days after the leaders of the 27-nation European Union bowed to pressure from Poland and Hungary and relaxed a framework devised to tie long-term budget spending by the bloc to issues related to rule of law.
> 
> 
> >Both countries, to different degrees, have steadily chipped away at some of the bedrock institutions that allow for a healthy democracy, including a free press and a judicial system free of political influence.
> 
> 
> >But even as Poland and Hungary have caused increasing consternation in Brussels — both countries have been threatened with having their voting rights in the bloc suspended — they have faced little in the way of concrete punishments.
> 
> >Even by the often brutal standards of Polish politics, however, the demonization of gay men and lesbians by government officials over the past two years has been ferocious.
> 
> >Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing party, has repeatedly told supporters that Poles will not be forced “to stand under the rainbow flag.” He has said that homosexuality represents a “threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.”
> 
> >It has been a campaign amplified by state television, which has been turned into a propaganda arm of the government, and by prominent members of the Catholic clergy.
> 
> 
> >Nearly 100 local governments, representing a third of Poland’s territory, declared themselves “free from L.G.B.T. ideology.”
> 
> 
> >Although the declarations do not have legal force, they are viewed by many as menacing. And the heated rhetoric has been blamed for violence against gay men and lesbians.
> 
> >When marchers tried to take part in a gay pride parade in the conservative city of Bialystok last summer, opponents threw bricks, stones and fireworks at them. Some protesters were attacked and as the violent clashes escalated, with dozens wounded, the police had to deploy tear gas.
> 
> 
> >A few months later, in December, the European Parliament condemned discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community and called on the government to take action to revoke the declarations by local authorities. Nothing was done.
> 
> 
> >During Poland’s recent presidential election in July, the governing party once again targeted gay men, lesbians and transsexuals. President Andrzej Duda said “L.G.B.T. ideology” was more dangerous than communist doctrine and he made it the central issue of his campaign.
> 
> 
> >He narrowly won a second term, but the close fight and divisive rhetoric polarized Polish society even further.
> 
> 
> >And the anti-L.G.B.T. invective has come at a cost. According to a 2020 survey by ILGA, an international gay rights organization, Poland is now the most homophobic country in the European Union.
> 
> >Some Western European municipalities, such as St.-Jean-de-Braye in the north-central French region of Loiret, have already suspended cooperation with towns they were twinned with in Poland that declared themselves “L.G.B.T. free.”
> 
> 
> >The Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Wednesday that the funding decision was “unfounded and unlawful,” arguing that European institutions should respect the national identities of all member countries.
> 
> >Mr. Ziobro denounced the European Commission, saying that some of its members were “ideologically obstinate” and wanted to impose “the agenda of homosexual activists” on others.
> 
> 
> >But Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, which distributes European Union funding, defended the decision to reject sending money to the Polish towns.
> 
> 
> >“Our treaties ensure that every person in Europe is free to be who they are, live where they like, love who they want, and aim as high as they want,” she said in a statement on Thursday. “I will continue to push for a union of equality.”

## Hong Kong bans 11 pro-democracy figures from legislative election | Hong Kong Free Press HKFP

Summary of [original article](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/30/breaking-hong-kong-bans-8-pro-democracy-figures-from-legislative-election/):

> Joshua Wong and 11 other Hong Kong pro-democracy election hopefuls have been disqualified from running in the 2020 Legislative Council election. Returning officer Alice Choi wrote: "From my perspective, the real reason for the candidate to withdraw from Demosisto and for Demosisto to be disbanded is to evade punishment under the newly-passed Hong Kong national security law." Wong said the election bans showed a disregard for the will of Hongkongers: "#Beijing now staged the biggest-ever [crackdown] on the city's election, by disqualifying nearly all pro-democracy runners, from young progressive groups to traditional moderate parties Our resistance will continue on and we hope the world can stand with us in the upcoming uphill battle.

## UK KFC admits a third of its chickens suffer painful inflammation - Fast food giant KFC has laid bare the realities of chicken production after admitting to poor welfare conditions among its suppliers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/30/kfc-admits-a-third-of-its-chickens-suffer-painful-inflammation):

> More than a third of the birds on its supplier farms in the UK and Ireland suffer from a painful inflammation known as footpad dermatitis that in severe cases can prevent birds from walking normally. One in 10 KFC chickens also suffer hock burn caused by ammonia from the waste of other birds, which can burn through the skin of the leg - a condition typically associated with inactive birds. "Meeting the criteria in the BCC is no easy feat, but KFC have put in place an active programme outlining the changes that need to be made to improve the brand's supply chain, culminating in the publishing of the first report," said Paula MacKenzie, general manager of KFC UK and Ireland.

## Chile picks Japan's trans-Pacific cable route in snub to China

Summary of [original article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Telecommunication/Chile-picks-Japan-s-trans-Pacific-cable-route-in-snub-to-China):

> TOKYO/SAO PAULO - Chile has chosen a route proposed by Japan for the first fiber-optic cable to directly connect South America and the Asia-Pacific region, designating Australia and New Zealand as endpoints while stopping short of landing in China, Nikkei has learned. Japan and Australia just completed their own submarine cable linking the two countries this month, meaning Japan could easily connect to the trans-Pacific cable. With Chile adopting Japan's route for the cable, Japanese companies will have an edge in winning contracts for supplying equipment.
