> I'm sure the UN will send the CCP a very firm email outlining how they better stop right now or they’re gonna be VERY disappointed. 
> 
> Jokes aside, if we don't address this now it's going to become even more of a problem down the road. Every time China gets away with shit like this they look at what they did, and quietly note that they can keep doing that thing without any problems. They keep doing this and in doing so they are moving the line of what is acceptable and keep testing how much the international community is willing to tolerate. As long as there is no reaction, there is absolutely no reason for the CCP to stop their behaviour, and the more we tolerate, the bolder the CCP will get.

## Irish president attacks 'feigned amnesia' over British imperialism

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/11/irish-president-michael-d-higgins-critiques-feigned-amnesia-over-british-imperialism):

> Ireland's president, Michael D Higgins, has made a sharp critique of British imperialism and the "Feigned amnesia" of academics and journalists who refuse to address its legacy. "A feigned amnesia around the uncomfortable aspects of our shared history will not help us to forge a better future together," he says, contrasting British forgetfulness with Ireland's reflections on its war of independence and partition a century ago. In 2014 Higgins made the first address to the British parliament by an Irish president.

`/u/nonke71` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/lhll9o/irish_president_attacks_feigned_amnesia_over/):

> > British imperialists did not recognise the Irish as equals, he says. “At  its core, imperialism involves the making of a number of claims which  are invoked to justify its assumptions and practices – including its  inherent violence. One of those claims is the assumption of superiority  of culture.” 
> 
> i think this just about sums up imperialism, whether it was done by the british, the spanish or anyone else.. There was the assumption that the people that they colonised were savages and there was never really any attempt to find out about the cultures that they inevitably destroyed.. To this day, there has never really been any acknowledgement of the impact of the imperialism, maybe we may never get it, but it is something that should be done.

> Key fact from the article:
> 
> Kara-Murza's toxicology report and investigation were extensively redacted by the FBI. Coincidentally, in January 2018, the three chiefs of Russia’s secret services – FSB, GRU and SVR– had visited the US capital in an unprecedented group trip, and met with then CIA chief Mike Pompeo and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

> The head of the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee is stepping down from his job after more than a week of backlash for his sexist remarks-but experts say it's hardly a victory for women's rights in Japan. On Feb. 3, Mori, 83, said at an Olympics committee meeting that women talk too much in meetings. Ting believes some small good could still come from the scandal over Mori's comments.

## Biden raises coercion of Taiwan and human rights abuses with Xi Jinping in first phone call

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/11/biden-raises-taiwan-tensions-and-human-rights-with-xi-jinping-in-first-phone-call):

> Joe Biden has affirmed the US's tough line on China's human rights abuses and regional expansionism in his first phone call with president Xi Jinping since taking office. The call came just hours after the announcement of Biden's establishment of a Pentagon task force on China and a senior state department official meeting in person with Taiwan's representative to the US. The US's support for Taiwan, which is fending off aggression and threats of "Unification" from Beijing, is one of the most sensitive issues in the US-China relationship, and one raised by Biden during the call. Ahead of the Xi call a senior administration official briefed reporters that the Biden team had "Found merit" in the Trump administration's "Basic proposition of an intense strategic competition with China but we found deep problems with the way in which the Trump administration went about that competition," Axios reported.
