> "Malevolent intent" is interesting wording. I think there's a very strong argument that filming police brutality, corruption or other deriliction of duty is done with benevolent intent.

> The mistake here was firing into a vehicle the police suspected had a hostage in it. 
> 
> That is the epic level fuck up.
> 
> Killing the child was the result of this epic level fuck up.
> 
> If they hadn't known about the child this would have merely been an unfortunate accident. The police have no excuse here. In this case, they were stopping the vehicle *because they knew it contained a hostage*. Knowing the guy driving it had a hostage, they decided not to follow protocol and back off in order to negotiate. Instead, **they decided it was worth risking the child's life to kill the driver, rather than not risk the child's life and and de-escalate the situation.**
> 
> This is piss poor... no not piss poor. This was a choice to deliberately endanger an innocent person, namely the dead child, all in the name of ignoring best practices, their training, and the hostage's life.
> 
> There is literally no excuse for them to have opened fire on the car.
> 
> None.
> 
> edit: spelling
> 
> edit 2: What else could they have possibly done?" or "He tried to run over a cop, what else could they have done?" Has already been answered, by me and several dozens of people. If you can't think of anything besides "Fucking shoot into a car that has a hostage in it and pray you don't hit it!" then you really should take the time consider any of the myriad other possibilities, many of which have been presented in this thread.
> 
> If you think the only two options are fire wildly into a car with a hostage in it or "do nothing", or some other version of "let them go" you're not too smart and need to learn to count past two (2).
> 
> I'll reiterate. There were hundreds of options that didn't involve placing that child in the path of incoming fire.
> 
> edit 3: Shutting down inbox replies. Too may idiots trying to justify killing a baby. I don't need that shit in my life. Also, getting out ahead of this before any more show up; please don't give me any more awards. If you have to, donate your hard earned money during this pandemic to those that need it. Any charity will do. From food banks to charities for children whose parents have been killed by senseless violence, make your money do something besides fill Reddit's bank accounts.

## Pope Blasts Those Who Criticize COVID Restrictions in the Name of “Personal Freedom”

Summary of [original article](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/pope-francis-blasts-critics-covid-restrictions-personal-freedom.html?via=recirc_recent):

> Pope Francis praised health care workers and criticized those who are protesting restrictions imposed by governments to stop the spread of COVID-19 in a New York Times op-ed. Some governments have "Shrugged off the painful evidence of mounting deaths, with inevitable, grievous consequences." And other governments that have acted decisively have received pushback. "To come out of this crisis better, we have to recover the knowledge that as a people we have a shared destination," Francis wrote.

`/u/Buckabuckaw` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k2n0pe/pope_blasts_those_who_criticize_covid/):

> I'm concerned that Slate magazine has taken Pope Francis' simple and eloquent plea (in his letter to the NYT) for all of us to care for one another, and labels it "Pope **Blasts** Those Who Criticize COVID Restrictions".
> 
> This is the the kind of language that inflames anger and disgust between political tribes and, not coincidentally, grabs eyes and sells ads.

## UK Government ready for 100 per cent increase in Hong Kong citizens coming to UK

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/27/government-prepares-give-three-million-hong-kong-citizens-sanctuary/):

> The Government is preparing for a 100 per cent increase in the number of Hong Kong citizens coming to Britain after Boris Johnson offered up to three million residents sanctuary. The Foreign Office estimated that 200,000 people would move from Hong Kong to the UK, but a leaked internal briefing paper warned of a "Rapid rise in the issue of British National passports since June". BN(O) passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months.

> F government overreach. I think young people growing up w internet will not be as submissive as previous generations.  My heart goes out to so many countries citizens subjected to suppression and totalitarianism.

## Tackling drunken students by night, teaching by day: PhD students say they are being exploited

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/28/tackling-drunken-students-by-night-teaching-by-day-phd-students-say-they-are-being-exploited):

> McDonald, who receives no salary for being an assistant warden, says she and other PhD students in her position face "Massive amounts of abuse" from undergraduates upset about being told to stick to the rules. Another PhD student in her department says that young researchers are furious with UKRI, but feel that universities often forget to communicate with PhD students. Ruth Smith, who is in the third year of her PhD at Leeds University on the relationship between gender, agriculture and climate change in Tanzania, says: "The pandemic has opened my eyes to how badly PhD students are treated in the UK. In most European countries PhD researchers are treated as staff. They are much better paid and are entitled to support like sick pay. In the UK, we are relied on as staff members but not treated that way."

`/u/D34DS1GHT` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k2m92z/tackling_drunken_students_by_night_teaching_by/):

> What the fuck are these comments, filled with people who don't seem to understand what a PhD is, and seem to think that adults performing the duties of staff in addition to their research are whiny entitled brats for feeling exploited by the lack of compensation for that.
