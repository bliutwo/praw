## Scotland pulls up the drawbridge making it illegal to enter from rest of UK

Summary of [original article](https://metro.co.uk/2020/11/19/uk-lockdown-travel-to-and-from-scotland-made-illegal-13625330/):

> According to a draft document published on Thursday evening, anyone living in Scotland must not travel to any other part of the common travel area - England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - nor can anyone from those places travel to Scotland. Exemptions to the travel ban also apply for more common essential travel reasons, including for health reasons, work or for school. 'For another, it's not clear that the Scottish parliament can make rules contrary to the common travel area, as agreed to by the UK and Ireland.

> 
> Facebook agreed to step up censorship of anti-government posts in April, the official said, according to Reuters. The government in August made another request for the company to block content critical of the state, it said.
> 
> “Over the past few months, we’ve faced additional pressure from the government to restrict more content,” Facebook said in an email statement. “However, we will do everything we can to ensure that our services remain available so people can continue to express themselves.”

`/u/Arcvalons` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jxbkdt/mexican_senate_committees_formally_approve/):

> That was yesterday. Senate just voted for it in the full floor seconds ago, now they'll have to discuss some points some Senators disagreed with, and when that is done, it goes to the lower chamber and then the executive. 
> 
> The executive might be the hardest part, because the President said he's against, but he said he would let the legislative decide too.
> 
> Edit: It was just approved in the Senate in general and with reservations, so the next step is the lower chamber, which should be happening in the next few days.

## G20 leaders must urge Saudi Arabia to release prisoners: Amnesty

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/19/g20-leaders-must-urge-saudi-arabia-to-release-prisoners-amnesty):

> In a statement released on Thursday, the United Kingdom-based rights group said activists who led campaigns for women's rights in the Gulf country continue to be imprisoned or are facing trial, despite the fact that women's empowerment is on Saudi Arabia's G20 agenda. Saudi Arabia, the first Arab nation to host the G20 summit, had planned for a grand meeting that would showcase the ambitious modernisation drive of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. Rights groups say at least three of the jailed women, including al-Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault - charges Saudi officials have denied.
