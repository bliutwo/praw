## 'This is over the top': Lindsey Graham and Mick Mulvaney 'begged' Trump not to kill Iran's top general, but 4 days later he did it anyway, according to Woodward's new book

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-mick-mulvaney-begged-trump-not-kill-soleimani-woodward-2020-9):

> Trump and Graham were playing golf at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, when Trump floated the idea. Graham pushed back, saying Soleimani has "Always been doing that." He added that Trump had to consider his response and what Iran might do in retaliation, especially "With the election coming." The Trump administration has not made public evidence that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to US forces in the region, which was its primary justification for the strike.

## Japan's Defense Minister: China not a ‘concern’ for Japan. It is now a ‘security threat’

Summary of [original article](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13717925):

> Defense Minister Taro Kono went beyond the government's official stance by describing China as a "National security threat" to Japan. "But as defense minister, I must say China has become a security threat to Japan." The government has repeatedly voiced concerns about China's military advances in the South China Sea and other parts of the region, but Japan has not gone so far as to describe such moves as a threat.

## Al-Qaeda threatens Charlie Hebdo for republishing Mohammed cartoons

Summary of [original article](https://news.yahoo.com/al-qaeda-threatens-charlie-hebdo-204153548.html):

> Al-Qaeda has threatened French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo with a repeat of a 2015 massacre of its staff, after it republished controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, the SITE observatory said on Friday.

Charlie Hebdo's director Laurent Sourisseau, known as "Riss" and who was himself badly wounded in the shoulder in the attack, told the court this week that there was nothing to regret in publishing the cartoons.
