## Discovered: Mass graves created by Mexico's state police as little as three years ago. One victim, Arturo Figueroa, 20, was in his final semester at nursing school when he disappeared

Summary of [original article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-the-disappeared-inside-families-risky-search-to-uncover-the-truth/):

> The Solecitos trusted only the federal forensic police lab to analyze the remains found at Colinas. As these nine families were searching for their missing, Human Rights Watch was tracking disappearance investigations across Mexico and found that systematic obstruction was common. Members of all of the security forces participating in public security operations - federal, state, and municipal police, the Army, and the Navy, as well as judicial police - are implicated in the cases.

> American shit-cops are a problem, it's nothing compared to what these families go through. You're taught to keep your cop $ in your shirt pocket, if you reach in your jeans they might shoot

## Germany says it dealt with COVID-19 so well that some people doubted the virus' existence, and broke the rules. It just reported its highest daily death toll, at 487.

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-handled-covid-19-well-people-dont-take-it-seriously-2020-12):

> Germany dealt with the first wave of COVID-19 so well that people questioned how serious the virus was, and even doubted its existence, the head of its public health agency said Thursday. As of Thursday morning, Germany had reported more than 1.1 million cases of COVID-19, according to RKI data. "I am sure that as more cases occur, as people see it among their acquaintances, and more people see how it is a serious illness that they don't want to catch, one with long-term consequences, then I think compliance will improve," Wieler said.

> I think that's also how vaccine deniers happened - vaccines worked so well, that people forgot just how horrible things could be before vaccines, so now you have people denying that we even need them.

## Facebook to ban anti-vaxx conspiracy theories

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/covid-vaccine-facebook-conspiracy-ban-b1765703.html):

> The new rules come as a coronavirus vaccine becomes more likely in the coming days after Wednesday's Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine announcement. "This could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines. For example, we will remove false claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn't on the official vaccine ingredient list", Facebook said in its announcement. It added that it will also remove conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines that we know today are false, such as that specific populations are being forced to test the vaccine against their will.

## RCMP could easily identify officers accused of sexual assault, says former Supreme Court justice | "Like the Catholic Church, they just move them to another parish. I have a list [of RCMP officers] who have been found guilty up to 15 times. Those people have been promoted."

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/michel-bastarache-rcmp-sexual-assault-1.5825438?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar):

> His appearance before the standing committee on national security comes two weeks after he released a scathing report on sexual harassment in the RCMP. Bastarache was tasked with independently assessing the claims made as part of the Merlo-Davidson settlement. "The level of violence and sexual assault that was reported was shocking. Indeed, over 130 claimants disclosed penetrative sexual assaults," Bastarache's report says. There are calls for an independent review following a report into sexual harassment within the RCMP. The report's author described the accounts as "Shocking" and as signs of "Systemic" problems with misogyny, racism and homophobia.

> Exact thing happened near me. One RCMP officer got caught for dropping tickets for sexual favours.  He also stalked women he found appealing and used the police database to run their plates to get their home addresses.
> 
> Once caught he got put back into the shuffle. Last I heard he was still working.

## More than 400 lawmakers from 34 countries back 'Make Amazon Pay' campaign

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-protests-idUSKBN28D2ET):

> 3 Min Read.LONDON - More than 400 lawmakers from 34 countries have signed a letter to Amazon.com Inc boss Jeff Bezos backing a campaign that claims the tech giant has "Dodged and dismissed debts to workers, societies, and the planet," organisers said. The "Make Amazon Pay" campaign was launched on Nov. 27 - the annual Black Friday shopping bonanza - by a coalition of over 50 organisations, with demands including improvements to working conditions and full tax transparency. Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions, saying it represented less than 1% of the global retail market and there were larger retailers in every country in which it operated.
