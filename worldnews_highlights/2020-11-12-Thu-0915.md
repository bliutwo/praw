## UK officially states China has now broken the Hong Kong pact, considering sanctions

Summary of [original article](https://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKKBN27S1E4):

> 4 Min Read.LONDON - Britain on Thursday said China had broken its main bilateral treaty on Hong Kong by imposing new rules to disqualify elected legislators in the former British colony, cautioning that it would consider sanctions as part of its response. The British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War.Hong Kong's autonomy was guaranteed under the "One country, two systems" agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Opposition members of the Hong Kong assembly say they have tried to make a stand against what many people in Hong Kong see as Beijing's whittling away of freedoms and institutional checks and balances, despite a promise of a high degree of autonomy.

Reality is more than catchy headlines and your unwillingnes to reflect on foreign things from a different perspective than your own american one.

> Travelers desperate to cross borders are buying fake coronavirus test results or falsifying their own in an attempt to bypass regulations. Over in England, a man from Blackburn told the Lancashire Telegraph how easy it was to get counterfeit test results marked negative and simply change the name, birthdate, and testing date. According to USA Today, as of now, counterfeit test results don't seem to be as common in the United States because of widespread access to COVID-19 testing.

> There is no significant difference in the way humans and horses experience the pain of being struck by a whip, according to a landmark study that researchers say should end the argument on the continued use of the whip in horse racing. The study found there was "No significant difference between the epidermal nerve counts of humans and horses", meaning that humans and horses had a similar sensitivity to pain. The University of Sydney's Prof Paul McGreevy said the study should end the argument that whipping does not hurt horses.

## Europe to pay less than US for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/11/11/coronavirus-europe-to-pay-less-than-us-for-pfizer-vaccine):

> Under the EU's deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator. French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September. Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed.

> 
> I think this is the key statement in the article. Unlike Trump's refuted claims that the US put money towards the vaccine, the company acknowledges that Germany/The EU **actually did**. And they are willing to take this into account when selling.
