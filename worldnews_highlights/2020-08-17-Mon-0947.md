> This is huge. Overthrowing a government often requires people to feel like there is a chance of winning... The media plays a big part in the national mood and seeing an empty sound stage really fortifies the protestors and shows that the state is not fully control (jackboot thugs in the street beating protestors aside.)

> Reminds me of Nataliya Dmytruk, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataliya_Dmytruk, the sign language interpreter who, on live Ukrainian State TV, refused to interpret that Yanukovych had won after a rigged election, and instead stated that Yushchenko should be the legitimate winner.

## Iran paid bounties for targeting US troops, intelligence reportedly suggests

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/512273-iran-paid-bounties-for-targeting-us-troops-intelligence-reportedly-suggests):

> U.S. intelligence reportedly indicates Iran's government offered bounties to Taliban fighters to target U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan. While the government in question is classified in the memo, two sources familiar with the intelligence told the network it was in reference to Iran. The briefing document stated that the Bagram attack likely qualified for compensation from the foreign government "Based on the nature of the attack and agreed upon bounties." Although U.S. intelligence said the Haqqani network had reason to target the base without a financial motivator, CNN noted that the document states the alleged funding "Probably incentivizes future high-profile attacks on US and Coalition forces."

> You're fucking kidding me right? This is like, general knowledge in the military. We captured tons of Iranian equipment and weapons in Iraq, and captured enemy routinely told us they were trained and paid by Iran. Iranian forces have paid bounties on US troops in Iraq for *years.* I know first hand, because I was there and physically captured some of these people and they not only told us, but they had Iranian weapons and the like. Part of my job was to interrogate these guys and pass the information up.

> >MICHAEL WARE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): **These American soldiers might not know it, but they have a bounty on their heads, according to U.S. military intelligence.** A senior U.S. military official tells CNN Iran's Quds Force is offering reward money to Iraqi militia who kill G.I.s. The Quds Force is an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
