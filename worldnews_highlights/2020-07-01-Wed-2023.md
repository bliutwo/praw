Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-referendum-putin-rule-2036-yes-vote-a9595711.html):

> Oiled by the Kremlin's election machine, the result of Vladimir Putin's vote on constitutional reform - one that would allow him to rule until 2036 - was never in doubt. Mr Putin said that election manipulation methods such as forced voting, "Rounding errors" in counting and inflating turnout were "Inadmissible". On Thursday, the first day of voting, Pavel Lobkov, a journalist for the independent Dozhd television channel, reported he had managed to vote twice.

## Taliban sources confirm: Russia did pay extremists to attack US soldiers

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-did-pay-extremists-attack-american-soldiers-taliban-sources-say-2020-7):

> Taliban commanders have confirmed that Russia has offered financial and material support to its members in exchange for attacking US forces in Afghanistan. Three separate Taliban sources told Insider that they were aware of Russian bounty payments being made - though they stressed that only the less-disciplined elements on the fringes of the group would take up such an offer. He said said that Russian influence inside the Taliban itself was impossible, but that there were many affiliated groups that have maintained ties with Russia.

> AP is reporting that [Bolton told Trump about the Russian bounties back in 2019](https://apnews.com/425e43fa0ffdd6e126c5171653ec47d1):
> 
> >Then-national security adviser **John Bolton also told colleagues he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019.**
> 
> He isn't the only person that told Trump.  You can be sure that other people in the CIA, DoD, NSC, etc, told this to Trump, over the span of the last 1.5 years.  There were multiple high level discussions about this Russian bounty at the NSC, including formulating policy responses to it, including sanctions on Russia.  And this intelligence was passed to allies of the US.
> 
> You don't formulate policy responses like sanctions and also pass this intelligence off to allies unless it is credible and unless the President of the US knows about it.
> 
> The fact that Trump tried to invite Putin back into the G7, despite knowing about the Russian bounty, is a betrayal to the US, and it's a betrayal to US troops.  SMH.

## Anonymous Hackers Target TikTok: ‘Delete This Chinese Spyware Now’

Summary of [original article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/07/01/anonymous-targets-tiktok-delete-this-chinese-spyware-now/#4ab6b02035cc):

> As things stand, TikTok has been pulled from the App Store and Play Store in India, its largest market, and has seen similar protests from users in other major markets around the world, including the U.S. One of the more unusual groups campaigning against TikTok is the newly awakened Anonymous hactivist group. The original issue that prompted Anonymous to target TikTok appears to be the "Misrepresentation" of Anonymous on TikTok itself, with the setting up of an account. "Anonymous has no TikTok account," the same Twitter account tweeted on June 6, "That is an App created as spyware by the Chinese government."

## U.S. says leaking nuclear waste dome is safe; Marshall Islands leaders don’t believe it

Summary of [original article](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-07-01/us-says-nuclear-waste-safe-marshall-islands-runit-dome):

> In response to a directive from Congress, the Department of Energy released a report this week assessing the risks of a 50-year-old cracking and crumbling concrete nuclear waste repository in the Marshall Islands, but the findings did little to ease the concerns of Marshallese leaders in the Central Pacific. "We don't expect the Enewetak community to feel any safer based on this report as it doesn't contain any new information from what they've seen...and don't trust," said Rhea Christian-Moss, the chairperson of the Marshall Islands' National Nuclear Commission, a government-operated nuclear waste and radiation oversight panel. In 2019, at a presentation delivered in the Marshall Islands to Marshallese and U.S. officials, the DOE's contractor, Hamilton, mentioned elevated levels of radioactivity in giant clams living near the dome.

> "Not significant" means "we won't fix it" not "it won't kill people, mutate fish, or otherwise wreck the environment".

## Germany to dissolve special forces unit over far-right links

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-army-farright/germany-to-dissolve-special-forces-unit-over-far-right-links-idUSKBN2412VH):

> BERLIN - Germany's defence minister plans to disband a company of its elite KSK special forces in a effort to purge them of a persistent problem of far-right extremism, a ministry document obtained by Reuters on Tuesday showed. In June, a KSK captain asked Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to intervene in a 10-page letter in which he accused instructors and senior commandos in the unit of cultivating a "Toxic culture of acceptance" under which complaints about far right influence were suppressed. As part of Kramp-Karrenbauer's crackdown on the far right, KSK operations will be moved to other units as far as possible and the commando unit's exercises and international cooperation endeavours will be suspended until further notice.

## UK will open path to citizenship for 3m Hong Kong citizens, PM says

Summary of [original article](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/hong-kong-boris-johnson-pmqs-citizenship-uk-china-law-a4485601.html):

> Boris Johnson says the UK will open a pathway to British citizenship for around three million Hong Kong British National passport holders as a result of China's new security law. "Responding to Tory MP for Bracknell James Sunderland, who asked what message the PM might have for the people of Hong Kong, Mr Johnson said:"We stand for rules and obligations and we think that is the soundest basis for our international relations and the enactment and imposition of this national security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British joint declaration. The Prime Minister's comments came after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier on Wednesday accused China of a "Clear and serious violation" of a treaty forged with the UK by imposing the new national security law on Hong Kong.

`/u/SecondAccount404` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/hj8ku0/uk_will_open_path_to_citizenship_for_3m_hong_kong/):

> For the curious this translates to about 40% of Hong Kongs entire population.

## China is breaking Hong Kong treaty with UK, says Boris Johnson

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/01/china-is-breaking-hong-kong-treaty-with-uk-says-boris-johnson):

> Boris Johnson denounced China's imposition of a security law on Hong Kong as a "Clear and serious" violation of its treaty with Britain, vowing to introduce a bespoke five-year visa for as many as 2.9 million Hong Kong citizens with British national status. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, welcomed the citizenship offer but pressed Raab to urge UK businesses in Hong Kong such as Standard Chartered not to be complicit in the repression. He pointed out: "The imposition of this legislation by the government in Beijing, rather than it being left to Hong Kong's own institutions, was in direct conflict with article 23 of China's own Basic Law for Hong Kong which affirms that Hong Kong should bring forward national security legislation on its own."
