## Manafort shared campaign info with Russian intelligence officer, Senate panel finds

Summary of [original article](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/512526-manafort-shared-campaign-info-with-russian-intelligence-officer):

> Former Trump campaign manager had deep ties to a Russian intelligence officer and secretly shared campaign information, according to a sweeping Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday. "The Committee found that Manafort's presence on the Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for the Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump Campaign. The Committee assesses that Kilimnik likely served as a channel to Manafort for Russian intelligence services, and that those services likely sought to exploit Manafort's access to gain insight [into] the Campaign," the committee found. ADVERTISEMENT. The decision by the Senate Intelligence Committee to identify Kilimnik as a Russian intelligence officer goes a step further than former special counsel , who identified Kilimnik as an individual the FBI assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence but did not call him an intelligence agent.

## Female-led countries handled coronavirus better, study suggests

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/female-led-countries-handled-coronavirus-better-study-jacinda-ardern-angela-merkel):

> Countries led by women had "Systematically and significantly better" Covid-19 outcomes, research appears to show, locking down earlier and suffering half as many deaths on average as those led by men. The analysis of 194 countries, published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the World Economic Forum, suggests the difference is real and "May be explained by the proactive and coordinated policy responses" adopted by female leaders. Since only 19 of the nearly 200 countries were led by women, the authors also created so-called "Nearest neighbour" countries to offset the small sample size, pairing Germany, New Zealand and Bangladesh with male-led Britain, Ireland and Pakistan.

`/u/LuckyandBrownie` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ic4c4y/femaleled_countries_handled_coronavirus_better/):

> Probably more to do with countries the are more progressive. If you have a female leader you are in a progressive country.

## Amazon continues to burn in 2020 despite promises to save it

Summary of [original article](https://apnews.com/56a278cf4b849dc06dadc309d06aa63f):

> NOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil - A year ago this month, the forest around the town of Novo Progresso erupted into flames - the first major blazes in the Brazilian Amazon's dry season that ultimately saw more than 100,000 fires and spurred global outrage against the government's inability or unwillingness to protect the rainforest. As smoke wreaths Novo Progresso, this year's burning season could determine whether Bolsonaro, an avid supporter of bringing more farming and ranching to the Amazon, is willing and able to halt the fires. Speaking at a video summit about the Amazon with fellow South American leaders, he also touted a year-on-year decrease in July deforestation data, omitting the fact it was still the third-highest reading for any month since 2015."This story that the Amazon is burning is a lie," he claimed, even as smoke from more than 1,100 fires wafted over the region that day.
