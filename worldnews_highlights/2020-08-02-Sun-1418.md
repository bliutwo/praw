## Americans Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/02/898165324/americans-go-home-canadians-track-u-s-boaters-sneaking-across-the-border?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news):

> Americans, Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border U.S. pleasure boats have been sneaking into Canada despite a border shutdown. Canada's border patrol has effectively prevented caravans of Americans - and their RVs and their campers - from surging across the border as they normally do each summer. American yachts sneaking across the border makes Creek, and a lot of other Canadians, angry.

## Shocked doctors find bullet lodged in brain of ‘sleepy’ Palestinian 9-year-old, remove it

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/shocked-doctors-find-bullet-lodged-in-brain-of-sleepy-9-year-old-remove-it/):

> A nine-year-old boy from East Jerusalem is recovering after doctors at Hadassah Medical Center removed a bullet that hit him in the head, passed through his brain, ground to a halt upon reaching the inside of his skull and then migrated back into his brain. Neurosurgeon Guy Elor told The Times of Israel he was "Amazed" that even though the bullet went through "Very important brain structures," the boy was chatting and recovering, and was expected to have minimal brain damage or none at all. Elor said the child was "Very lucky," commenting: "Had the bullet gone in at another angle it would have caused much more damage to the brain and left significant neurological damage."

## Facebook announced Saturday it has obeyed a Brazilian judge’s order for a worldwide block on the accounts of 12 of President Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters who are under investigation for allegedly running a fake news network.

Summary of [original article](https://time.com/5874695/facebook-blocks-accounts-worldwide/):

> Facebook announced Saturday it has obeyed a Brazilian judge's order for a worldwide block on the accounts of 12 of President Jair Bolsonaro's supporters who are under investigation for allegedly running a fake news network. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said Friday night that the company had failed to fully comply with a previous ruling ordering the accounts to be shut down, saying they were still online and publishing by changing their registration to locations outside Brazil. Facebook issued a statement saying it complied due to the threat of criminal liability for an employee in Brazil.

## U.S. Missionary With No Medical Training Settles Suit Over Child Deaths At Her Center

Summary of [original article](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/07/31/897773274/u-s-missionary-with-no-medical-training-settles-suit-over-child-deaths-at-her-ce?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_term=nprnews&utm_campaign=npr&utm_medium=social):

> Renee Bach, an American missionary who operated a charitable treatment center for severely malnourished children in Uganda despite having no medical training, has settled a lawsuit brought against her in Ugandan civil court by two women and a civil rights organization. As part of the lawsuit, several former volunteers and staffers at the treatment centers filed affidavits describing incidents during which they witnessed Bach making medical decisions on behalf of children at the center and performing medical procedures, including blood transfusions - often without supervision. The annual death rates at the center - around 20% in 2011 and down to 10% by 2013 - were at levels that would raise red flags by the standards used to judge international charities, according to Saul Guerrero, who specializes in childhood severe acute malnutrition at UNICEF. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015, Bach says the center took in 940 children, of whom 105 died.

## Brexit fuels brain drain as skilled Britons head to the EU - Migration from the UK to remaining EU countries has increased by 30%.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/02/brexit-fuels-brain-drain-as-skilled-britons-head-to-the-eu):

> Using a combination of official statistics across the EU and in-depth interviews with people living in Germany, the study found huge changes in migration patterns of UK citizens since the 2016 referendum, which contrast with largely stable ones among nationals from the 27 EU states remaining in the bloc. Britons living in other EU countries who decided to obtain EU member state passports as well as their UK ones had increased by more than 500% overall, and by 2,000% in Germany. The study found that UK migrants are among the most educated and skilled of those from any nation, with one of the highest net average income rates, suggesting that Brexit has begun a steady drain of the most talented and productive people to the continent.
