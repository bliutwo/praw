## Australia's Great Barrier Reef status lowered to "critical" and deteriorating

Summary of [original article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/australia-great-barrier-reef-critical-deteriorating-mass-bleaching-climate-change/):

> The health status of Australia's Great Barrier Reef has officially declined from "Significant concern" to "Critical" for the first time, the International Union for Conservation of Nature announced this week.

In addition to the Great Barrier Reef, four other Australian world heritage sites - the Blue Mountains, the Gondwana rainforests, the Ningaloo Coast and Shark Bay - have also deteriorated and received lowered statuses.
