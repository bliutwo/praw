## MPs threaten to sue Boris Johnson unless he acts over Russian meddling in UK polls

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/21/mps-threaten-to-sue-boris-johnson-unless-he-acts-over-russian-meddling-in-uk-polls):

> A cross-party group of MPs is threatening to sue Boris Johnson unless he orders an independent investigation into Russian interference in recent UK elections and the 2016 Brexit vote. The MPs say the government's refusal to investigate Kremlin meddling is a breach of the European convention on human rights, which enshrines the right to free elections in article 3. The ISC described the UK as a clear target for Russian disinformation and money laundering, and called on Johnson to launch a full inquiry.

## Koala Habitats that Survived Australia’s Bushfires are Now Being Logged

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8myn/koala-habitats-that-survived-australias-bushfires-are-now-being-logged):

> Despite a number of clear recommendations from that same inquiry-that the NSW government urgently prioritise the protection of koala habitat in urban planning, for example, and that they ban the opening up of old growth forests to logging-the state-owned logging agency Forestry Corporation is continuing to cut down trees in increasingly rare koala habitats. Professor Crowther said that in order to effectively mitigate risks to koala populations, governments need to stop the fragmentation of their habitats, reduce developments near areas of koala populations, invest in research addressing threats to koalas, and implement policies to target some of those other threats, such as climate change. "Any logging of koala habitat at this time, when the full extent of the bushfires on koala and other species populations has yet to be ascertained, is short-sighted and potentially very damaging to the species," he said.

## ‘Very promising’: UK’s first full heroin-prescribing scheme extended after reductions in crime and homelessness - Prison, increased sentencing, police crackdowns and all other efforts to break that cycle have failed,’ says police and crime commissioner

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/heroin-prescription-treatment-middlesbrough-hat-results-crime-homelessness-drugs-a9680551.html):

> The UK's first fully-fledged scheme to provide heroin users with a safe and legal supply of the drug has been extended for a further year, after showing "Very promising results". "The latest analysis suggests the pilot has delivered very promising results and so it was very important we find the funding to continue," said Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger, who launched and part-funds the scheme. "More liberal heroin prescribing could mean that vulnerable people are rescued from the exploitation of organised crime before they are in such a mess, before they've been further traumatised by the system."

## Russian doctors allow Navalny's transfer to Germany

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/alexei-navalny-poisoning-omsk-berlin/a-54645234):

> "At present my husband Alexei Anatolievich Navalny is in the City Clinical Emergency Hospital  1 of Omsk in a serious condition. I believe that Alexei Navalny needs qualified medical care in the Federal Republic of Germany," she wrote. 08:27 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said on Twitter: "We need to be 100% sure that safety of Alexei Navalny is guaranteed." He said Poland supports the efforts to provide Navalny with the best available treatment and that he was concerned about the decision not to let him leave the country. "If true, the suspected poisoning of Russian oppositionist Aleksey Navalny represents a grave moment for Russia, and the Russian people deserve to see all those involved held to account," spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said, using a different spelling for Navalny.
