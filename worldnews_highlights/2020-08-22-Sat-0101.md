> >TASS also reported Friday that an "industrial chemical" identified in samples taken from Navalny was a non-toxic substance commonly found in plastic products, citing the regional branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
> 
> Plastic, itself, is usually toxic unless it's specially treated for medical use. The human stomach cannot digest it, and neither can the trillions of fish suffering from the plastic gum clogging up the oceans. Hopefully he gets better, as the historical precedent should weigh on Putin: Lenin too had to leave Russia as a total failure in 1900 only to return as the leader of the Communists in 1917.

## Koala Habitats that Survived Australia’s Bushfires are Now Being Logged

Summary of [original article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xg8myn/koala-habitats-that-survived-australias-bushfires-are-now-being-logged):

> Despite a number of clear recommendations from that same inquiry-that the NSW government urgently prioritise the protection of koala habitat in urban planning, for example, and that they ban the opening up of old growth forests to logging-the state-owned logging agency Forestry Corporation is continuing to cut down trees in increasingly rare koala habitats. Professor Crowther said that in order to effectively mitigate risks to koala populations, governments need to stop the fragmentation of their habitats, reduce developments near areas of koala populations, invest in research addressing threats to koalas, and implement policies to target some of those other threats, such as climate change. "Any logging of koala habitat at this time, when the full extent of the bushfires on koala and other species populations has yet to be ascertained, is short-sighted and potentially very damaging to the species," he said.

## Russian doctors allow Navalny's transfer to Germany

Summary of [original article](https://www.dw.com/en/alexei-navalny-poisoning-omsk-berlin/a-54645234):

> "At present my husband Alexei Anatolievich Navalny is in the City Clinical Emergency Hospital  1 of Omsk in a serious condition. I believe that Alexei Navalny needs qualified medical care in the Federal Republic of Germany," she wrote. 08:27 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said on Twitter: "We need to be 100% sure that safety of Alexei Navalny is guaranteed." He said Poland supports the efforts to provide Navalny with the best available treatment and that he was concerned about the decision not to let him leave the country. "If true, the suspected poisoning of Russian oppositionist Aleksey Navalny represents a grave moment for Russia, and the Russian people deserve to see all those involved held to account," spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said, using a different spelling for Navalny.
