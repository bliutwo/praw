## Putin Orders New National Mask Mandate as Russia Sees Second COVID-19 Spike

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/putin-orders-new-national-mask-mandate-as-russia-sees-second-covid-19-spike):

> Vladimir Putin on Tuesday made his most direct intervention yet to stave off a second wave of novel coronavirus infections by reintroducing a national mask mandate in Russia, The New York Times reports. Since the end of Russia's first nationwide lockdown, Putin has delegated pandemic measures to regional leaders, so the new mandate marks a change in his government's thinking. It came as Russia recorded more than 16,000 new cases five days in a row.

> Meanwhile he's certainly stoking anti-mask sentiment in the US because he knows we're full of idiots who have been convinced that it's patriotic to spread a virus that has killed hundreds of thousands of americans and can/will kill hundreds of thousands more.

> Yeah, noticed this in Ireland when we had our abortion and gay marriage referendums. Loads of Americans standing on corners, holding up absolutely deplorable signs and funding the nut jobs. It didn't work and I wish you'd just fuck off and stop trying to turn our politics into the detestable shite you've turned yours into.

> AstraZeneca did not provide detail of the data behind the statement or say when it would publish eagerly awaited late-stage phase 3 trial data, which would show whether the vaccine works well enough in large-scale trials for it to be approved. Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July that showed the vaccine generated "Robust immune responses" in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier. "Studies carried out in the first stage of development of a vaccine will result in choosing a dose that does not cause too much reactogenicity," he said.
