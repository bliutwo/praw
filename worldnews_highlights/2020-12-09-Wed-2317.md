## Russian Media Wants Moscow to Grant Asylum to Τrump

Summary of [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-media-wants-moscow-to-grant-asylum-to-trump-to-help-him-dodge-prosecutions?ref=home):

> Affectionately referring to Donald Trump as "Our Donald," "Trumpusha" and "Comrade Trump," Russian lawmakers, experts and pundits repeatedly have expressed their concerns about the future of Moscow's all-time favorite U.S. president. Co-host of Russian state TV news talk show 60 Minutes Olga Skabeeva brought up the possibility that President Trump would end up seeking asylum in Russia to escape any prosecutions in the United States following the conclusion of his sole presidential term. Russian President Vladimir Putin can relate to Trump on a very personal level-not only where it comes to a ruthless pursuit of power, but also with respect to the intense fear of accountability if that power was to ever slip away.

> On the distinct possibility that Russia would actually go for it, I imagine they’d be delighted to have close access to all the classified information Trump is privy to.

## Hackers steal Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine data in Europe, companies say

Summary of [original article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ema-cyber-idUSKBN28J2Q7):

> 3 Min Read.LONDON - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on Wednesday that documents related to their development of a COVID-19 vaccine had been "Unlawfully accessed" in a cyberattack on Europe's medicines regulator. Pfizer and BioNTech said they did not believe any personal data of trial participants had been compromised and EMA "Has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review." The two companies said they had been informed by the EMA "That the agency has been subject to a cyber attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine candidate ... had been unlawfully accessed."

`/u/Parliament_restrtoom` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/k9yxws/hackers_steal_pfizerbiontech_covid19_vaccine_data/):

> Stealing the recipe for the vaccine doesn't do much if a country doesn't have the facilities to produce that vaccine.
> 
> I don't doubt China or Russia has the capacity to build those facilities but most countries don't. Then there's the problem of transporting and keeping the vaccine in ultra cold storage.
