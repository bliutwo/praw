> "A U.S. citizen is among six pro-democracy activists to have arrest warrants issued for them by Hong Kong police for suspected violations under a new national security law, Chinese state media reported late Friday.
> 
> Chu, the managing director of the D.C.-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, an advocacy group, wrote on Twitter that he “woke up to media reports that I am a wanted fugitive.”
> 
> He added that he had been an American citizen for 25 years.
>

> 
> Chu was among six prominent activists named by Chinese broadcaster CCTV and other state media outlets, to have arrest warrants issued for them under the legislation that came into effect on June 30. The individuals were wanted on suspicion of secession or collusion with foreign forces — crimes that the new security law punishes with up to life in prison."

> A nine-year-old boy from East Jerusalem is recovering after doctors at Hadassah Medical Center removed a bullet that hit him in the head, passed through his brain, ground to a halt upon reaching the inside of his skull and then migrated back into his brain. Neurosurgeon Guy Elor told The Times of Israel he was "Amazed" that even though the bullet went through "Very important brain structures," the boy was chatting and recovering, and was expected to have minimal brain damage or none at all. Elor said the child was "Very lucky," commenting: "Had the bullet gone in at another angle it would have caused much more damage to the brain and left significant neurological damage."

## Americans Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border

> Americans, Go Home: Canadians Track U.S. Boaters Sneaking Across The Border U.S. pleasure boats have been sneaking into Canada despite a border shutdown. Canada's border patrol has effectively prevented caravans of Americans - and their RVs and their campers - from surging across the border as they normally do each summer. American yachts sneaking across the border makes Creek, and a lot of other Canadians, angry.

> Facebook announced Saturday it has obeyed a Brazilian judge's order for a worldwide block on the accounts of 12 of President Jair Bolsonaro's supporters who are under investigation for allegedly running a fake news network. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said Friday night that the company had failed to fully comply with a previous ruling ordering the accounts to be shut down, saying they were still online and publishing by changing their registration to locations outside Brazil. Facebook issued a statement saying it complied due to the threat of criminal liability for an employee in Brazil.
