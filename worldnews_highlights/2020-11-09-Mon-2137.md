## Apple supplier Pegatron found using illegal student labor in China

Summary of [original article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apple-supplier-pegatron-found-using-illegal-student-labor-in-china/?comments=1):

> Apple has reprimanded one of its largest manufacturers after a Financial Times investigation found that thousands of student interns had worked overtime to assemble iPhones, in breach of Chinese law. "We have a rigorous review and approval process for any student worker program, which ensures the intern's work is related to their major and prohibits overtime or night shifts. Pegatron misclassified the student workers in their program and falsified paperwork to disguise violations," said Apple. Pegatron said: "During [a] recent monitoring program conducted by our customer, some student workers at Pegatron Shanghai and Kunshan campus were identified working night shifts, overtime and in positions unrelated to their majors, which were not in compliance with local rules and regulations."

`/u/appleburger17` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jr5f4a/apple_supplier_pegatron_found_using_illegal/):

> APPLE CHINA ILLEGAL STUDENT LABOR is a lot better clickbait than "Taiwan company went to extraordinary lengths to evade oversight mechanisms to make adult interns work overtime."

> 1 Min Read.OTTAWA - Canada is sure the U.S. administration of President-elect Joe Biden will reinforce the message to China that its policy of arbitrarily detaining foreign citizens is not working, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday. "(China's) approach around coercive diplomacy is ineffective and extremely preoccupying for democratic nations around the world," he told a news conference. "I am extremely confident that the incoming American administration will continue to be a good partner to Canada and other nations around the world as we look to impress upon China the approach they are taking is simply not working ... the importance of returning the two Canadians," said Trudeau.
