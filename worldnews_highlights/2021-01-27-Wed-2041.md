## US pauses billions in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, UAE

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/27/us-reviewing-billions-in-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-uae):

> The United States is reviewing weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates authorised by former President Donald Trump, a move that Secretary of State Antony Blinken said was "Typical" of a new administration. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Wednesday that the Biden administration has imposed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in weapons sales to the two countries, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and F-35 fighters to the UAE. The move comes one week after Biden, who has promised to "Reassess" Washington's relationship with Riyadh, was inaugurated. In May 2019, the former US president declared a national emergency over tensions with Iran to sidestep objections from Congress about the sale of $8bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan.

> If you read the WSJ article it says that pausing is normal for a new President and it will likely be approved. These headlines are just PR.
> 
> >"U.S. officials said it isnâ€™t unusual for a new administration to review arms sales approved by a predecessor, and that despite the pause, many of the transactions are likely to ultimately go forward."

## The '1%' are the main drivers of climate change, but it hits the poor the hardest: Oxfam report

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/oxfam-report-the-global-wealthy-are-main-drivers-of-climate-change.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=108324171&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LTy3YBKJTLdqjWtuiT_wle7n50bipEF12rKr09U52VKV9UZWgCATjOjOKT5GBU1Yj63kqMAh08_CLRGfl8ZPU715WwA):

> The richest 1% of the global population have used two times as much carbon as the poorest 50% over the last 25 years, the nonprofit's report says. Governments need to implement policies that help reduce overall demand for energy and accelerate the use of renewable energy, according to Oxfam, which means ending subsidies to fossil fuel industries, as well as forcing banks to end investment in fossil fuels and ramp up investment in sustainable energy sources, the report says. Further, says Oxfam, governments should implement scaled taxes on carbon emissions: Luxury-related consumption that drives carbon emissions - such as "Frequent or business class flights" or gas-guzzling large vehicles, according to the report - should be taxed at a higher rate for the carbon consumption.

## Doomsday Clock: Humanity is still closer to apocalypse than ever, experts say

Summary of [original article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/doomsday-clock-2021-news-live-dc-b1793557.html):

> Humanity is still as close to apocalypse as ever before, the scientists behind the "Doomsday Clock" have said. "Because these developments have not yet yielded substantive progress toward a safer world, they are not sufficient to move the Clock away from midnight," the scientists wrote. Two years later, they created the Doomsday Clock, as a way of using the amount of time to midnight, or annihilation, as a way of discussing the danger humanity found itself in.
