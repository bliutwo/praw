## Solar is now ‘cheapest electricity in history’, confirms IEA

Summary of [original article](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea):

> The IEA's main scenario has 43% more solar output by 2040 than it expected in 2018, partly due to detailed new analysis showing that solar power is 20-50% cheaper than thought. The table shows that solar electricity is some 20-50% cheaper today than the IEA had estimated in last year's outlook, with the range depending on the region. In the best locations and with access to the most favourable policy support and finance, the IEA says the solar can now generate electricity "At or below" $20 per megawatt hour.
