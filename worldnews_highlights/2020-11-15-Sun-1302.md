## Religious intolerance is 'bigger cause of prejudice than race', says report.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/15/religious-intolerance-is-bigger-cause-of-prejudice-than-race-says-report):

> Religion is the "Final frontier" of personal prejudice, with attitudes to faith driving negative perceptions more than ethnicity or nationality, a report to be published tomorrow will say. Prejudice based on religion was stronger among people aged over 75, those with no or few educational qualifications, people from non-Asian ethnic minorities, and Baptists. Men appear to be more uncomfortable than women about the idea of a close relative marrying someone from a different ethnic, national or religious background.

> TLDR

> Muslims are the group that face the most intolerance, but they are also the most intolerant group.
> 
> Seems to be a chicken and the egg situation, although perhaps they are unrelated.

## Germans should brace for 4-5 months of severe COVID-19 measures, minister says

Summary of [original article](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN27V080?__twitter_impression=true):

> FRANKFURT - Germans should brace for another 4-5 months of severe measures to halt the rise in coronavirus infections and should not expect the current rules to be eased quickly, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told weekly Bild am Sonntag. His comments echoed those of other leading German policy makers. Among others, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at an online event of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party on Saturday that hard weeks, possibly even months, lie ahead. The German chairman of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, warned of a possible shortage of beds and staffing problems in German hospitals.

`/u/5chneemensch` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jujxv7/germans_should_brace_for_45_months_of_severe/):

> The Bild is not a reliable source. They are also one of the main factors for fearmongering among Corona deniers.

Summary of [original article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/passenger-tests-positive-coronavirus-first-cruise-ship-sail-caribbean-pandemic-n1247552):

> A passenger aboard the first cruise ship to set sail in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a reporter traveling on the ship. The ship was planning on doing a third round of tests on Wednesday when the passenger went to the ship's doctor and said he was feeling sick, Sloan said. Cruise ships were not allowed to sail U.S. waters after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no-sail order in March following coronavirus outbreaks on several ships.

`/u/ControvT` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/juemtr/peru_plunged_into_political_upheaval_as_congress/):

> I'm Peruvian. In my opinion, Merino's resignation is inevitable. All this chaos has snowballed into something that cannot be stopped until he and all his allies are gone. However, it's unclear what will happen after his resignation (will we have a new temporary president? hurry the elections? a provisional assembly?). I'm worried about our future. Hopefully, this will teach our population to vote with responsibility next year.
> 
> Two young men died today as a result of police brutality. They were around my age, students as I am. I can't imagine the pain their parents are going through right now, seeing their deaths publicly broadcast and their bodies so broken. It's so fucking sad.
