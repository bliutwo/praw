## Bottled water is 3,500 times worse for the environment than tap water, according to Barcelona Institute for Global Health

Summary of [original article](https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/08/05/bottled-water-is-3-500-times-worse-for-the-environment-than-tap-water-say-scientists):

> Tap water is thousands of times better for the environment than bottled water, according to scientists. This would be 1400 times more of an impact on ecosystems and 3500 times higher cost to the environment for resources, than if the whole city were to drink tap water instead. The use of bottled water has risen in recent years in part due to factors such as taste, odour, marketing campaigns and lack of public faith in the quality of tap water. "Our results show that considering both the environmental and the health effects, tap water is a better option than bottled water, because bottled water generates a wider range of impacts", says ISGlobal researcher Cathryn Tonne.

> 
> flag anthem, not national anthem. It leaves a little wiggle room from forcing a strong reaction from mainland.

## British government ‘named and shamed’ 191 companies for paying less than minimum wage

Summary of [original article](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employers-named-and-shamed-for-paying-less-than-minimum-wage):

> 30% failed to pay workers for all the time they had worked, such as when they worked overtime. Employers who pay workers less than the minimum wage have to pay back arrears of wages to the worker at current minimum wage rates. The government is committed to protecting workers' rights and while the vast majority of businesses follow the law and uphold workers' rights, the publication of this list serves as a reminder to employers that the government will take action against those who fail to pay their employees the minimum wage.

## Facebook let fossil-fuel industry push climate misinformation, report finds

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/facebook-fossil-fuel-industry-environment-climate-change):

> Facebook failed to enforce its own rules to curb an oil and gas industry misinformation campaign over the climate crisis during last year's presidential election, according to a new analysis released on Thursday. Exxon alone spent $5m."The industry is using a range of messaging tactics that are far more nuanced than outright statements of climate denial. Some of the most significant tactics found included tying the use of oil and gas to maintaining a high quality of life, promoting fossil gas as green, and publicizing the voluntary actions taken by the industry on climate change," the report said. The report noted a rise in spending on Facebook ads in July 2020, immediately after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $2tn climate plan to promote the use of clean energy.

`/u/Pretzel_Boy` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/oybmfj/facebook_let_fossilfuel_industry_push_climate/):

> I think this can be shortened to "Facebook lets anyone spread misinformation".
