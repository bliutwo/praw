## Taliban willing to establish relations with all nations except Israel

Summary of [original article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/taliban-willing-to-establish-relations-with-all-nations-except-israel/):

> The Taliban are willing to establish ties with all countries except for Israel, a spokesman said Tuesday as the extremist group announced its new government after taking control of Afghanistan. Spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Russia's Sputnik news that The Taliban were willing to work with the US after they swiftly toppled the 20-year-old Western-backed government last month just as President Joe Biden was completing a pullout to end America's longest war. Last month, Shaheen caused some surprise when he gave an interview to Israel's Kan public broadcaster he later said he had been mislead. Shaheen, who has been giving interviews in English from Qatar since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan, said he had no idea that he was speaking to someone from an Israeli news organization.
