## Senegal: Women demonstrate against 'rape culture' in Dakar

Summary of [original article](http://www.africanews.com/2021/07/04/senegal-protesters-denounce-violence-against-women/):

> Dozens of feminist demonstrators on Saturday in Dakar, Senegal's capital denounced the justice system and the excessive tolerance towards violence against women in Senegal. In January 2020, Senegal passed a law that criminalises rape and paedophilia after active campaigns by civil society, particularly organizations advocating for women's rights. The massive campaign that followed the rape and murder of two women in 2019 propelled the government into drafting the newly adopted law.

## Western Canada burns, deaths mount after world’s most extreme heat wave in modern history

Summary of [original article](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/western-canada-burns-deaths-mount-after-worlds-most-extreme-heat-wave-modern-history):

> Focusing only on factors such as heat stroke "Gives you a massive underestimate of the overall [death toll]." Many heat wave deaths are triggered by respiratory and cardiovascular failures often under-recognized as being related to the torrid, often-polluted air of a heat wave. Never in the century-plus history of world weather observation, have so many all-time heat records fallen by such a large margin than in the past week's historic heat wave in western North America. The only heat wave that compares is the great Dust Bowl heat wave of July 1936 in the US Midwest and south-central Canada.
