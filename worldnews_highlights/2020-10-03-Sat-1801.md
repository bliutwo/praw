Videos show a 16-year-old boy being bundled over the railings of a bridge by a police officer. Chile's public prosecutor has said that since last October 8,575 alleged human rights violations have been perpetrated by the Carabineros in the repression of protests, and only 16 police agents have been stood down as a result.

## New Zealand refuses quarantine-free trips from Australia as Australian Capital Territory joins travel bubble: NZ PM Jacinda Ardern says her country will not open up until Australia records a month without community transmission of Covid-19

Asked whether WA would consider a travel bubble with South Australia and the Northern Territory, where case numbers are similarly low, the premier said there was "No benefit" and it would only result in WA losing tourist dollars.

> Am in France and was in Italy a week ago. It’s anecdotal but there’s a visible difference in how people are behaving. Masks and sanitizer everywhere in Italy and rules like not putting people on tables close to each other. Limited amount of people in shops - the rest are waiting outside.
> In France everyone seems so relaxed, young and old. Packed restaurants inside with most of the staff wearing masks on their chins. Empty sanitizer bottles laying around in bars, cafes and restaurants. Just left a fast food place and there was no soap in the toilet.
