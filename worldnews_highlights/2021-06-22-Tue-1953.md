## WHO says delta is the fastest and fittest Covid variant and will ‘pick off’ most vulnerable

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/covid-delta-who-says-variant-is-the-fastest-and-fittest-and-will-pick-off-most-vulnerable-.html):

> The highly contagious delta variant is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain yet, and it will "Pick off" the most vulnerable people, especially in places with low Covid-19 vaccination rates, World Health Organization officials warned Monday. A variant can be labeled as "Of concern" if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments, according to the health organization. The delta variant now makes up more than 60% of new cases in the U.K. WHO officials have said there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions.

## China has ramped up its use of secret detention without trial, creating one of the most far-ranging systems of forced disappearance in the world, human rights activists warn in a report.

Summary of [original article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/22/china-stepping-up-use-secret-detention-without-trial-report-warns?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other):

> China has ramped up its use of secret detention without trial, creating one of the most far-ranging systems of forced disappearance in the world, human rights activists warn in a report. "These estimations are merely for those that have, or will, face trial and have a verdict delivered by court. A great many - amount unknown - will not face trial after their RSDL placement and those cases will never be identifiable in any officially available data," the group said in its letter to the UN.The number also covers cases, not persons, and some will involve more than one person. Although RSDL detention is not meant to last more than six months under Chinese law, it has repeatedly been extended beyond this, the report notes.
