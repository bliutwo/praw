## Capybara population 'wreaking havoc' in wealthy community in Argentina

Summary of [original article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/09/02/capybara-invading-lawns-wealthy-area-argentina/5699253001/):

> Capybaras have destroyed lawns, caused traffic jams and even bitten residents' dogs in a community in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Some in the country are celebrating the capybaras, referred to as carpinchos in Argentina, invading the wealthy, gated community that sits on the wetlands of the Paraná, one of the world's largest rivers. "It's not an invasion. That was the capybaras' land years ago before this rich community built homes on top of the wetland," Ariel Fernandez told USA TODAY. "So a lot of us in Argentina are rooting for these capybaras to mess with the rich and out of touch. They're wreaking havoc."

> I immediately side with the capybaras.
