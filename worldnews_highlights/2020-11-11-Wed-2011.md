## Europe to pay less than US for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/11/11/coronavirus-europe-to-pay-less-than-us-for-pfizer-vaccine):

> Under the EU's deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator. French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September. Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed.

> 
> I think this is the key statement in the article. Unlike Trump's refuted claims that the US put money towards the vaccine, the company acknowledges that Germany/The EU **actually did**. And they are willing to take this into account when selling.

Summary of [original article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/10/british-companies-will-forced-reveal-sources-raw-materials-new/):

> British companies will be forced to reveal the sources of their raw materials under new laws to clamp down on deforestation, the government has revealed. Sourcing materials in a way which illegally degrades the environment abroad will be made illegal under the Environment Bill, ministers announced, in response to a government consultation. According to a new government report, 80 per cent of deforestation is linked to the expansion of agriculture, with land being cleared to make way for grazing animals and to grow crops.

## Australian parliament to probe Rupert Murdoch’s media dominance

Summary of [original article](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/11/australian-parliament-to-probe-rupert-murdochs-media-dominance):

> Australia's parliament will launch an inquiry into media ownership, a prominent senator said, after more than half a million people signed a petition demanding a probe into Rupert Murdoch's dominance of the news industry. The online petition attracted a record number of signatories after being launched on October 12 by former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a frequent target of newspapers controlled by Murdoch's News Corp. The Australian arm of the New York-based company is the country's largest media organisation, owning papers in nearly every major city as well as cable television networks and magazines. "We are especially concerned that Australia's print media is overwhelmingly controlled by News Corporation, founded by Fox News billionaire Rupert Murdoch, with around two-thirds of daily newspaper readership."

> Australians aren’t the only ones concerned with the power and political influence of Murdoch.

Summary of [original article](https://thepointsguy.com/news/caribbean-cruise-covid-scare-seadream/):

Summary of [original article](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/11/11/world-leaders-urged-stand-democracy-and-refuse-meet-pompeo-after-he-denies-election):

"Foreign leaders and diplomats must stand up for democracy and refuse to meet with Secretary Pompeo until he publicly recognizes victory in the 2020 election, facilitates a smooth transition to the incoming administration, and removes himself from partisan politics," added Sippel.

## Deutsche Bank proposes a 5% 'privilege' tax on people working from home

Summary of [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-bank-working-from-home-tax-staff-workers-businesses-2020-11):

> Sorry, we were unable to get the summary of this article.

`/u/Still_Mighty` [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/jsc8rr/deutsche_bank_proposes_a_5_privilege_tax_on/):

> > "The $48 billion raised could pay for a $1,500 grant to the 29 million workers who cannot work from home and earn under $30,000 a year," he said.
> 
> It *could* pay for a grant but we all know it fucking *won’t*.
> 
> Edited to add: why is it considered a privilege to now work from home if it turns out your job was always capable of being fully remote? This pandemic exposed so many problems with the workforce that are now being solved as a way to deal with the crisis. It’s brought on a new way of approaching labor for so many industries that now allow people to live in lower cost areas and have a better work-life balance and lessens the number of people on the roads and reduces carbon emissions... these changes feel long overdue. 
> 
> For Deutsche Bank to look at that and complain that people aren’t paying enough for the benefit of the betterment of society at large is mind-bogglingly tone deaf.

## Chickens culled as third outbreak of bird flu detected in England

Summary of [original article](https://metro.co.uk/2020/11/11/chickens-culled-as-third-outbreak-of-bird-flu-detected-in-england-13579995/):

> A chicken culling is underway after a third outbreak of bird flu was detected in England in just over a week. Bird flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds but is rarely spread to humans. The risk level of bird flu - also known as avian influenza incursion in wild birds - was recently raised to 'high' in the UK. It comes after a series of outbreaks were reported across Europe in the past few weeks.
